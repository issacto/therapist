"Yes, it is common for people to experience feelings of being ""out to get"" or ""hyped"" by others. This is sometimes called ""gaslighting,"" where someone tries to make you doubt your own perception of reality and create a sense of confusion and unease. Gaslighting can be a form of emotional abuse, where the perpetrator is attempting to control and manipulate you, and make you question your own thoughts and feelings. It can be a common behavior among people who are afraid or upset, and often takes the form of threatening or intimidating behavior, or making you doubt your own reality.

It is essential to be aware of these behaviors and to avoid becoming overly suspicious or paranoid. It is also important to speak up and seek help if you are experiencing these types of behaviors. Remember, everyone has their own reasons for acting the way they do, and it is essential to be patient and compassionate with yourself and others.'}]"
