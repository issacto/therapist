"<s>[INST] My mother has resented and (i believe) hated me since birth. She never hugged me or even touched me unless hitting me with a belt. She never said ” I love you” even once when growing up. 17 years later gave birth to my sister. She is treated with golden gloves. She has worshiped her since her birth. I can’t understand it. I was a wonderful, quiet, respectful child. I did anything and everything trying to get her to love me. I made straight A’s all 12 years of school. Teachers always thought I should have been promoted but my mother never allowed it. Now at 51, after years of therapy, I still can’t get past how they STILL treat her like a princess and never even think of me or my feelings. Right now my parents, sister, her hubby and children have taken a family vacation, which parents paid for, to Rome, Italy. Me, my kids or grand kids weren’t invited. So now we all feel hurt and don’t understand why. This is only one example . There are so many times in my life my mom has hurt me in similar fashion. I wasn’t allowed around my sister while she was growing up so I couldn’t influence her. They told her they didn’t want her to turn out like me so I never got to see her. I wasn’t promiscuous, didn’t do drugs, graduated with honors (they didn’t even go to my graduation). My sister sees this difference but doesn’t care. She makes comments at family get togethers how they love her more. Not that it’s not obvious to everyone already. I went to therapy for years. Therapist said the only way to get past was to confront them. It took me until I was 39 to do this. I told them how I have felt, gave examples, even begged for them to explain why. What did I do? My mother immediately tried to slap me and said I was lying. She has said many many times that I have been a liar my whole life. I do not lie. After her 4th attempt to slap me, my father came in. I explained again and he acknowledged that they did do this. He tried to get my mother to say it, but she would not. She stormed out of my home and as she left, told my 14year old she was sorry she had to live with such a crazy liar like me. My dad apologized and left. Now she tries to hide her hate for me but it shines through. She lies to me about what all they do for my sister and family so I won’t know she is still doing the same things. Such as the trip to Rome. They told me they were just going to her house to help her with the kids for a few weeks because she was so overwhelmed. My sister is married to a very successful man. Wants for nothing. He loves her dearly and she him also. She doesn’t WORK, but she is overwhelmed with two very behaved fantastic boys. She lives 75 miles from mom. I live less than 10 but they will not come to my home to help me at all. I am a single grandparent now raising my grand kids because my daughter has brain damage and she is bipolar. They all hate her as if she could change if she wanted. I was left out of their will as well as my kids. But somehow she still believes we are treated equal. They have never once taken me out for my birthday but take her very year. They go to her house and stay for weeks at a time but will not come to mine. Nothing changed after our discussion. Same things still happening and I can’t seem to let go even after years of therapy because it is still going on and because she wouldn’t acknowledge how she treated me at our pow wow. She has never once said she was sorry for anything she has done and still doing. How do I get past? [/INST]  I am so sorry you have to go through all of this with your family. But you need to find comfort in knowing that you have tried everything, and your mother’s pathology is profound. Love, therapy, confrontation, and trying to enlist your father’s help has all been a valued effort at changing the dynamics, but the bottom line is that it is time for something very different.It is time to grieve.The family you hoped for never happened, the mother you needed and wanted was never a reality. I would encourage you to talk with the therapist about allowing yourself to grieve the loss of this potential. This is important. You did not lose something you had. You are losing the hope of something that never happened.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a young woman in Poland: I had a guy whom I work in one office (open space) with and we were in a relationship. I let him push me sexually and push my boundaries. He touched me and I told him no, I told him I am not ready, this is too soon that I feel bad about it and he did it again and again. He would rub my ladies parts and I enjoyed it, had an orgasm but did not feel okay with that I was sad I told him it was too soon and keep on telling him no in the future and then letting him touch me anyway. Then he told me that I only take and not give anything to him, I was not ready but felt bad about “using him” for pleasure so I let him have sex with me, I felt bad and he was pushing me until I pleased him. [/INST] You’re right. He did do “something bad” to you. He wouldn’t take “no” for an answer. Although he accused you of being a “taker”, I think he was projecting his own beliefs and behavior on to you. He is a taker, not you.Please don’t punish yourself for having given in more than you wanted to. It sounds to me like you were inexperienced and confused by his behavior. You didn’t know how to assert yourself and he is an excellent manipulator. What is important is that you learned from the experience and that you are now in a relationship that is appropriate and mutually caring.Avoid the guy in the office as much as you reasonably can. You don’t owe him anything. If he behaved inappropriately at work, do consider making a confidential report of his behavior to the Human Resources Dept. I suspect you aren’t the first person to be hurt by this guy. HR can only act on someone like this if people come forward.Confronting your ex yourself is not likely to be helpful since he is so good at blaming others. Instead, focus on this new relationship with a great guy.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m 16 years old and I’ve been dating the same guy for 2 1/2 years. And I still love him. We fight alot and we break up and always get back together some times in hours or a few days but we always end up back together. I do everything for him. I do anything he needs and wants. But some how I always screw up. It’s always my fault. A few months ago I reiliezed I was pregnant. I would get morning sickness I haven’t got my period in 3 months and when I would stand up for a ling period or time I would get dizzy and nearly pass out. I tried telling my boyfriend and he doesn’t believe me. He doesn’t listen . And I need him more then anything. My mom had me when she was 15 and my grandma raised me. I grew up with my family always telling me not to make the same mistakes and I have . I can’t tell my family that in pregnant so I only have my boyfriend. We recently broke up a few days ago and I try talking to him but he’s ignoring me now. He doesn’t understand what in going threw and that I need him by myside. I need help I don’t know what to do.. [/INST]  What you need to do is immediately tell an adult you trust that you are pregnant. You can’t hide a pregnancy forever. I’m so, so sorry it took this long for you to reach out for some help. Every day that you keep it a secret, you and your baby aren’t getting the care you need for you both to be healthy.Your boyfriend is distancing because he is scared. He doesn’t want the responsibilities of fatherhood. Unfortunately, the two of you didn’t think things through before you had unprotected sex. Now a baby is coming into the world who needs both of you to grow up and fast. Your baby needs you to see a doctor to make sure everything is all right. You need to be taking prenatal vitamins and to be eating right and getting enough sleep. Soon you need to take childbirth classes so you will know what to expect when the time comes for you to deliver. As scared as your boyfriend is, he can’t ignore the situation either. He is the father. What he does or doesn’t do about it now is likely to affect how he sees himself for the rest of his life.You and your boyfriend need to have a serious talk with a counselor about whether you are going to raise this child or relinquish it to a couple who wants and can emotionally and financially afford a child. Either way, there are important issues to talk about. You may not be ready for the responsibilities that come with parenthood but both you and your boyfriend are changed forever. If you decide to be a family, there are financial and practical decisions to make as well as emotional ones. If you let the child be adopted, you will still both know that you are parents with a child in the world. Counseling may help you make a decision that is right for all three of you.Yes, you made a mistake getting pregnant. But please don’t make another one by continuing to keep it a secret. It doesn’t help anything. In fact, it might be putting you and your baby in danger.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Last year I got influenced by an anorexic friend and I started experiencing eating disorder symptoms. I binged & starved & eventually ended up purging as well. I went to therapy for 6 months & got over all of it. I was eating fine for 3 months, and then I finished therapy. Now I’m having thoughts about eating disorders, calories, all my problem areas, etc. I don’t eat more than 1200 calories, & there’s lots of days where I eat way less. I don’t know what to do, because my parents and everyone else think I got over it already. I can’t tell them that it started again. I also can’t go back to therapy because I can’t afford it. I really don’t want to have this again, especially because I’m only restricting this time around and not binging, and I don’t want to end up in the hospital. I just can’t seem to eat normally though. My head is definitely playing games with me, and I don’t know how to stop it. I don’t have most of the symptoms for anorexia either, besides for restricting. I’m not underweight or feeling cold, etc. So it’s not dangerous, yet. I am totally normal besides for this. I hang out with friends, go to school, work, etc. I am pretty happy with myself, which is also why I don’t understand why I’m doing this to myself. [/INST]  You had previously gone to therapy and it was successful. Try to think back to what about the therapy helped you. Perhaps what you learned in those sessions can assist you now.Part of why you are not returning to therapy is because you can’t afford it but you also don’t want to go. You also don’t believe that your eating disorder is “dangerous [enough] yet” and thus therapy, in your mind, isn’t required yet. I would disagree. Any time you deprive your body of its proper nutrients, it’s being damaged. It’s always dangerous.If you’re a college student, then you can utilize the college counseling center for free. Many college counseling centers provide high-quality services. Utilize those services, if they are available to you.If your parents have health insurance and you’re under 25, then you may be covered under their policies.Community mental health centers are also an option. They offer low-cost or sliding-scale fee psychological services. Sometimes, services are free depending on your level of income.Finally, another idea is to contact your previous therapist and ask for his or her advice. The therapist might be willing to see you temporarily, free of charge, or refer you to a clinic that provides low-cost or free services.Therapy worked well for you in the past. If the problem has returned, then it would be wise to repeat what has proven to be successful in the past. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of all mental illnesses. They are very serious disorders which require treatment. The sooner you seek treatment, the sooner you can eliminate these symptoms and minimize the damage to your body. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Scotland: I’m worried I may have social anxiety but I’m too afraid to go see a doctor, we moved to Scotland a few years ago and I haven’t even registered at a doctors all I can think is I’ll have to speak to a receptionist both on the phone and face to face, sit in a waiting room with other people I don’t know and then talk to a doctor about it all and all of that goes round and round in my head until I feel sick, i barely leave my house for fear of having to talk to anyone which is making it impossible to get a job or make any friends, I even find it hard talking to members of my family that a don’t see every day, I find it nearly impossible to talk to one person and even worse for groups and its just getting worse I basically sit in my room the whole time and have like a panic attack if the phone rings or someone knocks on the door and that’s in the safety of my own home I want help before it gets even worse and I stop going out at all I’m already close to that but I’m too scared to go ask for help even just typing this I have shallow breathing sweaty palms and palpitations please help me [/INST]  Whatever the diagnosis, you are certainly in great distress. As you’ve already discovered, avoiding the issue is only making it worse. Since you do have family, is there anyone you trust enough to help you? Often someone who is afraid on their own can lean on a trusted family member or friend. The support person can make the phone call and accompany you to your appointments and wait for you until your appointment is over.You might also find it helpful to read a couple of books about anxiety disorders. “Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy” by David Burns and “The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook” by Edmund Bourne are two that have helped many of my clients. You might also benefit by joining one of the forums here on PsychCentral.Please take some steps to help yourself. This isn’t going to get better on its own. You deserve to have a less stressed life.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My brother is 29 years old and has never had a job or driver’s license, and rarely leaves the house. Hi, I am concerned about my brother. He is 29 years old, still lives at home with my mother, has never had a job or a driver’s license, and rarely leaves the house. He has no friends other than people he may talk to online. He does not take very good care of himself and is in the process of getting a full set of dentures. He either forgets to shower or he doesn’t care to shower. He’s been a little different ever since we were younger and he was bullied extensively in high school. He did have a few friends in high school but they’ve all moved on with their lives. He never went to college or did much at all after graduation. [/INST]  Dear worried sister, on the basis of a short letter, it’s difficult for me to identify the exact nature of the problem. Your brother may be mentally ill, but he needs to be evaluated by a mental health professional to determine if a disorder is present.Mental illness might be part of the problem but so might your mother’s treatment of your brother. She protects and defends him. She is enabling his lifestyle. Your brother doesn’t have to change because your mother fully supports his lifestyle.This is a complicated situation because of the family dynamics. If your brother were open to seeing a mental health professional, and if you arranged the consultation, your mother may not even allow it. She might see your attempt to help him as interference.You should encourage your brother to seek help but realize that you have very little control over this situation. Maybe he will take your advice but be prepared for him to reject your ideas. You can’t force your brother into treatment if he is unwilling and, as you noted, he is not dangerous and thus not committable to a hospital.I wish I had a more actionable plan for you, but in life there are situations where you have little or no control and this may be one of them. It can be a difficult psychological realization. Encourage your brother to seek help and perhaps, eventually, he will take your advice. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been with my girlfriend for three years. She comes from a broken home; her mother was a schizoaffective cocaine addict who committed suicide when my girlfriend was 12, and her father is emotionally abusive, driving her to move out when she turned 18 two and a half years ago. We have been living together ever since. About two years ago, she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder after a serious suicide attempt that left her in a coma and subsequent complications that resulted in mild brain damage. She was also diagnosed with PTSD at a young age and recalls being very overly-attached to her mother for most of her childhood. [/INST]  There does seem to be some escalation or change in her symptoms which is worrisome. It’s difficult to know what might be causing it. There are several possibilities including a psychotic disorder like schizophrenia, but it can also be related to stress, PTSD, or her mild brain damage. There may be other possibilities as well. Without a mental health evaluation, it’s difficult to know with certainty what the problem might be.What’s most important is encouraging her to report these symptoms to her treating physicians. They will likely adjust her medications in an effort to target these new symptoms. Her symptoms can likely be controlled with medication. It’s better to treat these symptoms sooner rather than later to prevent them from developing into a psychotic episode or disorder.Because of her symptoms, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for her to trust the people around her, even those close to her. This underscores the importance of her reporting her symptoms and having her medication adjusted. You mentioned wanting her to go to therapy. That might help her in the future, if she were willing to go, but right now what is most important is her consulting with her treating physician about these symptoms. That will give her the best chance of preventing these symptoms from worsening.Finally, if she won’t report her symptoms to her doctor you can report them for her. Privacy laws prevent her doctor or treatment team from discussing her case with you (unless she has given them explicit permission to do so) but there is nothing that prevents you from contacting them to report your concerns. At least they’ll know what’s going on and might be able to help. Please feel free to write again with additional questions. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I don’t understand why, I don’t act feminine, yet so many people, including complete strangers and co-workers keep calling me gay behind my back. I don’t know what to do, because no matter what I do it only gets worse. They do it even more if I: ignore, confront, tell my boss, etc. There seems to be no point even telling a boss because they often do it too and I can’t keep a job because of this ongoing torment! I can’t take legal action for workplace harassment or slander because no one is willing to testify and I can’t get any proof. The worst part is no one has the guts to say it to my face, they are two-faced and whisper (some shout) and laugh behind my back! It reminds me that humans are inherently evil and ignorant and the tactic that many have used since the Roman empire that if you repeat a lie often enough people will believe it to be the truth. Hitler did it and the modern U.S. government uses the same tactic too. It has gotten to the point where life has been complete hell and the only solution I can think of is violence (I won’t go into detail). What do I do? Ignoring isn’t an option because it seems to only encourage them and I can’t keep going from job to job, because this follows me like a curse! [/INST]  Perhaps one of the most important things that we can learn in life, is that we cannot control what other people think. No one controls your thinking and you cannot control anyone else’s thinking. You can behave perfectly, do absolutely nothing wrong, but people will believe whatever they choose to believe. They may think you are self-centered and the truth might be that you are really selfless. They might think that you are very arrogant and the truth is you are very humble.A second important point is that you should not care at all what others think of you. You should care that you are a good person with high moral values. But very few people, even if they knew all of the facts of your life, would be qualified to judge you. And those who are qualified to judge you would likely be the last people in this world to judge you.You say that you cannot get evidence of sexual harassment, yet you mention that sometimes people shout this behind your back. Carrying a small digital recorder should help you capture anything shouted in your direction.Fifty years ago, homosexuals faced severe discrimination, hatred and physical violence. Today we are supposed to be much more enlightened and evolved. A person’s sexual orientation in no way reflects on their moral character or the goodness of their being. It is beyond obvious to say that there are good and evil homosexuals just as there are good and evil heterosexuals.Violence is never justified. Any violence that you would perpetrate on to another would likely result in equal damage to yourself, with imprisonment or even execution. The fact that you feel so angry as to consider violence, is evidence of your possessing a very highly-charged emotional state. Your emotional state could greatly be changed with counseling. Counseling or therapy should be your next step. I wish you the best of luck. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  As far as I can remember I have been easily aroused by women wearing pantyhose. At the age of about 14 or 15 i started wearing pantyhose and masturbating with them. At the time i was ashamed to tell my girlfriend at the time about it. I continued this up until about 19 or 20, when i finally had a girlfriend who i told about my fetish. i thought that by sharing this with my significant other at the time that it would help but it did not. i would just want it more and more. [/INST]  You were right to write. When a fetish is on runaway like this, it interferes with a person’s ability to be true to their own moral code and to function in life. You are certainly at that point. You are not alone. Therapists regularly work with people like yourself.Orgasm is a very powerful reinforcer. It’s readily available. It isn’t expensive. It feels terrific. Doing a behavior (in your case masturbating with pantyhose) can become more and more compelling because the person craves the “reinforcer” of the orgasm. It’s become like an addiction. Crack addicts tell me the same kinds of things. Although they know it’s bad for them, the anticipation of the high is so compelling (and the high feels so good), they can’t stop themselves.You need a therapist, not a letter. You already know that you can’t handle this on your own. I encourage you to seek out a therapist for practical advice and for the support you are going to need to move away from what has become a destructive habit instead of just a way to add a little spice to your sex life.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello , I am a 25 year old MBBS student. I have been suffering from depression since 13 yrs of age. It all started with losing sleep the night before an exam and had very severe negative thoughts later. It resolved after 3 months , had recurrences 4 times, all associated with exams. I wanted to be a doc from childhood and is it because of my over-expectations i am feeling so ? 1. I am on Tab Escitalopram 10mg OD for the past 8 years, it was helpful but is not helping now. 2. I am having obsessive images of places from the past and even after taking this drug , it didnt go away 3. i have lost faith in medication now and is totally hopeless 4. why am i so afraid of exams ,even after writing thousands of exams ?? [/INST]  You are scared of exams because exams are scary for almost everyone. It’s absolutely normal to be stressed. It’s not normal to be so stressed that you get depressed and lose confidence in yourself to this extent. And, no, I don’t think you are expecting too much of yourself. If you want to be a doctor, you need to study and master difficult subjects. That is challenging for anyone. It is also worth doing.I have several suggestions: 1) Please go back to the doctor who prescribed the Lexapro. Talk about whether it is time to discontinue it or to make a change in dosage or in medication.2) Then, please, find a therapist. Anxiety and depression are rarely taken care of by medication alone. You need to learn some new coping skills for dealing with stress. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is generally thought to be the best approach for something like this.3) Talk to someone about whether you have the study skills you need to be the kind of student you want to be. There may be more effective ways to study that will give you more confidence when you are faced with an exam. Make sure you allow plenty of time before the exam to study. Many people find it helpful to have a study buddy; someone who is taking the same subject so you can quiz each other.4) Make sure you are taking good care of yourself. Students who eat right, get enough sleep, and exercise regularly do better on their exams.5) One final hint: Believe it or not, people who get a good night’s sleep the night before, get up early, eat a good breakfast and dress nicely generally do better on exams.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have almost always had minor visual hallucinations (dark figures, geometric patterns, stationary objects look like they’re moving) in the dark (nighttime, dark room, anywhere), deep troubles identifying whether a memory is from real life or a dream, and I get deja vu a few times a week. I did not until recently realize that these could be symptoms of something concerning developing even though the hallucinations always make me very frightened/paranoid. A few years ago auditory hallucinations (muted conversations, can’t distinguish any words) developed. I have never taken any illegal/prescription drugs that could cause hallucinations. Is this simply my adhd causing memory problems and getting bored, or should I be looking into something else? (I should also mention that I suspect that I have borderline personality disorder due to emotional neglect/abuse from my parents and suddenly 4 years ago all my friends (known them for 7+ years) abandoned me. I have little sense of identity, fear of abandonment, frequent and intense mood swings, and splitting on people. However my hallucinations and confused memories are not about any of the traumatic events so I think it is something separate.) [/INST]  You mentioned emotional neglect/abuse from your parents. It’s possible that your symptoms are the result of that trauma. It’s common for people with abuse histories to describe symptoms similar to yours (i.e. mild hallucinations and memory problems).You also said that your friends suddenly abandoned you. You had known them for seven or more years. It’s odd that they would all abandon you all at once. Something must have precipitated their leaving. I’m sure there’s more to the story. These are the types of situations that can be thoroughly examined in counseling.I would recommend consulting a mental health professional. They can gather information about your symptoms and determine what might be wrong. Most importantly, they can design a treatment plan to address your symptoms. That plan might include medication to reduce your hallucinations.Dialectical behavioral therapy is an effective treatment for individuals with borderline personality disorder. Consider choosing a therapist who has been trained to treat borderline personality disorder, if appropriate. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Canada: I’m 13 and there is a person whom is controlling my every thought and movement. I think about them wherever I am and I am always thinking he will be where I am and that they are watching me / will be watching me constantly. [/INST]  No, this isn’t love. Love doesn’t hurt like this. Healthy love brings out the best in us. It doesn’t control a person or prevent a person from enjoying life.I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of a letter, of course. I would need more information than you have provided here. However, one guess is that you have some variation of an anxiety disorder. Anxiety is not at all uncommon for a young teen. There is much to be anxious about in the social world. Many young people are plagued with doubts about how they look, act, and feel. Sometimes those doubts get so intense that a true anxiety disorder is born.In your case, I wonder if you have channeled all that anxiety into concerns about this one person. If so, it is serving the same function as a phobia. Phobias narrow the anxiety into a very particular situation or person or animal, etc. In a way, it frees the person to feel okay as long as the object of the phobia isn’t there. For example: A person with anxiety might develop a phobia about small dogs. As long as he stays away from small dogs, he can function fine.Please consider seeing a mental health counselor. A counselor can hear your whole story and can ask the questions that I can’t. Even an initial session will give you some answers and some suggestions for how to rein in this obsession.I wish you well.  </s>"

Now recently I have been seeing a lot more text messages and photos and at the end of July my mom went to Tennessee with her best friend but I just got on her best friends Facebook today and she had gone to a baseball game with her family the weekend my mom was gone. I am completely heartbroken because my dad is deeply in love with my mom and treats her so well and they have been married for 21 years now. My mom doesn’t like kissing my dad and doesn’t even like hugging him, he doesn’t know anything and it kills me because I know and he doesn’t. I love my dad so much but I don’t know what to do. Because I don’t want to confront my mom because I don’t want to see my family fall apart. But then again it is tearing me apart knowing that my dad treats my mom soooo well and she is taking it forIt all started around last Christmas when my dad bought my mom a ipad, her text messages granted. The other day I was caught crying because I had seen another text message with a picture saying I miss you and love you and it made me so upset, my mom is the one who saw me and she asked me what was wrong ad I refused to tell her. I sometimes see my mom text this number saying I love you. I can’t remember the last time my mom said that to my dad. I don’t know what to do or who to talk too. (age 16, from U.S.) [/INST] A: I’m sorry that you are in this painful position. This is one good reason to respect other people’s privacy. Sometimes we get information that we would rather not have, but once you know it, you can’t go back to not knowing it. As painful as this is for you, your parent’s marriage is not your responsibility. They need to work through their own issues and you need to focus on being a teenager.However, I do think that you need to talk to someone about what you have discovered or it will continue to eat you up inside. I would suggest that you first confide in a trusted adult, possibly an aunt, grandparent or adult family friend. For one, it will relieve some of your stress because you won’t be carrying this burden alone, and second, hopefully this person will have some insight on how best to handle the situation because they know your parents.Unfortunately, affairs are fairly common these days. Some couples are able to work through it and can remain together, others cannot. Either way, I’m sure your parents love you very much and would not want you to be hurt. I’m really sorry that you are going through this and hope that there is a peaceful resolution.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: Hi i have been in a relationship since the 2nd semester of 9th grade, were now 5 years down the road and its not the same, the past 2 years i’ve been trying to break up but every time she says she can’t take it anymore and everyone in her life is leaving her and i’m the last person she has, [/INST] I’m sure this is scary. Your girlfriend is very lucky to have such a caring person as you in her life. But it is only normal for relationships that start so early to end.  You have both grown and changed since you were only 14.  One of the most important tasks of the teen years is to “try on” different relationships  by spending time with a number of different people. It is only by letting yourself get close to others that you can find who will be the best “fit” for you for the long-term.It’s not healthy or appropriate for you to be held hostage by your girlfriend’s  threats to hurt herself. But it is definitely a serious concern. The best way to help her and to extricate yourself is to ask her parents or a teacher or another adult you trust to assist. You can then turn responsibility for her over to someone who can help her deal with a break-up. It is not a betrayal of her trust to do so (even though she may accuse you of doing so). The rules of confidentiality (whether to a friend or a professional) don’t apply when someone is talking about self-harm and suicide.My guess is that her dependence on you is due to her fears about being alone. That suggests a shaky self-esteem and perhaps a significant lack of coping skills. She is avoiding dealing with those problems by leaning on you. An adult who loves her can help her either address those issues directly or get into therapy.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] More than usual I have been obsessed with thoughts of killing myself. More so than any other time in my life.

He thinks I am bipolar and borderline which I had to read up on because I had no idea what it was. All I know is that I can’t go back into the hospital again but the intense feeling to hurt myself is escalating and I am starting to feel so much anxiety and detachment from all aspects of life. I guess my question is, do I change doctors or will things ever get better? [/INST]  It is simply not acceptable for your therapist to become angry when you mention thoughts of suicide. It’s not a professional response. Perhaps there is “more to the story.” You may be correct that he becomes angry but it is also possible that it’s a misunderstanding.Suicidal thoughts should always be taken seriously. They have become an obsession for you. It is important for you to work with a mental health professional with whom you can report your suicidal thoughts. I do not know if things will get better for you with your therapist but if you feel that he can’t help, then you should try a new therapist.It is possible that you have chosen the wrong therapist. It is also possible that you might be misperceiving your therapist’s response. Be very upfront with your therapist. Be frank. Ask, your therapist if he is angry with you. Tell your therapist how you feel and why your feel that way. Never hold anything back from your therapist. When you withhold information from your therapist you are asking them to be more detective than therapist. It might not be appropriate to tell a friend all that you feel. It might not be appropriate to tell your dentist all that you are feeling but is very, very appropriate to tell your therapist. What I am saying is that your therapist is very unique. He or she deals with emotion. You should share all of your thoughts and feelings with your therapist. If you feel pain in your tooth, don’t share that with your therapist. If you feel fear of going to the dentist to have your tooth fixed, share that with your therapist. He will help you overcome that fear.I understand that you do not want to be hospitalized but perhaps a short-term hospital stay is necessary to keep you safe. It may not be ideal but it might be necessary to save your life. If you feel that you cannot keep yourself safe, then you must seek emergency services. Change therapists if necessary and ultimately do what you must to keep yourself safe. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: hello i have a 2 year old son and 5 year old stepson that are brothers. The 5 year old stepson humiliates the 2 year old son by calling him a brat and saying his brother dies. The 5 year old stepson tells the 2 year old son that his toys are worse and uglier than his own toys. [/INST]  From my point of view, both of these little boys are in trouble. It is not usual or normal for a 5-year-old to pick on a 2-year-old. It is not helpful to the 2-year-old’s growth and development to be so dominated by a bully. By all means, set clear limits and consequences with the 5-year-old and comfort the 2-year-old. But even more important, get these kids to a counselor to find out what is going on with the older boy — and to give you some guidance and support as you work to turn things around.Both boys need you — though in different ways. Both boys count on you and the other adults in their lives to provide safety and help when they can’t help themselves.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Since I can remember I have had horrible anxiety when it came to change and social interactions. On top of that I would experience horrible mood swings, from feeling like I was a superstar to feeling so sad and hopeless I wanted to die! I have been on many different anti-depressants and anxiety drugs. I have always felt out of place and had few, if any, friends. As a kid I would fake being sick so I didn’t have to go to school, if I had to do a presentation in front of the class I would pretend I was sick or hurt to go home to get out of it, as I got older, like high school I would go hide in the rest room until that class was over so I didn’t have to be in front of the class. In my adult life I have hid in a rest room at work so I didn’t have to give out an award in front of a 100 people! I have walked off jobs because I was to scared to walk through the door. [/INST]  Anxiety has plagued you since childhood. It continues to be a problem, most likely because it has never been properly treated. You feel as though the problem has become worse over time. It seems as though it has. Avoiding or fleeing anxiety-producing situations reinforces an anxiety problem and will increase future anxiety, in most cases. It temporarily provides relief but in the long run, it makes it worse.There are very effective treatments that exist for anxiety and panic. Two of the best are (1) cognitive behavioral therapy and (2) exposure and response prevention therapy. Both are very good but they cannot work if you quit therapy prematurely.The key to overcoming anxiety is to resist the urge to flee a situation when you feel anxious. Your desire to flee a situation is understandable in the face of severe anxiety but it is this very behavior that reinforces the anxiety. Resisting this urge to flee and enduring anxiety are the only true ways to solve this problem.It is important to understand the nature of anxiety. It can increase to very high levels but it can only reach a maximum. It will eventually peak and then decrease. Part of exposure and prevention response therapy is encouraging the client to endure all of the stages of anxiety, from the most intense periods to its ultimate decrease. Exposure and prevention response therapy would essentially force you to face your fears in a systematic and controlled environment.Force yourself to attend therapy even if it makes you uncomfortable and anxious. It may be unpleasant but it is a cure. Anxiety does not have to be a crippling or lifelong problem.My suggestion is to find a therapist who specializes in treating anxiety disorders. Also consider a therapist who specializes in exposure and response prevention therapy. For those who are willing to undergo this type of therapy, the success rates are very high. A Psych Central blogger recently posted about her experience.Psychotropic medications can help to decrease your anxiety while undergoing therapy. You have tried several medications and they have not worked but that is not an uncommon beginning. You should continue to work with your prescribing physician and continue to search for one, or a combination of several, medications that will provide relief. Remember, relief is not a cure but merely a means to manage symptoms.Unfortunately, if this problem is left untreated it will very likely worsen. This is often the nature of an untreated anxiety disorder. The find help tab, at the top of this page, can help you locate a therapist in your community. I wish you the best. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve been dating this guy for 2 years. When he is “on” it is great. We are able to talk about any subject and have lots of fun and what appears to be a deep connection – we talk about serious subjects, philosophies, growth, the meaning of life, etc. It’s very engaging. This goes on for a few months and then suddenly he turns “off.” One day I wake up and we are not connecting at the “normal” pace (i.e daily phone calls, a few texts, or plans for in person contact). The connection feels severed, there is an edge in his voice, and he is cold. I notice this, give it some space (2-3 days) and then intentionally and gently bring it up. Initially he is defensive but pretty quickly he will acknowledge that yes, he’s withdrawn and eventually some narrative will show up as a reason for the behavior – he felt I disrespected him (I was late returning a call), he felt I abandoned him (I had some trips and so I was out of town), he was nervous that I’d reject some of his behavior that he’d been hiding (he smokes occasionally), etc. The conversations come back on line and we talk about his feelings, needs, and better ways to communicate etc. He does have a therapist and I suggest he work on these issues with his therapist. Then everything goes back to normal until it cycles again. [/INST] Whether or not you should stay with your partner is a very personal decision. That decision can be life altering. If you were to stay with him, the two of you may eventually consider marriage. Should you marry, you will be legally connected to him. This kind of decision requires a great deal of thought as it is one of the most important decisions you may ever make in life.You are right to be concerned. His behavior is problematic for the relationship. The proof of that is the problems it is causing. Should you decide to stay with him and he does not change, then you will have essentially agreed to accept his behavior. Are you willing to live with his behavior?You asked whether there’s anything you can do to soften the blow of his “off” experiences?” That is a difficult question to answer without knowing more about what precipitates these experiences. More information would be necessary to make that determination.If I could interview you in person, I would be interested in how long he has been in counseling and what progress has been made. It would be helpful to know more about what the therapist thinks is wrong? What happens when he shuts down? What is he thinking? Where does he go (literally) when he is like this? Does he stop talking altogether? How long has this been happening? Does he behave this way with other people? When did you notice it developing? What are the precursors to this behavior? Is he angry and hides so as to not physically harm you or is he feeling betrayed and can’t find the words to communicate his feelings? The answers to those questions, among others, will be important when determining whether or not you should move forward with this relationship.You mentioned that he has his own therapist and you see one separately (but that you’re in between therapists at the moment). Couples counseling may or may not be helpful. In any event, the fact that you both are open to counseling is a very good sign.Once you find a new therapist, he or she can assist you in exploring whether or not this relationship is right for you. You’ll want to examine your main question of what role, if any, do you play in how he behaves. He seems to be reacting to your behavior. Therapy is the ideal place to examine the dynamics of your relationship.His seems to be displaying extreme passive aggressive behavior. Passive-aggressive people are in fact aggressive in their behavior. Giving someone the “cold shoulder” is a bold expression without ever saying a word.The other problem with this type of behavior is that you never know what exactly precedes their behavior. People describe this experience as “walking on egg shells.” That expression essentially means having to be hypervigilant about what can set them off. That’s a very stressful way to live. It is impossible to communicate with someone who shuts down. Your boyfriend does eventually “come back online” but it’s important that he develop the ability to prevent his going “off” to begin with.The purpose of dating is to see if the two of you are a match. It’s an opportunity to spend time with an individual, to gauge their reactions, and get a sense of whether you want to make a more permanent commitment. If you see behavior that is concerning, then it’s time to rethink whether you want to stay in this relationship.At this point in time, it seems prudent to find a therapist and seriously examine whether or not this relationship is right for you. You need more information before deciding and a good therapist will be able to assist you in that process. Good luck with your decision. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My boyfriend of 3 months broke up with me a week ago and I’m trying to figure some things out. [/INST]  One of the many great unfairnesses of nature is that girls are often ready for relationships far earlier than boys. My guess is that your guy really likes you but isn’t as ready as you are to take the steps toward a deeper or more exclusive relationship. This has nothing to do with how his mother was as an adult. His dad should know better than to get involved on this level with his teenager’s relationships.My best suggestion to you is that you slow way, way down. Enjoy your friendship with this fellow and let that friendship deepen and mature. Do fun things together. Hang out with each other’s friends and families. Figure out what you have in common and enjoy it.Don’t talk about romance. Don’t ask him to swear his love and devotion. That stuff belongs in movies and in relationships that are much further along than yours. If this relationship is meant to be, it will unfold naturally.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been with my fiancé for 5 years, we got engaged 2 years ago. We planned a wedding and then everything fell apart. His sister told him I was cheating on him, she also spread the rumor through the family. I swore to him I didn’t and he didn’t know what to believe. I do not cheat on him. when that all started his ex who he has a daughter with started turning his daughter against me. His ex never liked me. They had their daughter after a very short time of being together, they tried to make it work for her but they didn’t get along. [/INST]  I’m afraid there isn’t much you can do about the relationship with the daughter. She is only 9. She is caught in a bind. She can’t like you because that makes her mother upset with her. She is dependent on her mom so she has to at least pretend to agree with her mother. Meanwhile, her mother can’t stand you because at one point her daughter loved you best. That may have been deserved but it doesn’t matter. She is insecure and immature. Rather than look at what needed to be changed in her own relationship with her daughter, she came up with stories that she hoped would eject you from the family.Your fiance really has to stay civil with his ex. She is the mother of his child. If he makes too big of an issue with her, she is likely to separate him from his child. That would be terrible for the little girl. The most loving and kind thing you can do for her (and for your guy) is help her maintain contact with her dad. Please don’t hate that he sees her. It’s a big statement that he is a quality guy that he makes the effort to maintain the relationship. When she is older, she is likely to see for herself what went on. It often happens. At that point, she will be able to make a separate adult relationship with you.There is nothing you can do about the women in your fiance’s family either. My guess is that his ex has let his mother know that she won’t see her grandchild if she accepts you. If so, that complicates things further. The only person who might be able to change their minds is your fiance. I hope he has made it clear that you are his choice and that you don’t deserve the treatment you got from your ex. He might be able to help them see his daughter regardless of his ex’s threats. But maybe not. If he’s done what he could, please let it go. Focus on the fact that your fiance loves you and is choosing you in spite of his family’s feelings about it. That’s huge. Make a good life with your guy. Find something meaningful to do on the evenings he’s with his daughter. And focus on how lucky the two of you are to have found each other.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Since I was a young girl, I have obeyed my parents and have rarely given them a problem. When I was a sophomore in high school, I began to restrict my food intake, and was later diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. Like many people with anorexia, I am extremely perfectionistic and try to please those around me. In high school and through the end of my junior year of college, I achieved high grades, rarely drank alcohol, and spoke to my mother daily. [/INST]  What a difficult, difficult situation. I’m impressed that your parents and you are trying so hard to come to a resolution. At this point, you have quite a committee working with you (your therapist, your friends, your mom’s therapist, the family therapist, now me).Personally, I don’t think it’s very helpful to label someone. Although your folks may act “controlling,” they do so because of many complicated issues. You probably scared them to death with the eating disorder, for example. That may have intensified their protectiveness. On top of that, you mention that they see their kids’ successes as an indication that they did well. This suggests that maybe they have some self-esteem issues and need your successes to shore up their feelings about their lives. Meanwhile, you are trying to figure out how to separate from your family as all young adults do while still maintaining loving contact and how to be with the man you love when your family disapproves. Yikes. What a lot to think about.My vote is that you stick with the family therapist to see if there is any way to allay your parents’ fears and to give you room to make your own decisions. You all may benefit from having a safe place to talk about why there is such a difference of opinion about your boyfriend. Your parents need help to understand that ultimatums and threats will drive you away from them emotionally even if you obey them. You need help learning how to assert yourself and still maintaining connection. They need help recognizing that your independence is something they can take pride in.Please tell the family therapist about the angry fallout following sessions. This should become part of what is talked about. The therapist can only do her work if she knows what is happening between sessions. I encourage you to stick with it. Putting in the effort now is really, really worth it if it means that you can maintain a good relationship with your family and yet live your own adult life.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been suffering from depression for four years and have been on medication and attending off and on therapy for about two now. I have noticed my bad days aren’t so bad now, but my good days aren’t as good either. About 9 months ago I started a new medication and have noticed a lack of appetite, sex drive, and passion for anything in general, as well as consistent nausea when I do eat, so I’ve been considering weening off of them. I have a family history of mental disorders, and have been diagnosed with Major Depression, but I’m tired of feeling numb. Do you believe discontinuing my medication would be beneficial for me? [/INST]  It could be beneficial or it could be harmful to stop taking your antidepressants. You should consider both the pros and cons before making a decision.Some of the pros might be that you would no longer experience the side effects of the medication. You may no longer feel numb. This is known as emotional blunting and it is common among certain antidepressant medications. It would be good to have your full range of emotions restored.However, a possible con is that the returning emotions might be unpleasant. One criticism of antidepressant medication is that it doesn’t treat the root of the problem. Some say that it only masks the problem. If that is true, then the problems or negative emotions that motivated you to begin antidepressant medication could return.Another consideration is that you could be feeling better because of the medicine. It’s not uncommon for people to think, “I feel better now so I no longer need the medication.” Once you stop your symptoms could return. They may not, but it’s a possible outcome.If you decide to stop your medication, it is strongly recommended that you discuss it with your prescribing physician, who can supervise the titration process. You should also attend regular psychotherapy appointments. Many people overcome depression with therapy alone.Take your time. Discuss your options with your prescribing physician and your therapist and only make a decision when you have thoroughly considered all problems and prospects. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello. So here’s the thing: I noticed I’m an attention seeker a long time ago and I cannot understand why. My childhood has not been perfect, but it has been pretty good. My parent and my friends love me. I certainly can’t complain. [/INST]  Your desire for attention and your creating situations in which you will gain attention may fall under the broad category of fictitious disorders. These disorders involve individuals pretending as though he or she has a physical or mental illness. As you can probably attest to, this causes distress in one’s life. If those around you were to learn about your feigning illnesses, they would no longer trust you and some would cut ties with you altogether.These types of disorders often stem from underlying emotional problems. Individuals with fictitious disorders wish to stop, but they often find that they can’t. It is almost like an addiction. Professional help is often required.There is nothing wrong with self-help if it works, but as you stated “I just can’t help it.” Your own self-help efforts have led to a reduction in intensity, but it remains an unresolved problem. This would suggest professional help is necessary.The fear of shame or embarrassment can hinder individuals from beginning therapy just as the fear of the boogey man can stop people from opening their closet door. But there is no boogey man in the closet just as there is no shame or embarrassment in therapy.The fear of therapy stems from the false belief that you are supposed to know how to fix your own problems and that there is something wrong with you if you need therapy. Unfortunately, those sorts of stubborn and false ideas prevent many people with resolvable mental health problems from seeking help.There’s no reason to fear therapy. I hope you will consider it. It would help you to feel better. Please take care. </s>"

I hate it here. but i have two kids (6 and 9) and have been married 12 years. My marriage sucks. I can’t stand my husband. Everything he does agitates me. We fight all the time. We have no money and it seems to get worse everyday. I wouldn’t be surprised if i lost my house one day very soon. [/INST]  There’s an old saying: “Wherever you run, there you are.” I don’t know if there are more opportunities in Chicago than in Texas. I do suspect there is a wounded child inside of you who wants to go home for the comfort of having family nearby. Of course, once they give you a hug and s hot meal, you still won’t have a job. You’ll still be having conflicts with your husband. And your kids may well be angry with you for pulling them away from the only home they knew and their friends. A move might be wise but it shouldn’t be done just because you think there is a geographical cure for all that is wrong.The job market for teachers is your area is reportedly very tight. I don’t blame you a bit if you are hurt and angry that your profession has been taken away from you for now. I know it’s hard to keep it in perspective, but budget cuts and layoffs are not your fault. Fortunately, as a teacher, you do have lots of skills that can be redirected to other jobs. I think you need a career counselor to help you explore alternatives beyond those you’ve already thought about. When I did a web search for career counselors in Houston, I came up with pages and pages of possibilities. Do take a look.Meanwhile, don’t underestimate the stress that being short on cash and long on disappointment can have on a marriage. Perhaps you and your husband would be fighting anyway. But it’s possible that you two are taking your financial and job stress out on each other. If that’s the case, you need help to get back on the same team, working on the problems, instead of on different teams tearing each other down. A few sessions with a minister or a counselor might help you remember why you married each other and could help you find ways to be mutually supportive. You might even both decide that a move to where there is a family support system isn’t such a bad idea. I have no way of knowing if that’s true. But two intelligent adults should be able to figure it out if they can start addressing the problem head on instead of sitting in anger.I think you made an important step in writing to us here at PsychCentral. Instead of just throwing in the towel, you reached out for a little help. Now consider whether there is enough good in your marriage to work on it. If so, call a truce and start working on concrete steps for managing your present and planning for your future.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve been depressed for years, I was bullied through school mentally (I was violent as revenge sometimes) and never really had friends and I am an only child with a working mom and step dad so I spend a lot of time alone and I see a therapist but its not getting better. I’m in college, 2nd yr, have no social or love life, and even though I go to church with family I spend a lot of time home alone obsessed with shootings, killers, and massacres, and I have homicidal thoughts about killing people uncontrollably. I also have a problem with telling lies without even thinking but I can’t stop telling the lies. Lately I’m very irritable, not enjoying anything or laughing, and I think about doing dangerous things to a vast amount of people I hate but I know I probably won’t cause of consequences. I have tried talking to my parents (I didn’t tell them all these details) but they just brush it off or think I’m just worrying or a crazy young person and they wont help me see a doctor, so I’m turning here for help. Thank You [/INST]  You’re doing the right thing by asking for advice. It was also very wise of you to begin therapy but it doesn’t seem to bring you the help that you were expecting. You haven’t provide much information about your therapy, but I wonder if part of the problem might be that you have not been forthcoming about all that is wrong. Have you discussed these issues in full detail with your therapist? Is your therapist aware of your obsession with mass shooters and killers and your homicidal thoughts? If not, then it may be difficult for your therapist to help you if he or she isn’t aware of the scope of the problem. It’s always important to be honest with your therapist.Maybe you have been honest with your therapist but the therapy is still not working for you. In that case, you should find another therapist. Always choose a therapist with whom you feel you have a connection and one who you feel is competent. That therapist will be in the best position to help you.If your parents won’t help you in finding a psychiatrist, then perhaps your therapist might be able to help. He or she could refer you to a psychiatrist. You might also try contacting your college counseling center. The staff may be able to refer you to a psychiatrist. Many college counseling centers have psychiatrists “in-house” and you may be able to have an evaluation done quickly. Medication could significantly improve your symptoms, especially your depression and irritability.Because you have admitted to having homicidal thoughts, you should avoid all materials related to mass shootings and killers. Don’t allow yourself to indulge in these materials. Try to surround yourself with healthy and positive people and reading materials. Given your state of mind, nothing good would come from you reading about horrific crimes.Finally, I commend you on your decision to seek psychological help. As you may have learned from your readings about mass shooters and killers, many had depression but they chose not to seek help. They were irresponsible in their decision. Had they sought professional help when it was clearly needed they might never have engaged in acts of evil. Seeking help is a very responsible choice, and you should be commended for doing so. If you feel that you might harm someone or yourself, don’t hesitate to go to the hospital. The staff can protect you from doing something that you would later regret. Please take care. </s>"

This really confuses me cause in my head I don’t sound anything like that and I consciously try very hard not to but my efforts seem to be in vain. I have now come to the conclusion that I might not have a right definition for the terms therefore I do not recognized when I sound like that. Its not at all my intention to do so and it’s really frustrating cause I feel like what I actually wanna say and what it comes out gets lost in translation from my thoughts to my speech. [/INST] I understand why you are frustrated. Give yourself credit for wanting to respond to your friends’ feedback even though it was probably difficult to hear.I suggest a couple of things: First, do check with other friends to see if they agree that you sound patronizing. It’s just possible that the two friends who talked to you are particularly sensitive to tone of voice and that others don’t agree.If most of your friends and family generally agree that you do sound condescending, choose someone you especially trust and ask them to imitate what they hear when you speak to them so you can better understand what they are talking about. Then role play different ways to say the same thing until you both agree that you have found a correction. Practice will bring how you speak in line with what you intend to say.I wish you well.  </s>"

I was bullied as a child and in my teenage years and that is giving me a lot of problems. [/INST]  You seem to be biased towards believing that people are “out to get you.” Biases involve prejudgment, which is making a judgement prematurely. This significantly increases the likelihood of coming to the wrong conclusions. The good news is that if you are aware of your bias, you can correct it.Some people would describe their worldview as pessimistic or optimistic. That means they filter the world through a certain lens. A pessimist expects the worst. An optimist expects the best. Both are inaccurate ways to view the world. One should never be an optimist or pessimist. One sees the world as falsely better than it is in reality, and the other sees it as being worse than it is in reality. One should only be a realist, seeing the world as it is, never better or worse.It’s good that you are in treatment. A decrease in your blood pressure levels might indicate that your treatment is working. You should continue with your treatment and begin counseling if you have not tried it already. Counseling will help you to more accurately judge situations and the intentions of other people.One should strive to adapt their attitudes and beliefs according to the reality of a situation. Therapy is the ideal place to correct your biases and reactions to people and circumstances. Please take care. </s>"

"<s>[INST] I rented out a beautiful flat, but the moment I moved in I started feeling that my sister in law (husband’s brother’s wife) will be jealous and she might also buy flat in same society. She has copied me several times before, but never gives credit and many times people see things at her place first and then think it is me who has copied her. This time, I have this fear from the last 4 months that she will buy flat in the place where I am currently renting so that when we move out they can come in. And I won’t be able to tolerate that as they will come to know about this flat through me, but I will never be acknowledged for that and secondly, everyone else in the family will praise them that they bought the flat here (no one will remember that we rented here first and through us they came to know of this place) and thirdly, they will become superior to me and they will flourish more as there are lots of opportunities and facilities in this society. Because of this fear, I am not inviting anyone home, especially my inlaws and secondly I am planning to move out to other society before I invite anyone here.

"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I’ve been having delusions for a long time that people can read my thoughts, and there are cameras everywhere watching me, and that everyone on the street is reporting on me. The problem is, I know these are false so I’m not sure if these are actually delusions. They’re not constant, only there most of the time, but because I have some moments without them I have insight into the fact that they are not true. Some separate rational part of my brain knows they’re not true, even when I’m actively believing them. [/INST]  I’m sure this is very upsetting. I can’t responsibly answer your question with a yes or no. People are complicated and individual in their responses to what seem to be the same issues.The best thing you can do to get the answers you are looking for — and to have some peace of mind — is to make an appointment with a licensed mental health counselor. A counselor will ask you questions to get more details about your experiences and to make a diagnosis. But it doesn’t stop there. You will also be given suggestions about what to do to manage those upsetting thoughts. Then it’s up to you whether you want to pursue therapy.I hope you will make that appointment. You’ve already lived with your concerns quite long enough.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I hate to be seen in public, I am very self conscious. I always feel like I am fat. I always think of worst case scenarios, for example, my husband will leave to go to the store and I’ll worry that he’ll get in car accident. I worry a lot that my children will hate me when their older. When ever someone asks me for advice I am always negative. I get angry over nothing. I hate it. Anything will set me off such as just having to repeat myself will make me extremely upset. I have a hard time falling asleep at night because I am afraid someone will brake in and kill me while I’m sleeping. I will think about a situation over and over in my head and I have to tell my self constantly to stop thinking about it because I get so upset mostly thinking that I looked like an idiot. [/INST]  What a hard, hard way to live. I hope this response will encourage you to get the help you need. No one should have to cope with this kind of pain day in and day out.From the information you included, I do think you have an anxiety disorder. I don’t know why the counselor rejected that idea so quickly. Perhaps she didn’t understand the level of your distress. Perhaps your anxiety prevented you from sharing enough information. Whatever the case, please, please don’t give up on all therapists because of your negative experience with one. Therapists are just like other people: They come with different personalities, different training, and different experience.You were probably right to quit treatment at the time. You and the therapist were not on the same page about your diagnosis or your treatment. If you were paying for a 50 minute hour, you deserved 50 minutes of focused treatment. But that negative experience doesn’t mean that you don’t need treatment. You do.Please do make an appointment with another counselor. If you could take care of the problems, you would have done so already. Take your letter and this response with you to the first appointment. You did a fine job laying out the problems. Reading it may help the new counselor understand the extent of your pain.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] So, I don’t know where to begin… To sum up, I didn’t try hard enough in my last year of high school because I didn’t want to go into university since I didn’t know what I would do. I should have just sucked it up and tried my best. I am in a college right now and failed all my classes because I didn’t try and now am on probation. I just feel that I don’t have a goal to what I’m studying for. I’m unmotivated. [/INST]  I don’t think you are unmotivated. And I don’t think you shouldn’t have gotten the job. I do think it would have been better if you’d been straight with your folks but that’s water under the bridge at this point. I think you weren’t ready for more school and didn’t know how to say so or felt that you didn’t really have a choice.I’m sorry that high school students aren’t given more support for taking a year or two off between high school and college. Your story is all too common. Colleges are now focusing on “retention” because they lose so many students after the first year. Better to take a couple of years to determine what you are going to school for rather than just going to school. You will get far more for your time and your money if you have a direction.There is no shame in taking a year or so to work, to travel, or to participate in a gap year program. You can find a list of alternatives in this article.You’re right. The retail store was a good break and a positive learning experience. I don’t think you should quit a paying job for the summer. I do think you need to be more directed in what to do next. Learn from your mistakes and make time over the next few months to explore your options and to make a clear decision about your next year.Don’t go to school only because you don’t know what else to do or because of what other people think. Instead, figure out how to try out various professions that interest you or immerse yourself in a different culture. Take a class or two, either for credit or not. (Did you know there are free online classes available in just about anything? See MIT’s online offerings. Or look into Coursera.) More experiences and more exploration will make it clear what kind of school you should go to and what you might want to pursue as a major.You do owe your parents a bigtime apology. I suspect they are more upset that you lied to them than that you weren’t ready for college. Make amends as best you can and engage them in a discussion about a reasonable plan for the next year or two.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  I do not really know where to start. The past three years of my life have been a hell not to mention a blur. I have been diagnosed with sevral disorders, and I am aware that my bi polar disorder can explain my rapid mood swings, but what is happening now is out of hand. For the past month, I might even maybe 2 months I have had these day long events. Starts out normal enough and the day is going fine and then bang I’m angry and not like ‘Oh I’m angry, I’ll get over it, it’s more the anger where your hands shake and your fgriends turn into your worst enemies. I wanna break things and acts of voilence have corssed my mind more then once. I have been verbal all my life so argueing and being hurtful with my word is nothiong new but wanting to take it to the next level and feeling that loss of control is scaring me to death. Ive had fits of rage that turn into a crying session pulled out some of my hair in furstration. there is the other side of that spectrum as well…the depression…crying for hours on end and afriad of everything thats in my life..fearing my self above all. I dont understand why this is happeneing what might have caused it or even exactly what it is. I have been dealing with bipolar, adhd, borderline personality disorder and depression since I was a child. I have never dealt with anything like this and I need some insight. Please help. [/INST] My sense of the situation is that your symptoms are not under control. You said that you have bipolar disorder as well as a few other disorders but you did not say whether you are taking medication or are in treatment.You asked about what could account for your increase in anger. There could be a number of possible explanations. A change in medication could explain a shift in mood. This might include a decrease in medication, an increase, or a change to other medications. As I mentioned above, you did not indicate whether you are taking medications but if you are, this is one area to explore. A change in your medicine could affect your mood.Was there a change in your life? This is one possibility to explore. Think about what, if anything has changed recently in your life. This could account for mood shifts.Other possible reasons to explain a change in your mood may include lack of sleep and using drugs or alcohol. A lack of sleep can cause irritability. For instance, if you are used to getting seven or eight hours of sleep and you are now getting less, then you should expect to see a change in your mood. It is difficult to manage your emotions when you’re tired.Without more detailed information it is difficult to know why you are experiencing anger outbursts. If you would like to write back and provide information related to whether there has been a change in any of the aforementioned areas discussed above, I’d be happy to try to provide you with a more specific answer. Without that information, I can only give you a general answer. I would suggest that you meet with a mental health professional, if you are not already in treatment. You should also be evaluated by a psychiatrist to determine whether medication is necessary or if a medication change would be helpful.

"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I’ve seen tons of therapists, I talk about my abuse all the time to friends and my girlfriend. I know it was horrible and traumatizing but I feel like I’ve come to terms with it, but I’m still terrified of my parents. I have nightmares that they find me or I’m stuck in their house with them again or they are chasing me and I have to run away from them and hide. I have nightmares about one or both of them every single night. I feel like I’ll never be free of them. Even my psychologist ran out of ideas on how to stop these recurring nightmares. [/INST]  It sounds like you’ve already done a great deal of recovery work. It must be discouraging to feel so stuck with terrifying memories. I do have a few suggestions:First, I question whether talking about the abuse all the time is healthy for you. It keeps the bad memories front and center in your mind. I suggest you try focusing on and talking about something different for a few weeks to see what happens. There is research that people feel better when they spend the last few minutes of every day writing down at least 3 things they are grateful for. Those things can be big or small. If you can’t think of anything major, focus on how grateful you are to have running water or to have had lunch that day. Big things can include your good fortune to have your girlfriend and friends in your life as well as for other specific things that happen. Then talk about those things when you talk to your friends.Second: Talk to your therapist about getting a second opinion. Even the best therapists sometimes run out of ideas. That doesn’t mean that there aren’t other good ideas out there. You may need to talk to another therapist or two or three. They will bring their own ideas to the situation.Finally: If you were seeing me, I’d suggest that we try some hypnosis to see if that would be helpful. I would help you learn some self-hypnosis so that you would have another tool to help yourself. Do talk to your therapist about whether that is advisable in your case.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] First of all, I come from a loving family where my parents have a good marriage. My dad is a very hard worker and both parents were very involved in my life. I am an only child. My mother (though very loving) is bipolar (I think it would now be called cyclothymic disorder b/c she doesn’t have depressed episodes) and I always had to be a very strong and self-reliant person growing up. She did yell a lot. I find now that I end up being emotionally exhausted in relationships because 1. I am 100% committed to persevere despite all obstacles in anything I do and 2. I end up with guys that take a lot out of me emotionally. [/INST]  Thank you for your clear and well-thought-out concerns. The fact that you have noticed both your patterns and his is a very good observation. It is only when we can see our patterns and others that we have a real chance of making changes.The 3-week separation is the right thing to do. I have written articles about this elsewhere. The only way true change takes place is by first stopping what isn’t working. By you recognizing how depleting your boyfriend and other relationships have been, you are taking the lead by stopping the most essential problem: trying to persevere.The sabotage cycle your boyfriend has, pulling the plug right when things are good, is often a cycle that happens when there has been the type of dysfunction you identified in his family. I think it is interesting you have noticed this and identified it as a cycle because in some way it may be like your relationship with your mother. Your experience has been with a mother who required you to be resilient and the one taking responsibility. For you to heal the wounds from your family, and for him to heal his, couples therapy would be the way to go. To be honest it sounds like the two of you are close because there is such clarity on what the issue is, but this will not get better on its own. I suggest using the find help tab at the top of the page to locate a couples therapist. If that isn’t possible, check out a couples therapy weekend with skilled therapists. This may help you both find the correction and the love you both desire.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: I wake up, I’m fine, someone does literally anything that I don’t agree with or approve of then I get angry as hell. Like for example, I’m unpacking my lunchbox and I got warm fruit cups that I want to put in the fridge, my mother is closest to the fridge so I ask her to take care of it, she says no. That is infuriating, like I have all these people who just f’in lie and s–t like its some sort of game. [/INST]  I believe you that you are intelligent and talented. But it takes more than a high IQ to get along with others. One also needs a high emotional intelligence and a well developed ability to look beyond our own needs and wants to see a larger picture.I don’t know, of course, if your mom was setting out to aggravate you. But I do suggest that she may have had something more important on her mind than your fruit cups. Did you take a moment to figure out if she was busy or preoccupied with something?You miss the point entirely about your superior officer, who is truly your superior in rank. His job is not to see your individuality. His job is to get everyone in the group to conform and to obey orders, no argument. In battle, should it ever come to that (and I sincerely hope it never does), it is not safe for the patrol if someone like you starts questioning the officer in charge. So — it’s not about who is right about the regulation. His comment is an attempt to get you to accept that he is in charge and you are not. If you can’t accept that, you would be a danger to your comrades.I’m not trying to make excuses for other people. I wasn’t there. I am trying to help you consider that other people’s feelings, motives and agendas may simply be different from yours, not wrong. This is what makes human relationships so complicated.The one thing you are very right about is the uselessness of all this anger. I hope you will consider talking with a therapist. I do think therapy will be a challenge for you. To go well, you will need to take in feedback and make some changes in your own perspectives — a tall order for you who wants the world to change instead. I hope you will take this seriously. Otherwise you could end up feeling very right but also very lonely.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have had this problem for the majority of life where it began with a suicidal depression at the age of 9. I no longer have strong impulses to commit suicide, although these visual thoughts and impulses has changed into hurting or even killing others. I am a visual thinker, which I guess is why these thoughts seems so lifelike. These thoughts also come very sudden, and are related to the present situation I am in. I am right now in a relationship with my girlfriend and we have a child (2 years old) and two cats. I have had previous thoughts of harming my girlfriend, which is usual to me since I get these thoughts often towards other humans. On the other hand it started bothering me when I got very strong, visual impulses to hurt our infant child. I got real reason to worry since I have never been good to remember any dreams, but the last two or three I can remember involves harming or killing our daughter, which is very distressfull. Sometimes these impulses can be very hard to handle, which is the reason why I chose to register on this website. We got a new kitten the other day, and even that she is in a new location, she has adapted very well. But due to something as simple as her not wanting a cuddle drove both thoughts and action to treat her very aggressively and rough. Stopping myself from harming it, I had to sit alone in 15 minutes to calm myself down. I am concerned that if I can’t control my impulses to something as innocent as a kitten, what can happen in the future towards my daughter? Thanks for helping. [/INST]  It’s encouraging that you have decided to take a proactive approach to solving this problem. It significantly increases the likelihood of a satisfactory resolution.The way you describe your thoughts implies that they are not within your control. You can, however, control your reaction to them.It’s unusual to experience suicidal depression at such a young age. You didn’t include the reason why you felt suicidal at nine years old, but it could have been the result of trauma or a difficult childhood. No one, especially children, naturally feels suicidal. Something must have happened to have caused those feelings.I would recommend therapy. Therapy could help you to understand why you have these current problems and where they originated. They are probably connected to your early childhood experiences. Exploring these possibilities might be necessary in order to correct this problem.Should you decide to pursue therapy, consider choosing a therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders. It is not uncommon for people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a type of anxiety disorder, to have intrusive and distressing thoughts about wanting to hurt or kill people. You might also consult a psychiatrist to determine if medication could help.This is not a problem that you should ignore. Currently, you are able to control your reaction to these thoughts and to not act on them but that could change. You must do whatever is necessary to ensure that you never act on these thoughts. One way to do that is to seek help from mental health professionals. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi my name is —–. I have suffered from severe depression. Or at least I think it’s severe. I have told my mom about it and asked for therapy however they told me that they do not believe in therapy and that it is all in my head and if I think happy thoughts the depression will go away. Also that if I pray to God that he will take it away. I do not know what to do I want to get better I want these thoughts go away I can only see that happening if I see a professional therapist or whatever what should I do? I want to be happy, I feel as if my parents are disappointed in me for having this, I just what I want this to be gone, I need help… [/INST]  I’m sorry about your situation. Depression is a very real disorder. It is estimated that globally, depression affects more than 350 million people. The good news is that it is a highly treatable condition.It was wise to ask for help. Professional mental health treatment is the primary way in which depression is treated. Unfortunately, your parents don’t believe in professional treatment. Apparently, they believe it appropriate to rely on faith to heal psychological ailments.Religion and prayer are associated with positive emotional health; however, they are not evidence-based treatments for mental health conditions. Faith helps many people cope with stress but this alone is not enough. Faith works best as an adjunct to evidence-based mental health treatment; it is not recommended as the sole form of treatment for mental health problems.You may want to revisit this issue with your parents, if you feel that they might reconsider their stance regarding your seeking professional treatment. If not, another option would be to speak to the guidance counselor or another trusted faculty member at your school. They might be able to convince your parents that treatment is the best way to deal with depression.Your letter indicated that you are nearly 18 years old. You will soon be an adult and can pursue treatment independent of your parents. College, if you will be attending, may also provide you an opportunity to seek treatment. Most colleges offer free counseling services to registered students. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] current_problem: From the U.S: I’m 14. My parents control every part of my life and sometimes use physical force.

[/INST]  You are not being a big baby. From what you wrote, I don’t see that you are a bad daughter so much as a normal 14-year-old who is beginning to want more independence.Let me be perfectly clear: Parents do not have the right to beat their children — ever. They do have the right to be unreasonable and to set rules you don’t like. But they don’t have the right to hit you and to make you so scared of them that you are having anxiety.Please talk to your school nurse or school counselor or a teacher or another adult you trust about what is going on.

"<s>[INST] I don’t feel a motherly connection to my mom. I would feel more comfortable talking and leaning on just a woman her age rather than her. She wasn’t a BAD mom as I grew up. I always had what i needed pretty much. But she would scream and threaten me almost everyday. Everyday we would fight. She has slammed me against the wall, smacked me in the face, threw me around, kicked me while I was down, pulled my hair, hit me with a belt, embarrassed me in front of family, friends, and in public, squeezed my face really hard, completely invaded my privacy…ect. A lot of physical stuff. I know i was difficult growing up but I know why she had to put her hands on me. I used to hate her sometimes. [/INST]  What do you mean, “she wan’t a bad mother”? Yes, she very much was. What you are describing is child abuse. No one has the right to physically and verbally abuse a kid – ever! And you go on to say that she doesn’t continue to do that stuff only because she knows you would fight back. Do you mean if you were smaller and weaker, you think the abuse would continue? That the only reason you’re safe now is that you are big enough to take care of yourself?There is something very wrong with your mother, not you. You didn’t get the safe and loving mother every child deserves.That little kid inside is still craving a mom. You question is why you can’t be attached to your biological mother. The answer is simple: The survivor in you knows better! To attach to your biological mother would probably only invite more abuse.If your sexual orientation is toward other women, that’s to be respected. But if the reason you seek out women is to comfort the aching child you still hold inside, it’s unfair to your partners. Sadly, a romantic relationship based on your neediness isn’t likely to be healthy. Although it’s true that in any good relationship one partner or the other can provide comfort and care for the other now and then, if it is too one-sided the relationship usually collapses.Instead, you need a close older friend or two to be close to, not a sexual romantic partner. There are such women, you know — women who miss their own daughters, women who never had a daughter, and women who include younger women in their circle of friends because they enjoy their energy, enthusiasm and new ideas. Friendships like that include good talks, sharing experiences, hanging out and, yes, some hugs and affection. You can have that without “dating.”So – if you need a mother, not a lover, start going to places where you can get to know mother-types. Look around. I’m sure there are clubs and organizations and causes in your area that attract feisty, energetic, interesting, fun-loving women who are a generation older. Join up and get involved. The friendships will evolve naturally.If your heart is still aching and breaking that you can’t make your mother be who you needed and want her to be, please do consider some therapy. You aren’t going to change your mother. You can heal the inner wounds she caused you.I wish you well.  </s>"

You quickly, within one minute and despite your tiredness, recognized the error of your ways. You then sought to correct your error and did so. You felt guilty, apologized and made it right.

When people are tired, they are not always at their best. They lack energy and clarity of mind. They might say or do things that they normally would not say or do. That’s because they are tired; not because they are bad people. It happens to all of us.What happened was perfectly understandable and forgivable. It’s human to make mistakes.

"<s>[INST] I have a serious issue with self motivation. I cannot seem to force myself to do anything I don’t have the urge to do ie: housework. I am wondering if my past can affect me in this way. I grew up in a home where my brother abused me and my 2 sisters mentally, physically and sexually until my parents found out when I was 9 and they subsequently divorced. I have zero memories until age 16, but I am told I was mostly beaten and intentionally scared. I am told my mother put me in counseling after she found out but I wouldn’t participate. I also went through a period of 6 months when my soon to be husband was abusive but he got therapy and we did a group therapy “dealing with emotions” course together and we have been happily married for 11 years now. I do have some issues with anxiety and fears and insomnia. I have had depression in the past (I haven’t been depressed in 2 years but was depressed a lot before that). Could this be the cause of my self motivation problem? And is self motivation something that can be helped through therapy? [/INST] A: It’s hard to say if your past history of abuse is contributing to the self motivation issue, but it certainly could be. I’m wondering if there are other areas of your life you feel that it’s a problem. I’d say most of us find it difficult to motivate ourselves to do things like housework ;) It’s easiest to procrastinate about things we don’t particularly enjoy or we find monotonous. However, issues with motivation could also be a symptom of depression, although a less obvious one. Since you have struggled with depression in the past, this symptom could be a lingering issue, as well as the insomnia.Considering the extent of abuse that you reportedly experienced and that you weren’t ready for therapy as a child/teen, I think it would be a great time to revisit it. The fact that you have blocked out many of the memories, doesn’t mean that the experiences haven’t affected you.  Sometimes the effects of abuse are so ingrained that they really seem more like part of our personality than an actual symptom, such as feeling “not good enough,” excessive guilt, perfectionism, and so forth. Furthermore, your anxiety and insomnia could be related to the abuse you experience as well, as a partial PTSD reaction.Even if your issues with motivation are not related to the abuse or to depression, I still think therapy would be helpful, especially a therapist trained in Cognitive-Behavioral treatments or EM </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am a 32 year old single female. I have recently re-connected with a man I knew in High School. I had a crush on him then and have met with him casually and have feelings for him now. My radar went up when he mentioned that he can’t remember the past with any feelings or emotions. I thought that this was a very strange thing to say. I will admit I have my guard up because in the past I have been attracted to men who have mental problems. My last serious relationship ended when I found out that my boyfriend was stealing from my parents to pay for prescription drugs over the internet. He came from a traumatic broken home an family life. [/INST]  Good for you for taking care of yourself by asking the question. It shows that you are trying to learn from your mistakes and do things differently this time. That’s an important phase of making an essential change.Memory of emotions is important. Feelings associated with memory serve as guideposts for our lives. They help us remember what kinds of things we want to repeat and what kinds of things we want to avoid. In troubled times, pleasant memories remind us that life isn’t always hard. Feelings help regulate our behavior and connect with other people.There are a number of reasons a man might say he has no emotional memory. It may simply be that, as a man, he has been taught not to express his emotions. It’s sad but true that there are still families that shut down a little boy’s emotional experience of the world, believing that to be sensitive to feelings is “unmanly.” Or he may actually have emotional memory but doesn’t recognize it as such or doesn’t have a vocabulary for it. And one of the characteristics of post-traumatic stress disorder can be dissociation from feelings. During a traumatic experience, a person may separate from feelings in order to survive what would have been overwhelming emotional pain. He also could have a personality disorder. People with antisocial personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder are sometimes disconnected from their feelings.I don’t have enough information to narrow it down for you. The simplest way for you to get an answer to your question is to simply ask him what he meant. If you are both interested in pursuing a relationship, it should be okay to explore something this important.I wish you well.  </s>"

You need to believe what your own wise inner self is telling you. This guy may be wonderful in many ways but he is in no shape to give you what you want in a relationship. He has major healing to do. On top of that, you say he is racist and addicted to media. Those are two more good reasons why he isn’t the guy for you.Meanwhile, you have issues of your own.

It’s unlikely you are going to find someone for whom you are the first and only. That doesn’t mean you can’t find someone to love you deeply and exclusively. It does mean that you need to stop competing with your own imaginary ideas about a person’s past.I hope you will make an appointment to see a counselor. You do deserve to find love. You do deserve to have less anxiety about attachment.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Since I can remember, I have had an awful relationship with my mother. I have never really felt love from her, only resentment. I think it May have something to do with the fact that she hates my father for no reason. Anyway in all my adult relationships I have not been able to connect to the other person emotionally. I’ve never seen my mom be a nurturing or caring person and I fear that I have not been able to establish lasting relationships because honestly I don’t know HOW to care for another person. I don’t know HOW to nurture and make people feel like they matter to me. I also have two beautiful children who I don’t want to feel like I don’t care about them because I truly love them with all my heart. so my question to you is am I always going to be disconnected in relationships because of the relationship I have with my mom? or is there someway I can learn to be a more nurturing person? [/INST]  I’m so glad you wrote. You deserve better. Your children deserve to have the mother you didn’t. You know the expression “It’s never too late to have a happy childhood”? Well, it’s true. We are not doomed by our upbringing. We are not programmed to repeat our own negative experiences. One of the most important messages of the positive psychology movement is that we can change how we think and we can learn new ways to inject positivity into our lives.You need a “nurturance transplant.” You need to replace that part of you that feels like a motherless and neglected child with the core of self-worth we are all born with. This article might help you understand your situation a bit better.Therapy can help you learn how to nurture yourself and others. Your therapist can help you identify and take in other sources of nurturance and love that are available right now. The more you take in, the more you will be able to give out. The more you give out, the more will come to you. But you need a jumpstart. That’s what therapy is for.Meanwhile, start treating yourself the way you wish your mother had treated you. Take good care of yourself. Treat yourself with warmth and understanding. Take care of your body and take time every day to think hard about all the positive things in your life. You might find inspiration in Kristin Neff’s book, “Self Compassion.”I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve been in 5 relationships and I’m currently in one, we’ve only been dating for about a month and I’ve gotten really depressed, I’ve stopped liking things I used to like and I feel no motivation to get up in the morning and I’m so tired all the time. I went from so happy with this guy to absolutely dreading the mention of his name, I don’t want to see him anymore and every time he talks to me or texts me I feel nauseous. I don’t understand why I have developed a hatred towards him when a couple of weeks ago I couldn’t stop talking about him. This isn’t the first time this has happened. The last three relationships I was pretty much obsessed with these guys and then like a flip of a switch I become depressed and I developed a hatred towards them. However, once I break up with them it’s like nothing ever happened and I instantly feel refreshed and back to normal. [/INST] I know very little about your personal situation so I can only speculate. New relationships are often exciting but that excitement can wear off. In the beginning, you hardly know each other. Perhaps the more you learn about the individual, the less you like about them. In that way, it could be that you’re choosing the wrong people.It’s also possible that you’re not ready for a relationship. The teenage years are a turbulent time. It’s a time of self-exploration, and so forth. It may be better to avoid dating until you gain a deeper understanding of the type of person you might like.Because you’re describing a repetitive pattern to your behavior, you should consider counseling. You also mentioned feeling depressed in relationships and that is not the norm. A therapist would be in the best position to answer your relationship questions. Give it a try. Good luck and please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My father has always had issues with drugs, drinking, and anger issues. All three together are just toxic. He is fine, fine, fine – for weeks/months – then will decide he doesn’t need his meds (for his anger problems) and go off them. Within a day, he is a raging lunatic. Screaming, yelling, hitting my mother, breaking doors, snapping his cell phone in half, kicking the dogs. Recently he started cheating on my mother as well, he keeps denying it even though he has been caught. He is driving while extremely drunk, ignoring all calls, and coming home from work 5-6 hours late. [/INST]  Your mental health is more important than anything. Living in that kind of chaos and fear won’t serve you well. Don’t defer your moving out. Start the process of looking for solutions rather than tolerating the abuse. I recommend talking to financial aid at your university — asking about housing (both on and off campus) — and speaking to the counseling center (and the women’s center in your county.) There may be resources to help you with finances, living arrangements and therapy as you transition out of your house — and into your independence.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My partner and I have been together for 6 years now, we have had a good relationship. We have a house together and we have plans for the future. A year ago he agreed to let a friend of his move in with us temporarily because he was injured and could not work. This was only supposed to be for a few months. In the first months with us he lived on welfare and was a slob. I was patient and once he was able to get a job the three of us agreed he was going to pay a modest rent every month. He lost his job shortly afterwards and continued to live with us for basically free for some time until he finally found more work. By that time he owed us quite a bit of money in bills. He would spend his money on booze and video games instead of paying his share of the bills and never put a lot of effort to finding a good job he could support himself on. I started getting fed up a few months ago and discussed with my spouse several times that his friend needs to smarten up or leave. Every time my spouse would confront his friend about money he owes us or his playing video games all day, he would make stupid excuses or claim that he was trying. He would also try to bring up things I was supposedly doing wrong instead of just admitting he’s done anything wrong himself. I believe he is manipulative and lazy and is just trying to continue to not have any responsibility and get a free ride. He accused me of trying to starve him out recently. [/INST]  What a disappointment your partner must be to you at this point. You’re right that the problem is not with the moocher who is living off you. Your problem is in your relationship. The fact that you are worried that if you leave, your boyfriend won’t work to get you back is a huge red flag. Your instincts are that he cares more about the relationship with his friend than he does about your feelings. Either that, or he is so afraid of conflict with anyone except you that he can’t bring himself to deal with the so-called friend who is using you both.From what you’ve said, you’ve been more than generous in your efforts to help a friend. After over a year of tolerating his behavior, it’s way past time for him to move on – either to be on his own or to go to his family or another friend. You’ve done more than enough. Chances are you will never see what he owes you. It is one of those hard lessons about why boundaries and written contracts are important when loaning other people money.I suggest you sit your spouse down and tell him clearly that you’re done. If he won’t hear you, there is one other option besides immediately moving out. You can tell him that if he won’t go to a couples counselor to sort things out, you will see a lawyer about how to separate amicably. A couples counselor may be able to help you two figure out what went so wrong and how to reclaim your relationship. If you still love him, it’s at least worth a try.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Plz help. Ok so some times I hear people whistling but no ones there and I see a man in the clauset and I see people moving around in mirrors but no one is outside the mirror. I also see black little dots floating in the air at night. Another thing Is that I have wierd thoughts and I have a hard time remembering if my memories really exist or not. My mood is really wierd too. Like, I’ll be extremly happy and out going then in a couple of hours depressed and then parinoid and shy which changes back to hyper and happy. I always feel like people talk about me and hav had suicidal thouts before. Plz help me because I’ve tried talking to my family but they won’t listen! [/INST]  I would suggest talking to the school guidance counselor or another trusted member of the faculty. Describe your symptoms. In addition, discuss the fact the you have brought your concerns to your parents but they have been nonresponsive. The guidance counselor can either speak to your parents on your behalf or advise you about how to approach them.If what you are experiencing is normal, then you have no problem. If what you are experiencing is not normal then you have a problem. No problem should be ignored. Most will respond best to immediate treatment. The issue here is whether or not you have a problem and if so what the problem is. Parents sometimes minimize their child’s problems because they are worried and hope that the problem will simply go away. Sometimes it does but for the sake of safety no problem should be ignored.An alternative way to approach this situation may be to suggest that your parents take you to your primary care physician (PCP). You can say something like “Mom, I’m having a tough time lately and I would feel much better if I had the opportunity to report my symptoms to a doctor. Let’s let the doctor decided if I have a problem or not.”During the appointment, report your symptoms to the doctor. He or she will likely want to investigate your symptoms further. The doctor will also want to involve your parents.The purpose of this approach is twofold: it allows you to be evaluated by a physician and secondly, the doctor can serve as an advocate for treatment. If the doctor is concerned about your symptoms, then this increases the likelihood that your parents will take you seriously.I hope this helps. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: To preface this post, I suffer from anxiety and (I think) OCD as I’m constantly worrying/thinking about my actions or health. I’m not taking any medication, nor am I seeing a counselor; I am fighting these thoughts/feelings alone. [/INST]  No, I don’t think you’re a pedophile or crazy. You stopped yourself from acting on your impulses. You feel terrible that you even had the thoughts. But I do think you have significant OCD.Most people are familiar with the most common manifestations of OCD like checking, ordering, and excessive cleaning. Less common is the kind of over-thinking you are reporting. That’s what the “obsession” in obsessive-compulsive disorder is all about.The first question I asked myself when I read your letter was, “Why is this guy trying so hard to handle this on his own?” There is no need to suffer like this. There are effective medications and talk therapy approaches that can help you master your thoughts and live more comfortably.I strongly urge you to seek out a mental health counselor for an evaluation and advice. It’s likely that a few months of therapy and perhaps some medication for the anxiety will bring this under control.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: My fiance and I have been together for 4 years. When we first got together he told me everything about his past (I didn’t ask him) and asked me to do the same. From early on he would always tell me “girls who sleep with a lot of guys are gross, I would never be with a girl who would have sex with a lot of men” (even though he has had sex with over 50 women!) So when he asked me I told him I have had a lot of partners but left out 3 of them because I was really ashamed I had sex with those 3 people and also one of them he had met before. I had my own issues about them and was afraid he would leave me or judge me. [/INST]  There’s a lot more wrong with this situation than what you two are characterizing as “lies.” First, there is a difference between lying and maintaining some privacy. There is no rule that a person has to share every detail of one’s life in order to be trustworthy. It’s not new information to your boyfriend that you were intimate with others before him. The number isn’t the issue.Secondly, he has a strange double standard. It’s okay for him to have had sex with 50+ women but he thinks a woman who has had a number of relationships is gross? What century is he living in? Does he think he’s gross? Or only experienced? Why does he judge you differently than he judges himself?Third, you kept some things private because you were afraid of judgment. You didn’t believe he could offer you comfort and compassion for some mistakes you made. My guess is that all of his 50+ relationships weren’t stellar either. Please ask yourself why you want to be with someone who you don’t think will be supportive and helpful.Finally, your boyfriend is now using this new piece of information as justification for not trusting you and for making you walk on eggshells. Instead of looking at what a loving and faithful person you’ve been, he is focusing on this one issue (an issue that I feel should be a non-issue).You can’t change this situation. He has to change his attitude towards women and his issues about the fact that women can be just as sexual as men. I don’t know why you love this guy. I don’t think he’s worth your time or your love. Please think hard about whether you want to live the rest of your life always “on trial.”I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] It’s pretty easily explained, really: I’m bipolar (II) and as we probably all know, excessive guilt is a symptom of that. Still, I’m pretty sure, that guilty feelings are not supposed to be this strong. What I mean with that is, that my mind seems to randomly decide to start guilt-tripping me (mostly in the evening/at night). There’s no real trigger, nothing that causes it, as far as I know/realize. And it’s not simple “Man, why did I do this today?”-guilt, it’s straight out “I’m remembering all the bad stuff I ever did in my whole life right now and it’s crushing me”-guilt. Like, seriously, I remember everything I ever did, that you’d ever want to apologize for in those moments. It’s such a crushing sense of guilt, that I sometimes just start mumbling “I’m sorry.” over and over again, or even start crying. Mostly though, it just makes me feel completely restless. More fidgety than I’d ever be able to feel, if this wasn’t happening right then and there. That fidgety-ness mixes with pure uneasyness and guilt, at having screwed-up so much and so often. I start feeling like I’d deserve to die, because of all that I screwed up and all the people I (accidentally) screwed over. I’d never feel like that, if I wasn’t guilt-tripping myself, but in that moment, suicide seems like a pretty good idea – because I will feel like I’m unworthy of living because of all my screw-ups and like it’d keep me from screwing up again or from hurting someone else ever again. (Like I already said, I’d never contemplate suicide, if I wasn’t in a state like that, which is why it kind of worries me, because I’m not sure whether I won’t give in to that feeling someday.) And the only thing that makes the guilt-trips stop is hurting myself, and I’m pretty sure, that it’s not a good idea to just continually hurt myself for the rest of my life. So, I just wanted to ask, if you would know of some other way to stop those guilt-trips? Thanks in advance (even if you don’t know any). If possible, then please one without any kind of medication? My parents don’t know I’m bipolar and I don’t like medication in the first place, because I’m pretty forgetful and I’ll probably forget to take it. (age 16, from Germany) [/INST]  Thanks for writing in with your question. I’m sorry that you have so many burdens at such a young age, however, there is no easy answer that I can offer you. Bipolar Disorder is a serious condition that requires treatment, both from a psychiatrist and a therapist. I can only assume that you are not getting any type of treatment if your parents don’t know you have this disorder. Furthermore, the internet can be an excellent source for information and resources but you cannot diagnose yourself. To be sure of any diagnosis you need to be evaluated by a trained professional.Working with a therapist and being evaluated for medication should be your next step, which also means it is time to involve your parents. A therapist can help you learn to change your guilt ridden thought patterns and learn non-harming coping skills. In the meantime, you can also look into some workbooks (self-help) books written for teens. It can (and will) get better, but you have to learn some new techniques to manage your feelings.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST]  From Singapore: My GF (22 years old) and I had been together for 1 year plus and during this period, we broke out once before.

I used to find her beautiful, but now I started to feel otherwise why? [/INST]  Trust your feelings. Your relationship may be better, but you say you still don’t “dare” approach your girlfriend with your concerns. Honesty is the basis of a solid and committed relationship. Without honesty and the ability to work through issues, the relationship can’t last.I think you should try to talk with your girlfriend about your feelings and your anxiety about talking to her. If she can hear you with compassion and work on developing better communication with you, maybe you can rebuild your relationship. If she is cold or dismissive about your concerns or if she continues to restrict your ability to have friends, then maybe this relationship just isn’t for you.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m an only child, and have always been an introvert. For the most part I enjoy being by myself, but it can get really lonely at times. I have been in few relationships since my middleschool days, and most recently, a year long long distance relationship. She lives in California, me in Massachusetts. We just came to the conclusion that things cannot work out between us at this stage in our lives, being so far apart. She really dreads the distance and wants someone close by to constantly do things with, and who am I to deny her that? It would be selfish. I just want to throw in here that we did meet in person, twice, and it was the most amazing 10 days each visit, that I had ever spent with someone in a LONG time. There was no shyness involved even when I was meeting her for the first time as we had been constantly talking over the computer and phone for months. [/INST]  Social anxiety is not uncommon. Many people struggle with this issue. It is important that your anxiety levels match a given situation. In your case, your social anxiety levels are higher than they should be and thus it is creating a problem.My assessment of your situation is that you are avoiding dealing with your social anxiety. As you mentioned, you spend a lot of time on the Internet. You have many more interactions on the Internet than you do in person. The Internet is a way to escape social interactions but it is a poor substitute. The Internet helps, but it does not sufficiently fulfill your need for social interaction. One appropriate way to use the Internet would be to identify local people to meet and interact with in person.You mentioned that you do not want to join in-person activities because of your shyness. You mentioned that it would be inauthentic of you to join a group that that you did not truly believe in. You do not have to join groups or clubs of that kind. You could join groups or clubs that you are interested in. You could volunteer for causes that you do care about.It is easier not to deal with this issue and ignore your shyness but that will only make your anxiety increase. I would encourage you to force yourself into social situations and not to avoid interaction with others.You understand that you are shy and have difficulty interacting with others. Now that you are aware of this ongoing problem you should seek in-person counseling. It is important that you get the support of a therapist who can teach you how to deal with your social anxiety and who can help you to develop healthy social interaction skills. I would advise against seeking online help including Internet counseling or joining Internet support groups. They can serve as an adjunct to face-to-face counseling but they would not decrease your problems with shyness and social interaction.

From another marriage my mom had my youngest bro who I was the main caregiver To when she was diagnosed with breast cancer and received treatment since it was 15 I cared for my special needs bro for 11 years doing all his personal care my life has revolved around him. My parents tended to be controlling of me cause of this. Always needing me home never allowing me to have independence without some sort of threat. I ended up self-harming again those last 2 yrs in the home. I was stressed and overwhelmed. I ended up meeting a man that I now call my husband and I’m in a very healthy and happy relationship. However I made the decision to move without warning to my parents. And they reacted as I suspected my one brother cursed me out. My mother told me I was a bad sister and that I wasn’t allowed to see my brother whom I cared for. My stepdad refused to see me. And so I left. I have tried to maintain a relationship with my family.

My special needs bro I have had no contact with as she says he misses me and only will make it worse. My other brothers are mad I left and cut off all communication.

You are 26 and need to build a life of your own. Let her hold a grudge, or be angry, or whatever else she wants to do. My guess is that as time goes on you’ll find a way to reconnect with your special needs brother. But until then I would enter into some type of counseling to grieve leaving your family as you build a life for yourself.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I know there have been many in my situation, but I have yet to find a submission that has presented a clear answer to help with my situation. In October 2009 my wife found out I was cheating with a co-worker. I did not feel comfortable telling her all of the details at first so I continued lying as I felt I was protecting her already fragile state. I have been a liar since I can remember and I don’t know how to stop. I realize I personally make the decision to lie every time I do it, but that doesn’t seem to get in the way when it comes down to making a decision whether or not to lie. We have severe financial problems and will more than likely lose our home. My wife has told me we won’t be married after she graduates from nursing school but we haven’t separated yet because we have 3 children together and she doesn’t have an income. I have been getting payday loans to subsidize my income and have paid a significant amount towards those loans to keep things as normal as possible for the kids. So goes the lying. I get loans my wife doesn’t know about to keep things normal and she always finds out I have been getting money somewhere and I end up telling her the truth. She says I am childish for always lying and adds what I’ve done to the list of reasons we are getting divorced. I told her tonight I fear for my life sometimes because she doesn’t seem to have control over herself when she is in a fit of rage over what I’ve done. She has made comments in the past that she would “stab me” and she would “get off” if she were to kill me (because I cheated). I know what I did to her was terrible and I feel like a terrible person every day. I live in a manic world to keep myself from going off the deep end. I have been told I can’t leave my house because I will be abandoning my children and the courts will not award any custody to me if I do. She, however, wants me to leave immediately. I told her about my fear and she got extremely angry, told me I was selfish and started crying because that statement meant I didn’t care about what I put her through. The fact is, I didn’t know how to help her. I let myself get in the way a lot since she found out and she wouldn’t let me provide comfort when she was in pain. I have never, nor will I ever inflict harm on her, but I fear her statement are true and the mental anguish I have caused is the reason she cut herself some this past year and almost overdosed on drugs. I am writing this because I want to stop lying. I am writing this because I want to know how to get out of the situation I am in without a huge legal mess. I love my kids; I love to be around them. If I had my choice I would never leave their sides. I can’t, however, feel like I am a good parent for allowing them to live in the environment I have created. My wife has not recovered to the point where she can get out of bed at a decent hour and function with them. For months after she found out she would sleep most of the day while they were left to fend for themselves. I didn’t know what to do because I feared I would lose my job and make things even worse. PLEASE HELP!! Or, help me to find a good counselor in my area that accepts my insurance. I can’t afford to pay the co-pays all the time so that has kept me from going. The last counselor I had fell asleep in the chair while I was talking. [/INST]  I am glad that you are making an effort to reach out and seek some help. The find help tab at the top of the page will help you find a counselor in your area. See if you can negotiate a sliding scale fee where the co-pay can be reduced. You may also want to look into the offerings at your local hospital for an outpatient program that will accept your insurance. I mention this first because you will need to have therapy to go through the changes I am suggesting.I can’t give you legal advice, but I can encourage you to seek several opinions. Your wife wants you to leave and you are looking to do the right thing—so the question becomes how to make that happen. Your wife may want to get the names of some lawyers from the local women’s center. Often lawyers connected with a women’s center are savvy when it comes to helping with legal issues surrounding separation and divorce. You need someone with a great deal of experience legally in this area and getting more than one opinion is important. Often psychological needs and legal issues clash, but you won’t be the first couple to be in this dilemma. Learn how others have found a legal way through. Otherwise the situation tends to get worse as couples marinate in their own negativity. Let’s not wait for something drastic to happen before making a change that sounds necessary.People who continually lie to others are usually lying to themselves. It sounds like you need to start taking much greater responsibility for yourself, your situation, your children’s future and your own. Ask yourself what your truth is and begin with that.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been to a counselor about my depression, I am planning on going to her again soon, but I would like a second opinion. So I have been in college for close to 2 years now and I haven’t been able to make any friends. I feel alone a lot of the time. I usually listen to music to liven me up, but it hasn’t been working lately. My last roommate was one of my best friends from high school, but he dropped out of school. I now have a new roommate he is nice, but really shy around me. Just goes in his room and shuts his door when I am home too. I have been trying to keep a job, but I usually get in a depressed mood and don’t want to go anywhere, so I get fired or they assume I quit. [/INST]  It also sounds as though you are effectively blaming yourself for not making new friends. It may not be your fault. You describe yourself as “boring” for a lack of partying but I would not have made that characterization. Not wanting to party is typically a sign of maturity. It may be that you simply have different interests than those with whom you currently associate; it will likely not always be that way.A significant concern about your depression is that it has hurt you occupationally. You stated that you can’t keep a job because of your depression. That is clear evidence of how depression is degrading the quality of your life.It’s encouraging that you are resuming therapy. In therapy, it will be important to analyze your social skills, your fears about approaching others, and what is the root of your depression. It’s unclear from your letter if your depression is caused by your current situation or some other factor.You should also consider medication to help improve your mood. Medication works best in tandem with psychotherapy. If you’re willing to engage in treatment, then you should expect a successful therapeutic outcome. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Whenever I bring up something that genuinely upsets me, my father and brothers actively ignore it, and let my emotionally abusive mother talk me down. No matter what topic I introduce, it always ends with her segueing into how ungrateful and unforgiving and irresponsible I am, and how because of that I’m the only one who’s dissatisfied with my family’s state now. I firmly believe in “sins of the father” so I can determine which parts of my behavior were learned from my family (inability to apologize, inappropriate and inadequate affections, etc), plus I can see it for myself with how badly they treat our dogs (the maid feeds them and I walk them, and the family itself doesn’t express affection until they’re “obedient”).

I would take the time and think about what you need with various options and a timeline.Research shows that having a clear and fixed goal helps us feel better all along the way as we move toward it. You can get more information about that here. As it seems you are not going to get much help from your parents, the important thing would be to look at places you already are receiving support, emotional and otherwise, and see if you can draw from these to increase your support network by using the connections you already have.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My girlfriend had a manic/psychotic episode in Oct. As far as her parents know it was her first. She spent money, drank, didn’t sleep, was sexually promiscuous and thought she was an angel. She was put on meds and went to therapy. She stopped going to group therapy b/c she said that they all had problems. She did continue to see a therapist for a bit. She stopped b/c she did not think the therapist was helping her. She said that they would just talk for 5 min. and then would let her go. We split up during this time, but kept in contact. We decided to get back together and take it slow. [/INST] Suggest to your girlfriend that she consider therapy. Medication could really help her with the mood swings associated with bipolar disorder but as you said, she will not stay on the medication. Maybe if she found a therapist whom she likes and trusts, with his or her help, she may be able to stabilize. You can suggest this to your girlfriend but she may not take your advice.It seems like she is replacing one unhealthy behavior with another. She went from drinking to obsessively exercising. She is rationalizing the excessive exercising by saying “at least I am not drinking.” She is right in one respect. It is good that she is not drinking but exercising two to three times a day is most likely a sign of mania or OCD, as you mentioned. (OCD can co-occur with bipolar disorder but many of her symptoms may also be mania.)Clearly she is in need of help. She is currently not stable and may be heading toward an episode.My advice is this: ask her if she will consider therapy. If she is reluctant, offer to go to therapy with her, for couples therapy. Maybe she’ll go if you are willing to go as well. Also, offer to go to the doctor with her. Monitor her care if you can and try to enforce the doctor’s treatment instructions. If you become more involved in her care, she might be more willing to follow the doctor’s orders.But also realize that there may be little that you can do. You cannot force anyone to go to treatment or take medication no matter how much you believe or know that he or she could benefit from such care.People with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia often have difficulty recognizing the need for treatment. Family members often have to battle with their mentally ill family members in order to convince them to take the needed medication or follow the prescribed treatment plan.You might also want to visit the National Alliance of the Mentally Ill (NAMI) website. NAMI is a national advocacy group that helps and supports families dealing with many of the same issues you are facing with your girlfriend.I wish you luck.

"<s>[INST] My boyfriend has periods when he gets insecure and jealous that he becomes very different and thinks there is a secret among the rest of the world that he isn’t included in regarding hooking up. He also sees words as code. He’ll look at my email spam and for instance if the word is Float, he thinks each letter stands for another word. [/INST]  It is possible that your boyfriend may be experiencing delusional disorder but only an in-person, psychiatric evaluation could confirm that diagnosis. Two possible signs of the disorder include his belief that words, as “codes”, have a hidden meaning and his paranoia with regard to you cheating. The fact that he had an ex-wife who cheated may make him hypersensitive to the possibility of cheating but his intense focus on your alleged infidelity is unusual.Delusional disorder is a type of mental illness that involves psychosis. Psychosis is a break with reality. Psychosis involves the inability to distinguish what is real from what is not real. A delusion is the belief that something is real, despite evidence to the contrary.Individuals with delusional disorders experience “non-bizarre delusions.” An example of a non-bizarre delusion is the belief that someone is being poisoned, followed, conspired against, or admired from a distance. There are six main types of delusions associated with delusional disorders. Jealous is one of them. Individuals experiencing a jealous type of delusion believe that their partner or spouse is cheating in the absence of evidence to support their belief.If your partner is willing, he should undergo a psychiatric evaluation by a mental health professional. With regard to psychotic disorders, treatment is particularly important because generally, delusions do not go away on their own. They can become worse in frequency and in intensity. Medication could reduce or eliminate his delusions. It may not be easy to convince him to see a mental health professional but it would be in his best interest.Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I am about 6.5 months pregnant, and since I have gotten pregnant my husband has refused sex all but one time early on. I am very frustrated. He says it is because it is weird to think about with the baby, but I know that is not the real issue because we have always struggled. Sometimes he will admit that he has an issue — or we have an issue. But after he admits that, he refuses to discuss solutions because he is too embarrassed to make any steps to change it. (I believe.) [/INST]  A positive sex life is an important part of communicating love and tenderness and commitment in a marriage. You are probably correct that the various reasons your husband has had for avoiding sex aren’t the real problem. And you may be right that he is having a difficult time overcoming the teachings of his upbringing. When people have been repeatedly told that sex is sinful and should be avoided before marriage, it’s difficult for some people to flip a switch on their wedding day and suddenly have uninhibited joyful sex.The best thing you can do is be both sympathetic to his difficulties and compassionate toward yourself. You already know that you won’t get anywhere nagging or scolding. But perhaps he will hear you if you talk about how much you just want the two of you to be close on all levels: spiritual, emotional and physical. I hope he will consider some couples counseling to help the two of you find ways to help him relax into being a mature and sexual partner. He sounds like a jewel in every other way and certainly worth the effort.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Me and my husband have been together for 2years and half..But the past months we have been fighting constantly, and I know it’s all because of me..My husband told me he had joined the strip-clubs before he meet me with his friends..Since then,I feel like he is one of those dirty man who paid to see dirt naked women. [/INST]  Jealousy is bad for any relationship. It is unpleasant, anxiety and anger producing and at times, embarrassing. If you continue to let the jealousy and anger fester it has the potential to seriously damage your marriage. It is good that you are amenable to taking steps to correct the problem. That is very encouraging and it’s a good place to start.It’s not fair to be angry at your husband for activities he engaged in during a time when he did not know you. His history should not be a factor in your current relationship. What he did before he knew you is history and it should stay that way. History cannot be changed. Most people would probably change many things about their past if they could but they can’t. They must accept that fact and move on. It is the reality of the situation.You’re particularly upset about the fact that he saw semi-nude or naked women dance at the strip club. Apparently you are comparing yourself to girls at the strip club and coming to the conclusion that because he has seen them naked they are better-looking than you and thus you are inferior to them. This is jealousy. This is you not feeling good about yourself or your body.These feelings of inferiority are emanating from you. They have little to do with your husband. Your husband did not make you feel this way; you felt this way on your own when you heard about the strip club.If your self-esteem and self-confidence are low or nonexistent and you are aware that it’s negatively impacting your marriage then you need to find a way to correct this problem. As you mentioned, you are the one feeling unloved and unhappy. Your husband does not seem to feel that way about you.Therapy can help you to change your thinking as well as change your behavior. If you do not want to try therapy you could also try self-analysis.Self-analysis would start with you being objective about your situation. Here are the facts as I see it: you have a husband who loves you and in your words, “believes in you.” He seems to be acting in a manner consistent with a husband who is devoted to his wife. You did not say that he spent time surfing the net for pornography or going to strip clubs. He went once to a strip club and if you asked him, he would probably say that it was a non-event in his life.The goal of self-analysis is to be able clearly and accurately assess the situation and to think through how you could correct the problem. It requires that logic, and not emotions, leads to an understanding of the situation. If you are having difficulty with self-analysis and feel you need an outside, objective opinion, consider seeing a therapist. It could save the relationship as well as your self-esteem. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  Although I know it’s wrong to self-diagnose, I self-diagnosed myself with dysthymia just in February because I started thinking about killing myself, although I never actualized my thoughts (because I know it’s wrong), when before, starting when I was around 8, I just thought of about how life for me and for everyone else around me might be better off without me being born – because I noticed the favoritism of my parents toward me over my sister. [/INST]  The only way to know if you have a mental illness is to be evaluated by a mental health professional. As you correctly noted, it’s not good to self-diagnose. Therefore you should avoid it.Your thoughts, as of late, are concerning. Any time someone is considering suicide or homicide, it’s a sign that they are in distress and need help. Thoughts about suicide and homicide are indicators of a problem. Contented people don’t think about ending their lives or the lives of other people.If you suspect that you have a mental illness, then seek professional help. It would help to reduce or eliminate your distressing thoughts. I’m not familiar with the mental health system in your country but seek out counseling, if such services are available. That would be the most efficient and responsible course of action. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello! I know that there are a few questions in this topic, I browsed through them, but I didn’t seem to find one that applies well to me. I can’t talk to people properly except for a very few (my family and my best friend), I often fall silent and don’t speak for hours just sit and smile or communicate through facial expressions and touches and the likes. [/INST]  Often, this kind of problem is actually the “solution” for another more hidden problem. If I were seeing you, I’d be looking for how losing your spoken voice helps you avoid or escape something that is painful to you. It might be helpful to trace when thinking your words were entities started. Something may have happened that makes it all make a kind of sense. We would then work on that.I hope you will consider seeing a mental health counselor for some help with this. Your letter shows you to be a sensitive person who doesn’t want to hurt her friends and family. If you could have taken charge of the problem, you would have done so already. A few sessions with a skilled therapist may help you get to the root of the issue so you can have the kind of relationships you want and deserve.I wish you well,  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  My father has always been close to my two sisters and I. Even transitioning into adolescence, I never felt that my father was embarrassing. We were his best friends and he was ours. [/INST]  What a loving and devoted daughter you really are. Many young women your age would be so focused on their own happiness that they would not be concerned with their parents’. I think part of the problem is that your father is trying to live by the traditional rules of a generation or so ago while you and your sister are very much of this time and place. It’s not a matter or right or wrong. It’s a matter of there being a huge difference in each generation’s expectations for adult children.In the dominant culture in the US, it’s normal and appropriate for young people to grow up, to find a romantic partner, and to leave home to make a new family, while the older generation renews their own relationship (if they have one), spends time with their long-time friends, and pursues their own interests. By more old-world values, adult children stay very connected to the family of origin and often care for their parents until they die.It sounds to me like your father hasn’t made a life for himself so is expecting his children to make a life for him. Yes, it’s fully possible to be an adult and to be close to your dad but he has to be willing to be part of the project. You can’t make him be happy. He has to come to terms with the idea that you have different ideas about what it means to be an adult. It may help if he can understand that it is a testament to his good fathering that you and your sister want to marry, even after having witnessed so much discord in your parents’ marriage.A frank talk with your father about these issues might help but I’m concerned that you may not know how to approach him out of your worry that you will hurt him. For that reason, I think it would be helpful for you to consider seeing a therapist for a few sessions. I don’t think there is anything wrong with you. I do think that you need some practical advice and support that is beyond what I can provide in a letter. After a few sessions, it might be useful for you to invite your father to join you. With a therapist’s support, you might be able to help your father understand how grateful you are to him but that you would appreciate his blessing as you move into the next stage of life.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, my mom has had Schizophrenia since I was born. Having seeing her before her medication has definitely scarred me but that’s not the problem. Even on her medication she still talks to herself, every time I hear it, I hear a little too much and it hurts my feelings pretty bad. She has tried to divorce my dad twice but we expected it was because of her schizophrenia because she ended up coming back both times. So every day I have no idea what would happen next, sometimes I get paranoid that she might do something really bad. When I hear her talking to herself I usually hear her talking crap about some family member but she always tells me that she loves me and everyone else. I really don’t know what to do to feel more comfortable with my mom around the house. [/INST]  I am very sorry that you are faced with this challenging situation. I would encourage you to speak to your father. Make him aware of your fears about your mother. He may also be unaware of the fact that your mother continues to have symptoms despite being on medication. This is a sign that she may need her medication adjusted. It may also mean that she is not taking her medication.Is there an adult family member or family friend with whom you can stay? Moving may not be an option but ideally it would be best for you to be removed from the chaotic home environment. Having a strong, supportive person in your life is important. It helps you to feel safe and protected in your home. It is difficult to relax in an unpredictable living environment.If you believe that your mother is a threat to herself or to others, then it is imperative to call the authorities or the local mental health crisis team. I fully understand and appreciate how difficult making that call might be but safety is paramount. If she is a danger to herself or to others, the hospital can protect her. It may not be the ideal option but it is the most effective option.Finally, you and your father should consider contacting the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). NAMI has support groups for individuals who have family members with mental illnesses. They have support groups in virtually every city across the country. NAMI support group members are dealing with issues that are very similar to yours. Having that support may assist your family in dealing with this situation.

"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: My mother has always been critical, but now her behavior is becoming more bold. When she’s called out, she claims to forget or accuses others of misinterpreting her or being too sensitive. She calls people fat in public when they might hear her, but she says doesn’t remember. She commands me to tell her I love her even when I just said it and then tells everyone I refuse to but everyone just heard me. When I get upset she says it’s all a joke, but it’s not really funny, just awkward. Her behavior is bizarre and she’s started to tell me the same stories every time we’re on the phone, just rambling. [/INST] Yes, this is serious. You can tell your family I think so.By all means — get her to her doctor. It’s possible that her behavior is the result of a vitamin deficiency. Really, I’ve seen it before. But it’s also possible that she is in the early stages of Alzheimers or some other dementia. Only a physician will be able to tease out what is wrong — and give you suggestions for treatment. See if the doctor can give you some advice about how to get her in for an exam. He might, for example, be willing to have his staff call her with a reminder that she is due for a physical.Your mother is fortunate to have such a caring daughter in spite of her negative, even abusive, behavior. Just because she can’t acknowledge it doesn’t mean it isn’t so. You are being very good to her.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the Arabian Gulf: My boss, also a “friend”, has – multiple times over the last couple years – insisted that first hand experiences of mine never happened. She will literally dig in her heels, turn pink and argue with me relentlessly that what I’m saying didn’t happen, despite it being my experience, her not being there, and the issue not being all that important. It’s infuriating. And when I stand my ground she doubles down on her argument, especially if there are staff or her family around. She’s never done it in front of HER friends. [/INST]  You are a highly educated professional woman. It could be that your boss feels threatened by you. She is therefore engaging in what is called “gas lighting”. Gaslighting is a type of emotional abuse. To gain more power, the abuser makes a victim question her own perceptions of reality, her judgment, and her feelings. Gaslighters keep their victim confused by a variety of methods. For example, they act as if they have the victim’s best interests at heart or they suggest they are the only person who cares or that they are the best friend the victim has. Over time, the constant questioning of their reality and shifting of the relationship gradually wears the victim down.If this person were a friend or family member, I’d suggest you take as much distance from her as you could. But the fact that she is your boss complicates things considerably. Do start looking for another job. You will never win an argument with her. She is not interested in advancing your career. Regardless of what she says during friendly moments, she is undermining your self-esteem and your belief in yourself.In the meantime here are some suggestions for what to do:I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Last week my girlfriend’s ex-husband passed due to an overdose. They were married 20 years. He left behind a 30 year old stepdaughter and a 19 year old daughter. Apparently he did not take the div very well and was very depressed. Five years into their marriage she had an affair which certainly did not help then or now. The div was final 2 years ago this month. Since the div he also kept himself from the daughter – rarely called her and didn’t want her knowing where he lived. [/INST]  It’s to your credit that your girlfriend turns to you for comfort and support. You’re right that she needs your friendship and patience as well as your love. It’s not surprising that she can’t be intimate with you while she sorts out her feelings and takes care of things that undoubtedly stir up lots of memories good and bad about a long marriage. I understand that it’s hard to be compassionate when you have no reason to care about the guy and it’s difficult to feel her pull away from you for a bit. But it’s unrealistic and unfair for you to want this to be over in a week. It’s going to take some time. I doubt your girlfriend is feeling guilty. (I certainly hope not.) If you didn’t tell her you were going out to give her space, she might have felt abandoned. She may also be picking up on your disapproval.I’m hearing some insecurity in your letter. It’s as if you think her reaction to the death of her ex is any reflection on her love for you. It’s probably not. You are also concerned that if the situation were reversed, she wouldn’t be there for you. If the circumstances with your ex are different, of course it would be different. If you don’t think she can be your best friend in a time of trouble, that speaks to a larger issue in your relationship that is quite separate from what’s going on now.It’s normal for someone to want to talk out her grief when someone she once loved (and had a child with) dies tragically. It’s normal for someone to grieve what might have been. It’s absolutely normal for a mother to do her best to help her daughter process all that has happened. It makes sense for her to take on sorting through belongings and bills as a way to show her daughter how to be compassionate and responsible.This is the kind of situation that tests what you are made of. If you can be loving, compassionate and understanding while she and her daughter work through their sadness and anger, they will be forever grateful. If you can’t, the relationship probably won’t survive. I hope you can dig deep and find a way to stay respectful, patient, and loving.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My best friend and I are very different from each other but we have grown a very strong relationship over the years. She is a smart, highly educated, 32 year old virgin that I hardly think has ever even kissed someone. Myself, I have been in many relationships but am currently single, 32 years old as well. My friend has been growing as a person a lot over the last year, and in August she came to me and said she´d started dating someone she met online. I was very supportive that she started online dating, and thrilled that she wanted to go out for drinks, buy shoes with high heals, and I encouraged more social behaviour. She dated this guy for a few weeks and it ended. Then, about 6 weeks ago she called me at 00.30 on a Thursday night, asking if she could come over because she had something to tell me. I got a bit stressed thinking it must be serious, because it was so late, and because it could not wait. She told me that when she started dating that online-guy they had sex. He was her first, and they were not in love. Then she told me that she liked it rough and he could not give her what she wanted. She had therefore joined a sadomasochistic sex society, went to an information meeting and now attends meetings and parties. This just after having sex for the first time a few weeks earlier. She told me she didn’t want to lie to me and wanted me to know what was going on, because we are so close and I know everything that is going on in her life. This particular night she came straight from a 45-year-old man she had had sex with. My friend and I have hardly ever talked about sex, I have even wondered that she might be a lesbian without knowing it herself yet. I was shocked to say the least. We live in a small city with 300 000 inhabitants, big enough to be anonymous, but still. I want her to experience love and sex, not sex as a mechanistic act. The days after her confession I felt confused and sad, kind of like I’m losing her. Now she has a complete new side to her life that I cant share with her, and she has met so many new people. People of all sorts with a variety of sex-interests, some living in polygamist relationships. A lot that is new to me, but I wish to be open-minded. One week after the breaking news she attended a party and met a guy wearing latex clothes. Lets call him Alan. They jumped straight into a relationship, and one week after they first met, Alan and his friend joined my friend and I at a cabin trip (because he was going to Kuala Lumpur in a few days for work). He was rude to me and I did not like his attitude. He seems very emotionally unstable (I have a PhD in neuroscience), and recently got out of a 6-year relationship, just 2 months prior. He kept talking about his ex and how she being mentally ill had ruined their relationship. Apparently this ex-girlfriend grew up in several foster homes and was sexually abused, married a 25-year-older man that she left – including the children because she was an unfit mother. Later on it was revealed that this old father had abused the children too, and she got the custody back. Then she met Alan. Alan is dominant and my best friend likes to be dominated, apparently. I cant help but think that Alan sort of “liked” being with a damaged woman that he could help and further dominate. I don’t know, but it bothers me how negatively he was talking about her. All matters have two sides. Now my friend talks about Alan constantly and is in love. She has already introduced him to her parents and some of our other friends. After only 5 weeks acquaintance. She really wants me to like him. However, I find it really hard to like him and her new lifestyle. I feel like I have lost her and that our friendship has changed forever. It makes me really sad, she has been such an important part of my life for so long. I feel like she has put a lot on me, the sex-club in itself will take some time to accept. However, introducing a man to me just a few days after the confession and expecting me to like him, is just too much. How should I react to this? I am trying to be happy for her, but in a way I don’t want to. It’s quite possible that if I don’t like this new guy I will lose my best friend. Should I just move on and accept that we have become too different now? I would really appreciate some thoughts about this, I have no-one I can discuss it with. (From Norway) [/INST]   Don’t try holding onto a relationship that causes you so much anguish. Be clear about your limitations. Have compassion for her as she explore this part of her journey, but don’t feel obligated to save her from herself. She is an adult making adult choices and some of the consequenses of doing that involves losing friends. Be honest with her about your reactions — explaining that it is hard to watch her change so rapidly. My best guess is that she will need you when things don’t work out, or there is a crisis, or a fallout of some kind. The real work might be how you handle rekindling the friendship.For now moving on makes the most sense — but done with enough sensitivity that you would be able to rekindle the friendship downstream if need be. </s>"

I would suggest that you continue to educate yourself.  Please look up information on the “cycle of violence” and the “power and control wheel.” These are two concepts that come from theories relating to domestic violence. Control is the real issue and that is what you are describing here.Educating yourself on the patterns, relying on your support system of friends and family for strength, and cutting off all communication with him are the first steps. Respecting yourself enough to believe that you deserve better is also very important. It can be really hard to break up with someone that you may still have feelings for but realize the relationship is unhealthy. It’s especially hard to break up with someone who has controlled and manipulated you. That is why it is so important to get support.Most domestic violence shelters either have counselors that work there or they keep lists of counselors they can refer to. I would suggest that you get connected with your local shelter for extra support. You deserve to be in a relationship with someone who respects you. Please give yourself that chance.All the best, </s>"

Barrel in mouth as the skull splits and cracks apart. Blood and gray matter spattered against the opposing wall. Or, I’ll fantasize about driving my car into a tree at 70mph, head on. I can’t shake these thoughts, and I have no real intention of killing myself. I have self-harmed in the past, and I still fantasize about that too. I know I need to talk to someone about this, but I’m scared I’ll be hospitalized or something, and I can’t afford that right now. (I can’t miss anymore work…). Is it normal to have these thoughts of suicide? What should I do? [/INST]  Thoughts of suicide are abnormal. They signify psychological distress. In your letter, you did not describe your situation in detail but you could be suffering from depression. Suicide never crosses the minds of happy, contented people. Depressed people, who are unhappy with their lives, might erroneously believe that suicide is a way to end their unhappiness.It’s not likely that a therapist would consider you a candidate for hospitalization. A person is hospitalized against their will when they pose an imminent threat to themselves or to others. Daydreams and thoughts are not typically sufficient, in themselves, to pose imminent danger. If you have no intention to end your life or deliberate plans to end your life, then hospitalization is unlikely.The wisest approach to deal with unhappiness is counseling. Begin the process by interviewing at least four or five therapists. They are not all the same. Choose the one with whom you have the strongest connection. You have nothing to fear. In fact, it will be a great relief.At your first meeting, discuss what’s bothering you. The therapist will give you his or her impression about what they think the problem is. Then, a plan to treat the problem will be determined. If you are open and committed to treatment, then expect a positive outcome.

Do i have a sort of Schizophrenia? Or is it just some weird hallucinations? I really don’t know what to do. [/INST]  A common question that I receive, mostly from teenagers, involves the idea of having two people in their head or a split brain or some variation thereof. In the vast majority of cases, I believe that they are describing an inner voice or what some researchers call subvocal speech. This phenomenon is experienced by everyone and it basically refers to internal mental dialogue. Virtually everyone hears a running mental dialogue.People with psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, seem to hear an inner dialogue of voices that they don’t recognize. Studies have shown that non-psychotic persons recognize this voice as their own, whereas people with psychotic disorders think it is someone else’s voice or several other people’s voices. Naturally, hearing unrecognizable voices would be frightening.You mentioned consciousness and I’m not certain if you were describing the experience of hearing voices or something else. I would need to more information to fully understand what you are experiencing.Generally speaking, if you are in psychological distress, you should consult a mental health professional. He or she can evaluate your symptoms and determine if something is wrong. Most importantly, they will design a treatment plan to address your symptoms. I would highly recommend having an evaluation.

My dad would get drunk and throw plates at my mother and on bad nights my dad would come into our room and break our toys. Both my parents grew up in terrible environments so my understanding was that being mean was all they knew. The last straw for me was my sophomore year in high school when my father was supposed to pick me up, my phone died and I was late getting to his car, he screamed at me and told me to walk home, 4 miles in the dark without a phone. [/INST]  You and your boyfriend deserve to feel enormous pride for what you’ve been able to accomplish in spite of tragedy and hardship. Don’t let anyone, ever, take that away from you.The power of addiction is enormous. Although it feels to you like you were unwanted and unloved by your dad, I doubt that was the case. It felt that way because the addiction was even bigger than the love. Imagine how big, then, the addiction was – and perhaps is. It dominated your dad’s life. If that were not bad enough, neither parent had grown up learning the skills needed to cope with life, stay sober and raise kids. My guess is that you are doing so well because you learned from their bad example. You know what not to do.Your father may have turned his life around in terms of stopping drinking. But he still has a lot to learn about taking responsibility for his life. He is still acting like an addict — shifting blame rather than owning up to his own past. There is no way you could “make” your mother turn against him. You simply don’t have that power. Having meaningful conversations with her where you both acknowledge the family history and figure out how to do better is important to healing the family.Although it’s commendable that you want to include your parents in your life in spite of how they have treated you, it will continue to be challenging. Your father, especially, may not be ready to do it. Fortunately, you don’t have to figure this out on your own. If you haven’t already, I suggest you find out if there is a local chapter of Al-Anon in your community.

I have a problem with this because I consider myself to be a private person and last week she keyed into our apartment when I was in the shower (we currently do not have a lock on the bathroom door). Also, my fiance works the overnight shift so he sleeps during the day. I have tried to be quiet while he sleeps. I am a full-time student and I usually work on my assignments quietly during the day. When his mother keys into our apartment during the day, she is rather loud and opens the door to our bedroom to check in on her son (who by the way is almost 30). My fiance is close with his mother and I don’t know how to tell him I am uncomfortable with this situation without offending him and his mother. His mother has been known to hold grudges and I don’t want to get on her bad side before I marry her son. Please help! This is driving me nuts! Thanks. [/INST]  Let me get this right: Your fiance’s mother is opening the bedroom door to “check on” her son? Is she worried he’ll be abducted by aliens? What if you two were having a bit of afternoon delight??? At 30, it’s long past time for an adjustment in their relationship. In fairness, she may simply be continuing an old habit. Apparently this worked for your fiance and his mother for a long time. But when things are different, they’re different. You are now an important part of the equation.Start with your fiance. There’s no need to blame or be angry with his mother or to be upset with him — at least initially. She doesn’t see her behavior as unusual. He apparently sleeps through her intrusion so it may be new information to him that you are bothered by her visits. For those reasons, I suggest you focus on your needs for privacy and uninterrupted study time, not on his mother’s lack of boundaries or their unusual arrangement. Ask him to talk to his mother about making other plans for her lunch hour now that he’s engaged. She can keep the key for emergencies but he should be clear exactly what an “emergency” is. (Not having a place to go for lunch is not an emergency. Being locked out of her car when there’s a blizzard is.)If he can’t do that, your problem is with your fiance, not with his mother. Marriage and making a life with someone means shifting our primary alliance from our family of origin to our new family in the making. That doesn’t mean that love, concern, and caring stops. It doesn’t mean that parents can’t be an important part of our lives. It does mean that there needs to be some boundaries between the generations in order to let the new family figure out their own rules, rituals, and routines. This is not something to be offended about. It’s part of the usual cycle of life. My guess is that your future mother-in-law went through a similar transition when she first married.If your fiance feels he can’t talk with his mother or if his mother sees this as a reason to hold a grudge, you have another problem. You are then confronted with the strong possibility that to marry your man means to accept his mother as a part of the daily package. Only you can decide if it’s worth it.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My now husband has trust issues, we have had a tumultuous relationship for the last 15 years, have a child, and in the last year we got back together engaged. [/INST]   Your husband’s insecurity is likely at the root. I doubt there is anything that you can do that you haven’t already done to ensure your commitment. It is also very likely that his dragging up this issue on a regular basis is his way of preventing a more intimate connection with you. By pulling this issue out of the bag he can keep himself from being fully committed to you.I would set a very strong boundary about this type of emotional abuse from him. Explain that you won’t tolerate it as it isn’t what you signed up for when you came back, and that if he can’t quit on his own you want to go to couple therapy with him to let a professional help.This sort of thing tends to come from very insecure men who have jealousy issues that put all of the responsibility on their partner. It is a way of them not dealing with their own need to mature emotionally by belittling. Don’t stand for it.The find help tab at the top of the page will help you find a therapist in your area and this organization may have some good couple referrals as well.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have not been feeling like myself at all lately. I feel like everyone who is surrounding me doesn’t actually like me. I have cut myself recently because I find it calming. I get sad and down a lot and I am constantly worrying about what other people think of me. I have been tired no matter how much sleep I get. I also don’t know what emotions I am feeling, I can’t identify them. I tell people I’m just said if they ask but in reality, I have no idea what I am feeling. Maybe I’m feeling nothing at all, I don’t know. Sometimes I plan out how I would kill myself even though I know I would never do it. I also have zero motivation to do anything and when I try to do my schoolwork I cannot concentrate at all. I always get distracted. [/INST]  Yes. You do need help. It’s not normal to want to kill yourself. Nor is it normal to cut yourself. People who are thinking about suicide or who are cutting themselves are suffering. It could be depression, but it could be something else. Depression and related disorders are highly responsive to treatment.The best way to know what might be wrong and most importantly how to fix it, is to consult a mental health professional. They will know how to help you. They receive specialized training for exactly these problems. You will feel a great deal of relief when you have someone offering support and guidance.Ask your parents to help you find a mental health professional in your community. If that’s not an option, the school counselor or trusted faculty member is your next best option. They can assist you in finding the right treatment for you. Finally, if you believe that you might harm yourself, call the authorities or go to the hospital. They can protect you and connect you with mental health professionals who will help. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Since I was younger, my mother always got caught being on a call with other men, even before she and my dad got divorced about 5 years ago. Now she’s the only one who pays our bills, being the single mother. After she got divorced with her second husband, she started to become the old her, receiving calls from married men, having a date with them. Maybe because of her, I’ve always being skeptical about marriage, thinking if all men will cheat–there will be no point of being married. [/INST]   I think it is always alright to express how you feel about what is happening, when you are talking about YOUR feelings. Saying, “I’m upset when I see you dating married men because it makes me feel like there is no value in marriage,” is different than trying to make your mom feel guilty. You are always entitled to your feelings, but you will almost always be in for a fight if you try to make someone else feel ashamed of what they’ve done. Try to express your feelings without trying to shame your mother, and start thinking about moving out and having your own adult life out from under your mom’s influence.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  Men have always found me beautiful & pursued me. I love men too & love knowing I’m so desirable. Guys also think I’m awesome & allow me access into their friendship circles including inviting me to “guys only” events. Women hate me for this & I don’t like them either because of their behavior. I always have my nails, toes, & hair done. I love pretty clothes. I am totally a woman but I don’t think like one. I left a trail of heartbroken men in my wake over the years. I loved them & left them. I didn’t want to be tied down. My male friends admired me. They called me The Untamable & Heartbreaker w/ so much respect in their voices. I have an explosive temper & I react with violence. Once it burns out it’s over. I never cry. Ever. If you hurt my feelings I get angry. I can’t stand gossip & ripping people behind their backs. If I have something to say, I tell you face to face. I cannot stand girl games w/ men and even now as a married woman I don’t want/need to call or “hear his voice” during work hours, don’t have to be lied to, don’t mind if he goes out w/ friends, etc. I do NOT want to cuddle, hold hands, say I Love You every 5 mins. So in relationships I’m a guy instead of a girl. Sex is big also. I have a high libido. 15 years later we still have sex 6+ days a week.

I LOVE rough sex, hardcore dirty talk & men that have so much harnessed aggression you can see it humming under his skin. I love performing fellatio and driving a man wild until his brain shuts down & he goes primal in bed. Sex is supposed to be raw & instinctual isn’t it? Every man I’ve slept with has become sexually enthralled. My husband says it’s because most women refuse to satisfy men. Women call me psychologically damaged. I’ve been told I need professional help and that I have too much testosterone. Why am I like this? PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!!! [/INST]  As you search for an answer to an important question, you must recognize the absolute necessity to base that answer on fact and not upon assumptions or misconceptions. If your facts are wrong, your answers will also be wrong. Put the wrong numbers into an equation and you can be sure that the solution to that equation will be wrong.Much of what you have written about men and women is simply a stereotype. No matter how widely believed or commonly accepted a stereotype is, by definition, it is incorrect. For instance, is it true that men do not like to cuddle? No, it is not. Many men, like to cuddle. Is it true that all women wear makeup, have their nails painted and their hair done? No, many women never paint their fingernails or toenails and do not have their hair done. Is it true that all women want to cuddle? No, it is not. Is it true that women will not tell you to your face but will only gossip about you and talk about you behind your back? No, it is not true. These are stereotypes that are popularized, often widely believed but are simply, untrue. Male and female stereotypes have been well studied in peer-reviewed research and have all proven to be untrue.You cannot judge yourself by these false stereotypes. Are women more emotional than men? Absolutely not. Is it true that men do not cry? No, men do cry even though they have been trained not to by society at large and ostracized and often punished when they have done so, since they were tiny children. Still, men cry.If you believe the stereotypes, then you’re more like a man than a woman. But the stereotypes are false and cannot be believed and thus whatever is bothering you about your behavior cannot be explained by sexist stereotypes.You mentioned that you do not cry when hurt but instead become angry. I’ve always taught my students and clients that anger is the “cheapest” of all emotions. When in a highly charged emotional state the cheapest emotion to reveal is anger. Cheapest, meaning that anger does not reveal vulnerability. Showing hurt, in any form, reveals vulnerability. You are telling the very person who has hurt you, exactly what works.Keep in mind, that when someone has hurt you it may have been intentionally or unintentionally. Intent is very important. It is often considered by the law when deciding guilt or deciding which criminal charges will be filed. We should not react equally to those who hurt us. We must first decide if the hurt we feel was the intention of the person who hurt us. We should also try to decide if the hurt we feel is legitimate. In other words, I am hurt but should I be? All of these factors and many more must be considered.If we had the customary hours in counseling, I believe that I could bring clarification to the points that I bring up in this answer. With time, I believe that you and I would both agree. We can’t do that over the Internet but you can find a local counselor who should be able to help you find the answers you seek. Good luck, my friend. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am trying to figure out if certain problem I am currently experiencing is social phobia, paranoia, or it is something serious like schizophrenia. It started when I (age 26) went on a trip to Europe with my brother and I got a terrible flu, and on our tour bus I began having a psychosis. I thought I could hear the whole bus talking about me being stupid and ugly. Even outside where we couldn’t find people from our tour bus, I heard them talking about me, it freaked me out so much I had to ask my brother if he could hear it too , which he said no. I did have a high fever so that could have explained what was happening, but even after that occurrence there are times, not every day, I go out and I feel like I can hear people calling me ugly and stupid, or if they are laughing I think they are laughing at me. I moved to the city and I rarely want to go out because I’m afraid I will have an episode again. My boyfriend knows when I have these episodes because I become quiet and disoriented. That is because I try to listen to peoples conversations and find out if I’m going crazy or they are talking about me. Also, I do not hear voices when I am alone but only when there are people around talking so I do not know if it is because I keep mishearing or interpreting the wrong way. I am worried and not sure if I need to seek help from a therapist. Thank you for your help. I would like to add that I do not take any medications or drugs. [/INST]  Your psychosis may have been the result of your high fever. That experience was frightening and caused great anxiety. You now seem to be living in fear of it happening again.Your hyper-focus on that one event is likely contributing to your current state of anxiety. You “feel like” people are heckling you but you don’t actually hear them. In that case, fear may be the problem, not psychosis.Seeing a therapist would be a wise decision. A therapist can review the events causing you distress and determine if your thinking is realistic. Counseling can also teach you more effective coping skills for handling your anxiety.Choose a therapist who specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is an effective treatment for anxiety disorders. Medication might be helpful but it may not be necessary. That is something you can review with your therapist. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have had problems with depression for roughly 5 years. For a few months I have been bulimic and I am trying to hard to fix myself. My mother is a full time nurse and has a life of her own so i don’t see her very often. Once I thought very seriously about suicide (not a current issue) and she told me it was simply because I was a teenager. Similar response to when I confided in her and told her I was suffering from depression and bulimia. My older brother overheard though and had a very serious talk with me, saying he was very worried and urged me to not rely on my mother and seek help on my own. He has since moved away. My father lives a long way away and when he found out I was feeling depressed he told me I had no reason to as I had so much. Which made me feel very guilty and isn’t the first time I have had that thought about my depression. When my friend told her mother she was feeling depressed she got help, and both her mother and mine were very worried about her and told her she always had their support. I am glad that she is receiving care but I still felt very upset about the care and attention she was receiving from my mother when I was not. I have tried to fix myself many times, sometimes with short lived results. I am beginning to feel the effects of bulimia: stomach pains, sore throat etc. The effects are not serious or life threatening but if I can I want to live without them. I want to be healthy and happy but I don’t know how or if I deserve it. [/INST]  First and foremost, you deserve to be healthy and happy. Please, never forget that.You stated that the effects of bulimia are “not serious or life-threatening” at this time. I would disagree. The fact that you are experiencing physical symptoms is a sign that the bulimia is serious and ultimately may be life-threatening. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of all mental illnesses. They are very serious and require prompt treatment.Sometimes parents may deny that their child is experiencing mental health problems because they’re unclear about how to handle the situation. Perhaps that is why your mother is reacting the way that she is. If that is the case, you need to make it clear to her that your symptoms are real. This can be done in several ways.The most efficient way is to be honest and straightforward. Request that your mother take you to a mental health professional and inform her that you would like the same type of care that your friend received. If she is unwilling to assist you in receiving professional help, then write her a letter detailing all of your symptoms, or speak to a school faculty member or a trusted relative.I’m sorry that you are experiencing these problems. I hope you are able to get the help that you desire. A good first step is knowing that help is necessary. Your current challenge is making that clear to your mother. Be persistent and never doubt that you deserve help. It won’t be easy but your health and happiness is worth the effort. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Ever since i was young, I’ve had brutal homicidal fanaticise. All i think about is killing. It can be kids, adults, dogs, i don’t care. It’s a sick joy. I’ve hurt animals before and i would again. I don’t want power or control, i didn’t have a traumatising childhood and I’m a happy person. I get depressed and anxious when i think about it and don’t do anything for a long time I’ll lay in bed for days and just feel numb or anxious. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to tell my parents in order to get help. I collect knives so they’ll probably take them away. I don’t have any friends or anyone i can trust. No one knows i feel this way. I don’t feel angry, I’m not at all a serious person, i just laugh at horror movies or when im in pain. I can’t keep waiting in alley ways waiting for cats to kill i need something. It’s just getting worse. I’m 16 and want to wait til I have my own place until I do anything. Otherwise ill most likely be caught. I’ve thought out ways to get away with it for years. I can control myself now but I don’t think I will be able to for ever. What should I do? [/INST]  You recognize that you have a problem but refuse to seek help for it. That would suggest that you are okay with killing animals to satiate your homicidal fantasies. Most people find the idea of killing abhorrent. They would not enjoy thinking about it and would never kill unless they were forced to, in a self-defense situation. You both think about it and do it. You have an emotional reaction to it (depression and anxiety) but it is not enough to stop you from doing it or to convince you to seek help for it.When you recognize that a problem exists, you should seek help. That is the responsible course of action. It’s especially important to seek help for a problem that puts lives in danger. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the top federal law enforcement agency in the United States, recently increased the legal penalties for people who hurt animals. They consider it a “crime against humanity.” They also recognize that people who kill animals might eventually kill people. Research has shown that killing animals is often a precursor to killing people.Regarding your parents, you don’t have to discuss or even mention your homicidal fantasies. You could say that you would like to meet with a counselor to discuss your depression and anxiety issues. That would be a perfectly reasonable request. Many teenagers struggle with depression and anxiety.You are in control of your impulses and urges, but as you correctly noted, there may come a time when you lose control. At that point, you might do something that leads to serious legal problems for you. For people whose conscience is not enough to stop them from killing, the societal solution is incarceration for life or death by execution. You are putting your own life at risk by refusing to seek treatment.As I see it, you are at a crossroads. One road involves your seeking mental health treatment which could positively alter your life course. The other road involves more violence and suffering. The only wise and moral choice is treatment. Any other choice would be a mistake, resulting in far-reaching, negative consequences for you. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Is there a list available of character traits, habits and/or actions which would indicate in a general sense a psychological issue? ie: The person never shows embarrassment. The person hoards candy in the dresser drawers, under the bed, etc. The person is moody: sometimes depressed, angry, sulks or broods. The person never accepts responsibility or blame for wrongdoing but always blames others for whatever happens. If a glass is knocked over and spills or breaks, “it fell”. The person is slightly dyslexic, especially with numbers. Once the idea for a specific item wanted is in mind, that item will be had, no matter how much time elapses; it is not forgotten. The person does not tell jokes and rarely laughs at the humor of others. Most often the person does not understand the punchline of a joke. The person often acts as a victim. ie: purchases the wrong product because the correct one was out of stock, will be nearly driven off the road because will not use the horn, etc. In speech the person often attaches 2 totally/nearly unrelated phrases together using the word “but”. There is nothing perfect; there is something wrong/negative in everything/everyone. Nearly always there is some minor ailment: a pain here, ache there, headache, bellyache, blurry vision, etc., seemingly in contrast/competition to others who are experiencing serious medical conditions ie: hip replacement, cancer, etc. The person does not seem to understand limiting physical teasing such as pinching by saying,”That didn’t hurt.” or “I barely touched you.” The person wants everyone to recognize and be generous at birthday and other special times of giving but is not generous personally. Gifts are often not age related/appropriate such as giving a small child-sized gift to an older adolescent or teenager. The person prefers to use the walk-in bank lobby vs the drive thru because it “makes them feel important.” The person is not a deep thinker, does not have plans for nor talks about desires for the future. The person does not stay on task well and seems to be easily distracted from the task at hand. The aforementioned are quirks to the negative. The person has many positive characteristics as well, however, that is for another discussion. Thanks. (From Guatemala) [/INST]   Thank you for your email. The difficulty with offering feedback is that the age and gender of the person is not included in your description, and both would be important for some accurate feedback and direction. That being said, I am struck by the fact that these descriptions all sound like they are coming from a young child, yet, if they were they wouldn’t be seen as so deviant. This leads me to the thought that this person may be chronologically older than his or her actions.I would recommend an evaluation by a clinical psychologist skilled in testing and evaluation on an individual’s developmental level. I believe that would give you information to help understand what is going on.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, I’m 17-year old girl. I’ve been experiencing a slight incest-ish sexual abuse. One and the first of them was by my big brother who was 18 at the time. (we have two years of age gap so I was 16) [/INST]  I imagine you are feeling guilty that you didn’t scream at him to stop. I want you to know that your reaction is common. When someone is violated by a person they trust, the response is often disbelief, bewilderment, and confusion. The perpetrator takes advantage of that. Some even then try to convince the victim that she consented to the situation because she didn’t say “no.” Some rely on the confusion of the victim to enable them to continue the abuse.You mention that the event was only the first of situations that make you uncomfortable. Please don’t let yourself minimize what’s going on. This is sexual abuse. It is not normal. It is not okay. It is not something your brother can justify by some notion that he knows better than society. Regardless of what he thinks, he lives in a society where there are social rules and laws that protect children and teens from unwanted sexual advances.The upset in the family that is likely to come from telling your parents doesn’t make you the person who “breaks the family.” Your brother already did that. How will you ever have the same relationship with him again? Why would you want to come home if you know he might be there? How will you manage to relax at home if you are ever alone with him? His actions have already changed how you feel about yourself and how you relate to him and your whole family. Your brother is unlikely to “outgrow” his attitude. The consequences of what he’s done won’t just go away if ithe problem is ignored.Your parents can’t help you – or your brother – if they don’t know there is a problem. You owe it to yourself to turn to the parents who love you to tell them what’s been happening. You need support. He needs psychological help. Your family needs to heal.If you are having difficulty talking to your parents, it might be helpful to share your letter and this response with them as a way to begin. Tell them that I strongly urge you all to get involved with some family therapy to help you manage the situation.It makes me terribly sad and angry that you’ve been dealing with this for over a year.

"<s>[INST] I am a married woman of 24 years with 3 grown children.  I have had a pretty rough past and struggled with mental illness most of my life.  I grew up in a very dysfunctional violent family with an alcoholic parent.  I was abused and neglected.  I attempted suicide at the age of 17.  Through the years I buried my past and attempted to live a normal life.  I did not have an identity, I did what everyone wanted of me, and even believed the beliefs of the people around me. I was an empty shell being filled up by other people.  I had another breakdown in 1999 and attempted suicide again.  That is when I began therapy.  It took me a realy long time to open up to my therapist.  It seemed I got much worse before I got better.  I began cutting and binge eating became  a huge problem.  I had always coped with food but now it brought my weight up to 322lbs. [/INST]  What a brave women you are to have faced your past trauma and to have actively sought treatment to move toward a healthier and happier life. I can’t imagine how difficult it must be to have your therapist retire after working so hard to develop enough trust to open up and share things you’ve never shared with anyone else. It is very normal to feel lost, sad, and to grieve the loss of this therapeutic relationship, just as you would if you said goodbye to a close friend or family member. I imagine that finding a new therapist and developing that trust again is a scary thing to consider, but a necessary one.Some health problems, like diabetes, are chronic and require lifelong attention, management, and treatment, while others are acute, like strep throat, and generally require one course of antibiotics. Mental illness can be conceptualized in a similar way. Your mental health history, your history of abuse and neglect, and your psychological symptoms seem to fall in the chronic category. It is common for individuals with severe childhood abuse and neglect to be in treatment on and off throughout life to help manage the emotional and psychological consequences of the early experiences.Your continued struggles with dysfunctional thoughts, depressive symptoms, and binge eating suggest that you need to get back into therapy to maintain the progress you’ve made and to continue to develop coping skills and insight. You may in be in treatment throughout the rest of your life. If that’s what you need to continue to move forward, to manage your symptoms, and continue to create the life you want, then that is nothing to be ashamed of.  You deserve to have nurturing and support.Take good care of yourself!Julie Hanks, LCSW </s>"

"<s>[INST] My friend is obsessed with conspiracy theories to the point where It’s negatively effecting her life and disconnecting her from reality. She spends excessive amounts of time online reading about them. She was sexually abused as a child. Is there anything I can do as her friend to help nudge her back into reality and encourage interest in other pursuits? [/INST]  There is no shortage of conspiracy theories on the internet. They are immensely popular. Conspiracy theories have existed for centuries but social media has made them easier to share, particularly on platforms such as YouTube and Twitter. In fact, one former YouTube engineer claims that YouTube prioritizes conspiracy theories in their algorithms. If you watch one video, the “next up” or suggested recommendation is a similar type of video. Thus, if a person is watching a conspiracy-oriented video, the “next up” selection is likely another conspiracy-oriented video. Colloquially, some people refer to this as the “YouTube rabbit hole.”One popular conspiracy theory is that the victims of mass shootings are “crisis actors.” Jonathan Albright, a researcher at Columbia University, studied how these conspiracy theories spread on social media. It was his opinion that many popular conspiracy theories originate on YouTube. He observed that the view count for 50 of the top mass shooting related conspiracy videos was around 50 million.Another recent study by MIT researchers published in the journal Science analyzed millions of tweets between 2006 and 2017. They concluded that falsehoods (including many conspiracy theories) spread “significantly farther, faster, deeper and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information.” In other words, lies spread much faster than truth.It appears that conspiracy theories and other types of falsehoods are here to stay. The ability to think critically has always been important and more so now in the age of the internet.If you have yet to express your concerns to your friend, that would be a good place to start. She may not want to hear it or she may be open to your concerns. Hopefully, it’s the latter.Another possibility may be sharing your concerns with her family. They too might be worried. Perhaps there is someone in her family who might be able to convince her to stop.Once you’ve tried the aforementioned ideas, there’s probably little else you can do. You can’t force someone to do things they don’t want to do. You can express your concerns and make suggestions for change but beyond that, adults are free to do anything they want even if it is harmful to them.Do all you can. Express your concerns and suggest that she stop or seek help but beyond that realize that your powers are limited. You can’t control other people. No one can.Hopefully your friend will be receptive to your advice. Good luck. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi, I came here to this site because I really don’t know what else to do. I guess I will try to explain as best I can and sincerely hope I hear back soon. So last night my best friend of 5 years claimed that he had an “epiphany” and that he had been spoken to by God. Now neither me nor him are very religious at all and it came as a shock to me. He had been texting me at various times in the day and repeating that “God loves us.” and other things he would not normally say. Concerned, I told him I was coming over to his house and he said he had something to show me that would speak to my heart. Upon exiting my car he was already outside and he embraced me and said it was good that I was there. This was the first odd instance of a situation that began to snowball out of control. I followed him into his house and he sat me down. He began again ranting about God and his love for us. He then pulled up a video from the internet that detailed various parts of the book of revelations and conspiracies about the “illuminati” He would not stop ranting and he was beginning to frighten me. I disagreed with his many theories though I listened whole heartedly to each one. He began calling me “Satan” and would not stop going on and on about “the end times” and was spouting various philosophical and religious non-senses. The look in his eyes was so terrifying, like a wild animal, caged and afraid. He ran away from me and locked himself in his bathroom and took 2 showers and a bath. When he came out I discovered that he had taken a bible into the bath with him and submerged it. He claimed that he was baptizing himself. After this he simply broke down to complete tears. He would say “Oh my God. You’ve been here the whole time.” over and over to me. I laid him on the bed and held his hand while he drifted from laughter to paranoia and fear to a seeming state of bewilderment. Reading him scriptures from another bible he had seemed to calm him down. It didn’t last long, as he began to refer to me as the arch-angel Gabriel, saying I was the messenger of God, my name coincidentally being Gabriel. He began to spout various conspiracy theories ranging from being poisoned by the illuminati to Obama being the anti-christ. I was terrified by his inane ramblings so I took him to the ER. I was convinced he had taken a hard drug of some sort or perhaps some hallucinogen. He was terrified of everyone and especially the dark. He felt that the darkness outside would pervade his body and send him to hell. Doctors weraing dark blue scrubs would also terrify him and his eyes would become large and he would attempt to run. After getting him to cooperate they took a sample of his blood and urin to test for drug use. No drugs were found in his system. He was still very emotionally unstable and was constantly saying nonsensical things. He has since been admitted to a psychiatric ward. They have no solid answers for his sudden insanity. They said it could be anything from dehydration to schizophrenia to bi-polar disorder to depression. All I know for certain is this one day he simply snapped. The person I know has seemingly disappeared. I still have no answers. I am so terrified that I’ve lost him and he’s never coming back. I believe he may have schizophrenia due to his symptoms. (paranoia, delusions of grandeur, mood swings, etc) He has never shown any symptoms like this before. As I said, he simply went insane. I don’t know what to do anymore and am very frightened. Please, I need some answers. [/INST]  Your friend may have had a psychotic break. Psychosis is associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression with psychotic features, among others. There are occasions when an individual has one psychotic episode and never another. Clinically, that’s referred to as schizophreniform disorder. It’s too soon to know if he has any of the aforementioned disorders.People do not typically “snap.” It’s rare. In typical cases of psychosis, there are definitive signs leading up to the episode. It’s unclear whether you were in contact with your friend before his episode. Perhaps the early signs were missed.You correctly suspected illicit drug use as a possible explanation. Despite testing negative, drug use could have contributed to his psychosis. Perhaps he ingested a short-acting drug. For instance, an occasional cocaine user might only test positive for several days after use. It is also possible that he had an adverse reaction to prescription medication. Certain prescription drugs such as steroids and stimulants can cause psychosis. Alcohol use and alcohol withdrawal can both cause psychosis.Other medical conditions that can cause psychosis include stroke, epilepsy, brain tumors or cysts, and certain brain diseases including Parkinson’s or Huntington’s disease.Thankfully, he is receiving psychiatric care in a hospital setting. That is the best place for him. The psychiatric staff are constantly monitoring his symptoms to determine the best course of treatment. You made the correct choice when you took him to a hospital. He is lucky to have you as a friend.It’s unclear what happened to your friend. Perhaps there will be clarification upon his discharge. In the meantime, try to be supportive. Experiencing psychosis is frightening. Visit him in the hospital and let him know that you’ll assist him in any way that you can. Hopefully, such an episode will never happen again. Please keep me posted on his recovery. Don’t hesitate to write again with additional questions. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in Hong Kong: Since the beginning of secondary school, I’ve been noticing that I’ve been feeling more down. And I also experienced an increase in anxiety. I’ve always been an anxious kid, but this increased and now it has reached to the point where sometimes I can’t eat in public much. Since I am dealing with overweight issues, i feel like anything everyone will be thinking why I’m eating even though I’m fat already. My family don’t understand this, they keep on eating outside while I just want to go home. [/INST]  Your letter is only a reflection of how you feel. It’s a “mess” because you feel like a “mess”. You are so discouraged about the possibility of making changes that you are giving up on yourself — even more than your friends have. Generally, teenagers don’t hang around with someone just because they feel “bad” for them. It’s more likely they like you but are as discouraged as you are about how to help you.I agree with you. Some professional help would probably be helpful. But only if you are honest with your feelings. We therapists only have what people tell us to go on. If you do decide to see someone, please take this letter and response with you and share it. Doing so will help the therapist quickly get to your issues and be more helpful.It might also be a good idea for you to share your letter with your mother as a way to help her understand how seriously discouraged you really are.If seeing a professional isn’t possible, please look into joining a support group here at PsychCentral. Go to the “Find Help” tab on the home page. Then click on the “forums and support groups”. You will probably find a group of people who can offer you support and practical advice.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been in love with one guy for the past 8 years. We also had a 3 yr long distance relationship. But we made it through all odds and are now going to get married by end of this year. But during my long distance, I met another guy and I fell in love with him. We ended it within a couple of months because he is married. But even after 2 years, I still have feelings for him and he has expressed his love several times and is willing to leave his wife. I am confused what I should do. I think I love both of them. I cant hurt my to-be husband and our families but I also feel I will have a better life with the other. I know this is very selfish of me but I am really torn apart, so please help. [/INST]  This isn’t so much selfish as it is a struggle with genuine intimacy. You fell in love with one man that was a long-distance relationship, unavailable by geography. Then you fell in love with another man who was unavailable because of his marriage. You are likely not to be in love with each man as he is, but rather in love with his potential.The man you are engaged to is now becoming more available. You have worked though the rough spots and now are on the threshold of becoming an intimate couple.A struggle with intimacy means the more available a person becomes, the more difficult it will be for you to make the commitment. This is my best guess as to what has happened. If I am right about this, then swapping out one man for the other in the name of love is not likely to yield a true change in your capacity to tolerate intimacy.The married man and your fiancé create the same dynamic inside of you. You want and cannot fully have either.Do not worry about hurting feelings, being selfish, or trying to do the right thing. Concern yourself with coping with the internal feeling of wanting and not having. The source of your dilemma is most likely coming from a dynamic originating inside you that developed from unresolved issues.I would make an appointment with a therapist. Our find help tab would be a resource for finding one in your area.In the meantime I will encourage you to read the book Dance of Intimacy, a classic in the field that might shed more light on this process for you.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: Very long story short, I just recently found out that I have another child with a woman I dated a very long time ago. The little girl is a pre-teen years old, the mother was not sure who’s child it was. the man who is on the birth certificate is the only one the child has known as her dad. [/INST]  You are asking very important questions. Your focus on what is best for the child, not on the interests of all the adults involved, is appropriate and admirable. Your wife deserves lots of credit for understanding that having a relationship with this love child in no way threatens her or the children you have had together. There is always enough love to go around if people are loving.In general, secrets in families are toxic. They have a way of eventually surfacing and causing a great deal of pain. My vote is to follow your instincts and to tell the little girl the truth, reinforcing that you in no way want to diminish her relationship with the father she’s known.Be clear with the child’s mother that you are interested in doing this to help the child. The child deserves to know about the medical facts. She also deserves to know the truth about her own identity. Be clear that you are not interested in helping the mom manage any bad feelings she has about her ex.I do think the other man should also be told. It’s inevitable that he will find out. It’s better to be in control of revealing the information than to have it come out either in anger by his ex or as a slip from the girl. It would be helpful if the two of you could have a face to face conversation about the situation. You don’t have to be new best friends. But you do need to agree that neither of you will ever speak critically about the other to the child. It’s also wise to agree that there is nothing to be gained by getting into conversations about the child’s mother. The focus should only be on how you can both help this little girl grow up healthy and strong.With care, your introduction into her life expands the universe of love and support for this little girl. There is no reason for her to have to “choose” a dad. She can have and enjoy the love of two men in her life.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I live a pretty normal life.. i wake up go to school like any other person my age.. but i think i have a serious problem.. at first i thought it was my imagination, then when it got worse over the years i started to worry. i live in an imaginary world.. where i am Ashley.. a SUPERSTAR with the perfect life, perfect friends and perfect husband..

Ashley is by my side right now watching me type this… i feel trapped.. please help [/INST]  Sometimes, people will create an imaginary world when they are experiencing distress in their lives. It’s much easier to live in an imaginary world when one’s reality is painful. It’s a form of escapism. Some people are also prone to fantasies.You seem to have difficulty, at least on some occasions, distinguishing reality from non-reality. You have an emotional reaction to events that happen in your imaginary world. It’s not healthy, and it’s a sign of a potential problem, when you feel trapped or feel that you no longer know what is real. The fantasy world is also preventing you from developing relationships. It’s hurting you.It was wise to have made this inquiry about a potential psychological issue. My recommendation would be to see a therapist. It’s important to stay grounded in reality and a therapist can assist you with this. A therapist can also analyze why it is that you feel more comfortable in the fantasy world than in the real world. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi, I’m sixteen years old and a male. I’ve been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder since age 13. Also, I have used numerous drugs, alcohol, self-harmed, contemplated/attempted suicide twice, I don’t eat or treat myself very well, have critically low self esteem, etc. I’m living with my mother and older brother, they both express concern with me. I sleep too much, and have had to switch to online high school due to sleep issues. I used to do well in school, but now I have no motivation to do anything. I have things I enjoy doing, but I don’t enjoy them like I used to. My mother feels like she is an inconsistent parent, and I think that she tried to make up for it by punishing me harshly for every slip-up. It makes my quality of life much worse. I like the thought of suicide, although I don’t plan on it. Help? [/INST]  You stated that you been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety but have you received treatment? The fact that you continue to experience symptoms indicates that if you are receiving treatment, it’s not working. You also mentioned suicide but don’t have a specific plan to end your life. Any thoughts of suicide, even in the absence of a plan, are concerning. Your family is concerned about you and rightly so. By your own admission, you are not well.It’s imperative that you seek mental health treatment. Ask your mother if she would be willing to have you evaluated. A mental health professional could determine what may be wrong but more important, develop an appropriate treatment plan to deal with your symptoms.You may also consider family therapy, a type of therapy that includes your family in treatment. You mentioned that your mother is an “inconsistent parent” and is contributing to your unhappiness. Family therapy could address that problem directly. You can suggest this type of therapy to your mother and or the mental health evaluator, who could advise you about how to access family therapy.In the meantime, try to improve your self-care. Not eating, depriving your body of the nutrients it needs to function properly, is likely contributing to your emotional instability. Your body needs food to survive and without it you will not feel well physically or psychologically.You also mentioned that you don’t “treat yourself very well.” You’re using illegal drugs and alcohol and engaging in self-harm. The use of drugs and alcohol can also significantly increase your distressing symptoms. Alcohol is a nervous system depressant and can intensify your depression. Drugs and alcohol alter one’s mood. The initial ingestion of drugs or alcohol may seem to improve your mood but it does not last. Drugs and alcohol alter your brain chemistry and ultimately complicate mood disorders. Avoid all drugs and alcohol.Finally, self-harm is a form of self-destruction. When people engage in self-harm, it usually means that they lack important problem-solving skills. The most efficient way to learn these important life skills is through the assistance of a mental health professional.I hope you will take my advice. Speak to your mother about seeing a mental health professional and do what is necessary to receive treatment as soon as possible. Don’t ignore your suicidal thoughts and go to the hospital if you feel you might be a danger to yourself or someone else. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m always worried about having a heart attack. I even had a catheterization 5 years ago. The cardiologist told me there was nothing wrong with my heart and he wished he had my arteries. Since this was one of the best diagnostic heart tests, I thought that my fears would stop. I felt as though I had faced my greatest fear and it would go away. I forgot to add that I’ve been worrying about my heart since I was 20-years-old. The fear has not gone away and I wanted to know if you have any suggestions to help me. 48 years is a long time to be afraid. I do meditation, yoga and I try to walk 2 miles at least five days. I haven’t done this for about two months because I twisted my ankle and am now afraid to start again. My ekg’s are always normal. I see a psychiatric nurse once a month. [/INST]  The most efficient way to overcome a phobia is to believe in reality. All phobias are, by definition, irrational fears. Irrational fear is kept “alive” when one doesn’t believe in reality. In your circumstance, you learned through a variety of medical tests that your heart is healthy, yet you simply don’t believe it. It is as though you are rejecting these objective tests. That’s akin to rejecting reality, rejecting your doctor’s educated opinion, rejecting the laboratory results and established medical science.The farther one moves away from believing in what is real, the more psychologically unhealthy one becomes. Delusions are the ultimate irrational fear. Delusions are strongly held beliefs that exist despite evidence to the contrary. Do your best to try to believe in the truth. Forcing yourself to believe in the truth can preserve your psychological health.In your case, reality, science and medical testing says that your heart is healthy. Scientific tests have proven that to be true. Believe in science. If you believe in science, then your fears will subside. If you refuse to believe the objective tests (i.e. reject science), then your anxiety will continue.Perhaps underlying all of this is a fear of death. All people will die. Death is inevitable. We live between the moments of birth and death. How you live between these moments determines your quality of life. Being afraid of death, to the point where it decreases your quality of life, is akin to having died already or having been cheated out of life.The idea of forcing oneself to believe in reality takes practice. For many people, it’s a new way of thinking. Therapy could greatly assist you in acquiring this new way of thinking. If this continues to be an issue, and is degrading your quality of life, then consider counseling. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Australia: My sister in law, who currently lives in Canada, has been diagnosed with a psychological disorder. She seems to have been tipped into delusional thinking 12 months ago when her ex husband filed divorce proceedings. She has always had OCD and paranoid tendencies but never delusional as she is now. [/INST]  Sadly, this may have to get worse before it gets better. You’ve already done what I would suggest. As you already discovered, this can’t be handled long distance by phone and email. It needs people’s presence and persistence. But you did that with your visits. She also may need more time in a hospital to stabilize her medications and to establish the value of therapy. But she has already had one such stay.It may require another crisis — and another hospitalization — to give you some leverage with her. In this sense, it might be more helpful for her husband to move ahead with his plans than to continue to try to reason with her. His gentle approach has inadvertently helped her remain convinced that he doesn’t mean it.While she is in hospital, you could request a family meeting to learn more about her state of mind and to ask for advice about how best to support her. My hope is that such a meeting would persuade her to return to your country where she has on-going support. But she may not agree to do that.I don’t know enough about Canadian law to advise you about whether there is anything you can do to compel her to accept treatment and go where she is loved and cared for. In your shoes, I would check with a lawyer to see.Meanwhille, you are in the very difficult position of having to watch someone you love self-destruct. There’s nothing I can say to make that any easier. If there is a support group in your area for relatives of people who are mentally ill, I do urge you to attend. Such groups often provide both information and emotional support that are helpful.I wish you well.  </s>"

When I am with the only friend I am allowed hang out with, my cousin would not leave us alone until I finally snapped and yelled at him. [/INST] It seems to me that this is between your friend and his girlfriend. He must be very in love with her or okay with her behavior (or both) or he wouldn’t be continuing the relationship.

"<s>[INST] I have a big problem with dealing with my in laws. Actually, my boyfriend and me is getting along together for over 7years. There was no problem with my in laws at early years. But the problem began when I started studying abroad. Actually, my BF’ cousin, my sis in law, went to study BBA and she came back because she couldn’t study even the Foundation of Business English Class, not the Credit courses. But for me, I went to study MBA and I am OK with my studying. We went to the different countries and universities. At first I thought there was nothing concerning between my studying and hers. But unfortunately, she extremely jealous and gossiping about me in her relations. Although she is first cousin to my BF, their families lived together and they are like siblings. Especially, my BF’ mom love her like her own daughter. That’s the main point. My mother in law believe and accept whatever she and her own family said. Not only her, but also her mom hate me when I start studying abroad. She even talk and insult about my personality and character. For example, at the early months I went studying abroad, she and her family said ‘she cant study long coz she is not qualified’. But when I am ok with my studying, they said ‘she will become worse than a sexual worker and will cheat my bro cousin’ (yeah, they said even like that). But, when I am perfect with my personality, they (she and her family) said, ‘Ah! Nothing happened? Yeah. Because she is abnormal now coz she live alone without her family’. When my sis in law tried to study abroad, both and her family moved. The main problem is that my BF’ mother believe and talked to me very very badly starts from over 1year ago.(She talked to me like a street dog). At the first time, I couldn’t even talk back a word to her because I was so surprise as we had a good relation. She did for twice but thanks for God, its a phone conversation and I drop the phone and never called her again. (But, now she pretend to be a good one whenever by boyfriend is with her and she said ‘I never said like that’ ) That jealous girl always tried to separate my BF and me with so many ways. I cant stand what they do. Coz they always talk about me badly to my BF, their relations and friends. As for me, I cant stand even a minute about that because my improving career is not like stealing her brain and her life. Hers is hers and mine is mine. Start from there, I have been always angry with them. Like they stole my time by thinking about their nonsense gossip and insulting. Although my BF support me, I am not relieve of that. I often cried out suddenly and fight to my BF by telling about them but he never fight me back. He just say ‘Its not me Honey. Its them. Sorry for I cannot control them. But I will love you forever and will be more good to you’. I don’t like this feeling. I had my peaceful life. I really miss my sound and peace past. I do hate them. But I also hate that feeling. I want to live without thinking them. I want to live peacefully whenever they have their family special occasions because I have to always worrying that whether they forced my BF to marry other girl (like they always do)or not and tell that how bad is my university and career and how bad is my personality. I want to conquer them and my bad feeling. I do want to conquer them. On the other hand, I want to be in better place (education and personality)to make them more and more jealous. But this feeling drive me away and away from my peaceful life. I don’t know how to handle them and my feeling. Please help me. [/INST]  It is time to get your boyfriend involved more directly and have him deal with his family directly. He is too passive and you need more direct support from him. It is true he cannot control them, but he can explain how disappointed he is in them, how it is both disrespectful and unacceptable to treat you this way. Your accomplishments need to be a source of pride, not the target of jealousy. The only reason you have to put up with them is because of your relationship with your boyfriend. It is time for him to stand with you and support you and confront his family.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am a 18 year old male who is very confused about what I want to do with my life. I honestly have no idea what I want to do nor a small hint of what I want to do. I recently dropped out of my first year of college because I really did not like what i was doing and now want to have a gap year to try to find what I want to do. Just today i found out what my dad really thinks of me. Which really hurt me. He believes I’m going no where in my life and is disappointed in what I am turning into. I have little motivation and I somehow can not get motivated no matter how i try it doesn’t work for me. With my father we never really connected but i never knew he felt that way. i dont know it just really hurts when my father says he’s disappointed in what I am. I also am very scared of my future and i just want to know what is right for me and i cant find it. I would love to have advise on how to deal with these situations. Mostly on making a better relationship with my father and on what to do with my future. [/INST]  Thank you for writing. It’s possible that part of what is going on between you and your dad is generational. When he was 18, he probably didn’t feel he had the choice to be floundering. He just had to work. It’s hard for him to understand that you are more typical of your age group than not. It’s an unusual 18-year-old these days who is certain about what they want to do with their life.The other issue that stands between you is that your dad is worried about you. He may not express it in the best way but I suspect he just wants to know that you’re going to be okay. It’s an occupational hazard for parents.My suggestion is this: Do something. Almost anything. Any job you take will help you figure out what you do and don’t want to do with your life. You may find elements in the job that feel right and you may not. But you will get more information. Then try something else. As you gain experience with different options, it will start to become clear where your interests and talents lie. And don’t tell me you’re not motivated. You don’t have to be. All you have to do is get started. Sitting in your confusion isn’t going to give you any new information. Trying some things out will.Once you get a job, let your dad know that you are as concerned as he is and that you are taking steps to figure it out. Tell him that his support in the project means a great deal to you. Invite him to talk with you about what you learn about each job. Once he sees you actively working on taking care of yourself, he’ll be more able to be supportive.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve noticed for a while that i have a depression but didnt go to a therapist yet. This is because i only made bad experiences with psychologists so far, i had an anorexia when i was 16, probably it wasnt a real anorexia, i didnt completly stop eating, i just wanted to be thin and kind of liked the feel and just didnt stop eating a little less calories than you’d need. Before my parents even taked to me or anyone told me, they send me to a psychologist and wanted to force me to go to a clinic, which meant a whole change of my live, id have to leave my home for a year, i was so shocked and even considerd killing myself. So now im super scared to ever go again to a psychologist. [/INST]  Yes, therapy can help immensely. It’s all about finding the right therapist. It didn’t go well with your last psychologist but they’re not all the same. It’s not uncommon for people to try multiple therapists before they find the one they like and who is able to help them.The tone of your letter is pessimistic. That’s understandable, since you seem depressed. You’re also minimizing your suffering. For instance, you say that your father beating you is “not a huge issue.” Of course it is. It’s abusive and also illegal. By minimizing this issue it’s almost like saying “I’m not important.” Feeling unworthy is also a sign of depression.Many teenagers are suffering with serious psychological problems but feel as though they can’t ask their parents for help. They’re embarrassed or believe that their parents will refuse their request for treatment. Then there are others who have asked their parents to take them to a therapist and were devastated when they said no. You have the opposite problem. Your parents took you to treatment when you didn’t want to go. It wasn’t pleasant but you survived the experience. What’s fortunate about your situation is that your parents are willing to take you to a therapist. It means you have the opportunity to be helped whereas other people may not.Utilize the help that is offered to you. I typically advise people to interview at least four or five therapists before they make a decision. Inquire about their successes with past clients, how they think they could help you and choose the one with whom you feel the most comfortable. Ask your parents to assist you in this process.You feel as though there is no hope for you but really there is a great deal of hope for you. Many people think they can’t be helped but they’re wrong. I have witnessed how helpful therapy can be. Try a new therapist. If it’s not successful continue searching until you find a therapist you like. Be persistent. It will be worth your effort. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Ten months ago I met my girlfriend(now-ex), it wasn’t love at first sight or anything like that, but I did fall in love with her 2-3 months later. In her defense, she did tell me that she was bipolar, however it was not a mild case as she told me. She was the sweetest person, made me feel like I was the king of the world for the first 3 months. [/INST]  In every relationship both parties have to agree that the relationship will continue. If one person votes no, then the relationship is over. Your ex, by not responding to your attempts at contacting her, is essentially voting no. This is important to understand. You cannot force someone to be in a relationship with you.It is important to explore your motivation for wanting to continue this relationship. It seems as though you are interested in wanting to “fix” her. No one can be fixed. An individual has to want help and is responsible for making the changes that are necessary. In addition, you can’t be both her boyfriend and her therapist. Many people have tried this approach in relationships and it always ends in failure. Only a trained mental health professional is in the position to treat your girlfriend. Also, as a partner it is not your job to “fix” your significant other. Love cannot cure mental illness.Another consideration is that your ex is currently symptomatic and may not be capable of a healthy relationship. You seem at some level to understand this fact but are unwilling to accept it. You’re still attempting to pursue a relationship with someone that you admittedly know is currently incapable of being in a healthy relationship. The question becomes why.My general advice is that this does not seem as though it is a healthy relationship to pursue. Perhaps it could be in the future, when and if she receives intensive treatment and becomes stable. Counseling can help you to understand your emotions and responsibilities.

"<s>[INST] My twin identifies as transgender nonbinary, and is biologically female. They are recovering from anorexia (very underweight) and body dysmorphic disorder, as well as depression and hints of bipolar disorder but are acting selfish, cruel, irrational, entitled. This has been happening for about two years, and my parents have been very transphobic and controlling of my twin, constantly fretting over them to eat more and act more “girlish”, as they wish to “return” their physical image and behaviors to their original biological sex. I am their twin, their closest friend and confidant, and we know so much about each other than we can literally finish each other’s sentences and basically read each other’s minds. I can tell when they are upset even if their face expression changes a tiny bit. This is the problem — our closeness. [/INST]  I’m so sorry that you both are going through this. It must be very difficult. I know that twins share a special bond that most of us don’t come close to understanding, so I appreciate your position. However, sharing a bond — and even DNA — does not make you responsible for someone else. It appears that you have tried to be understanding and compassionate, but your twin is starting to take advantage of this and it is beginning to hurt.It seems that your twin is truly struggling with multiple mental health issues, so their pain is real, but it is not your job to fix it. Being transgendered is difficult enough and your twin also suffers from several other serious problems. Your twin needs professional help. If they are already seeing a therapist I might suggest that you ask to go to a few sessions so that you can share your experience of what is happening. Furthermore, even if you do this, it might be helpful for you to also see someone on your own, especially considering that you may be going off to college. Dealing with a separation of this nature could be hard on you both. You may also need some help in setting healthy boundaries and knowing when to speak up and when to let things go. You shouldn’t have to be crying in the shower! Please reach out for help and remember that loving someone does not make you responsible for them.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] I took a drug called LSD, a psychedelic drug and I “came out” on it, I hope you know what it means, and it causes my anxiety level to went sky high during the “trip” I sort of “died” during the trip and came back, I wasn’t really the drug type of person but somehow my friends manage to convinced me, I’ll tried to keep and it brief and short, even thought friends who were not present during my drugs experience I never contacted any friends from that incident ever since, I wouldn’t know what they think about me and I’m afraid to even think about, they may be okay for who I am or not, I don’t know, I think they would probably be okay, it’s just me that I’m not, suicide is surely not the answer because I can’t do that to my family, and I decided that I’m lucky enough to get the chance to come to Australia for further studies, and also to “escape” my past, ever since I feel that I talk to people with a “filter”, like I won’t reveal my inner true feelings, just very blunt, I am open, but overtime it has become something that I just am, I would talk, but that’s all, I talk, and this made my friends unable to be close to me and overtime become “the other guy”, and I feel friendless and lonely now, and lost in my life, don’t know how to move forward, seeking help about my past is not something I’m ready because if I do it means I have to talk about it which is hard and “face” it, which in honesty I’m afraid of what my family would think and how other people would judge me if they knew, sorry for the long post and I hope to hear from whoever, can’t thank you enough in advance. [/INST]  The work you’re talking about isn’t the past, it’s about you — right now — in your current circumstances. The LSD experience seems to have opened you to a realization in your life that is creating anxiety. You’ll want to try to integrate this feeling and realization into who you are becoming. As you are connected to a university I would highly recommend using the university’s counseling center. While it is difficult to talk about, you have displayed tremendous courage by talking about it here at PsychCentral. Follow up by bringing your concerns to a professional at the university who can help.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S: I’m a little curious. I’m 17. I have this step-dad who seems to be rather fond of me but I cannot tell if this is normal or not. Anyway, here’s the gist of it, once or twice, he asked me if I’ll be his “secret girlfriend” or something to that affect, on the top of complimenting my looks and stating how I shouldn’t hide it, stating that he wants me to be comfortable with him. I don’t bring it up because I really don’t know what to think but I do really want to know if this is normal. [/INST]  I want to be careful about making a judgment about whether your step-dad is being “normal” on the basis of only 5 sentences. What I can tell you is this: Many fathers and stepfathers find it difficult to deal with their feelings when their daughters reach the age when they are becoming physically attractive young women. They are living in the same house with a young woman who reminds them of what it was life to be young themselves and who looks like someone they might have wanted to date when they were teens. Their feelings of attraction are normal. But here’s the important thing: Responsible fathers, stepdads, grandfathers and other male relatives understand to their core that their job is to protect the young women in their families. This means keeping clear boundaries themselves, and it means making sure that others do the same. They would never act on their feelings and often feel terrible that they even have them. They understand that maintaining a loving and safe relationship with you is part of what prepares you to eventually find someone to love who loves and respects you.Your step-dad may think he is only complimenting you. But I completely understand why it weirds you out when he talks about wanting you to be his “secret girlfriend.” The fact that he says it should be secret underlines that on some level he knows he is being inappropriate. It is inappropriate. Instead of making you more comfortable, he is doing the opposite. You justifiably want to keep your distance.It is absolutely okay for you to tell him that he is making you uncomfortable and that you want to be treated as a daughter, not as a girlfriend. But the responsibility for maintaining clear boundaries shouldn’t rest on you. If he keeps it up, tell your mother what he is saying to you and ask her to have a talk with him about the importance of being a safe adult male in your life. I hope he shows himself to be a quality guy by apologizing to you and your mother and never, ever making such comments again.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  Me and my husband got married 4 months ago after living together 2 years on his home country. I am from latin america,he is from europe. 6 months ago he started a new job, and in his office, the majority of colleagues are women. For two months already, he began developing a good relationship with some of them, specially with 3 women. Now,they go for drinks sometimes after work, and I am having trouble accepting this. [/INST]  I have a feeling that the problem isn’t just about drinks after work. You are newly married. You left your home country and you are trying to adjust to his. Your own network of friends and family is far away. Maybe you are trying to manage in a language other than your own as well. It’s a lot to handle. It makes sense to me that you may want more time and attention from your husband and that maybe you are a bit clingy.You are right that forbidding him to see his colleagues is a mistake. Continuing to fight about his after-work activities is only going to make him resentful. I think you are getting more and more upset because you two are not talking about the more important issues that are underneath the main problem.I suggest you sit down with your husband and tell him how much he means to you. Share with him how hard it is to adjust to a new country with new customs that are so different from your own. Let him know that you are not really a jealous person. But right now you need him more than maybe either of you would like. Ask for his help in finding other couples and friends you can both hang out with so you don’t feel so left out and alone.I hope you can get on the same team and deal with the importance of having a circle of friends that you can both enjoy – together and on your own. If you do it well, you will both feel better. You won’t feel so threatened. He won’t feel like you are constantly checking up on him.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] (I am sorry for my poor english. I have been learning it only for five years) Since I was young my only friends were allways my classmates. I talked to them only at the school and walked as far from Skype or ICQ as I could. I were with them at the school, isn’t that enough? I thought it was normal and I was just a bit shy and liked my privacy. The same goes for touches. I don’t feel the need to cling to others. I endure hugs and kisses from my family members, but that‘s the end. When my friends are sad (though I am not really able to tell, I never was a great empathy, they need to outright cry for me to notice) the most I manage is an awkward pat on shoulder. But now I have problem…well it may be a little cruel to call my boyfriend a problem, but I can’t help it. We have been dating for four months. All my friends always seemed excited, when they talked about dating. So I thought it would be worth a shot. So when HE asked me out I said yes. It was fine at first. You could call it „experimenting“. I tried the new things. Kisses, hugs and cuddling. I soon realized that I didn’t feel any of the „nice fuzzy feelings“ my friends described. For me it’s just skin-to-skin contact. But HE seems to be enjoying it. He clings to me like koala bear to tree and it REPULSES me! When I have him wrapped around me for more than five minutes I want to RIP his hands OF! I can’t even read romantic books anymore. When I know how the real things feel, I just skip all the „intimate“ chapters. Just him being around me is annoying. The other day he spent three hours wrapped around me and when he offered to walk me home I had to RUN! I couldn’t bear another minute. He says he needs to: „warm me up“ and kisses me more than normal and I want to murder him! It’s clear I don’t love him. I have never loved anyone outside family before so I can’t really tell, but I think he isn’t the ONE. But I still want to change. Someday I want children and husband. But what exactly is wrong with me? [/INST]  It sounds like you are describing your awareness of your personality and the impact on your boyfriend. This is a very powerful thing for a 16-year-old to have awakened to and I applaud you reaching out to ask this question here. Rather than see your reaction as bad or wrong, what if you are simply learning about who you are, what you need, and what you don’t want? You are learning what works for you and what doesn’t. This is a good thing. I would encourage you to be honest and talk to your boyfriend about your feelings about him. He too deserves to be with someone that meets his needs.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m a single mother and my son is 13 years old. His father and I broke up when my son was 4 years old. Since then my ex has come in and out of my sons life. He does not help me support him and he has a lot of issues. He makes my son broken promises and continues to disappoint him. I have always allowed him to be in contact with my son because i did not want to be the reason he did not talk to him. He goes months without calling him and then pops back into the picture. It hurts me to see what my sons goes through. Sometimes i take it out on my son and i know that i shouldn’t. A part of me wishes my son would stick up for himself and not allow this to happen but he does not. How should i go about handling this situation. My ex tells my son lots of excuses which pisses me off and then Im the one taking it out on my son with being angry or upset. Please help [/INST]  You are doing fine until you get to the part where you take it out on your boy. You’re right. He doesn’t deserve it. He is mistreated enough by one parent. He doesn’t need to be mistreated by his mom as well. You know your problem isn’t with the boy. It’s with your ex.The answer to your question is in two parts: For you: Find a therapist to talk to about how to manage your anger so you don’t hurt your son. You certainly have plenty to be angry about. You need to learn how to focus it. You might even be able to engage your ex in couples work for the sake of your son. If he refuses to come, therapy will give you an important place to figure out the best way to manage the situation.For your son: It’s fortunate that the extent of his dad’s mistreatment is broken promises. As painful as it is to watch, he has to deal with his own relationship with his father. Your son will figure out for himself that his father isn’t trustworthy. Don’t say anything negative about his dad. That puts him in a loyalty bind. Instead, offer him your support. That means listening to his distress without jumping in to try to fix it. It means comforting him by telling him he is a lovable kid and by reminding him that there are lots of other people who love him. It means not trying to solve the problem but instead letting him know you have confidence in his ability to make the right decisions for himself about how he wants to respond to his dad. At 13, you can’t protect him as you once could. He is on the brink of adolescence. He needs your vote of confidence.I wish you well. Dr. MarieIf you have raised your son with good values about how to treat people, you can count on those values coming through. </s>"
"<s>[INST] A lot of things have happened in my life that can be considered life changing problems for others – not me. My parents got divorced, my dad hooked up and got pregnant, I’ve had/still have to deal with my mums illness… so why does none of this bother me until I start thinking? Once I start thinking, I think about every single problem in my life and I cry. I cry myself to sleep. I’ve had thoughts of uselessness and suicide. Don’t worry – I’m way too weak to actually kill my self. I tried cutting… got too scared, failed and gave up. For some reason I like it when I get hurt by accident. I don’t know why but I feel proud even if I have a little paper cut. One time I used a weighted hula hoop and expected to get bruises but when I didn’t, I felt disappointed. Maybe I want the attention? I’m not so sure myself. [/INST]   I am so sorry you are having so many difficulties. But this isn’t paranoia. What I hear is a young woman who is persistently courageous in trying to figure out what is wrong and trying to fix it. At 14 we need someone on your side as it seems your mom and dad haven’t been much help. If I’m wrong about that (and I hope I am) ask one or both of them to take you to a therapist. If that seems too much of a stretch for them to do — or they are unwilling — ask them to take you to a physician because you are not feeling well, which is true. When you talk to the physician ask him or her to help. They can help you understand why your moods fluctuate and what you can do about it.You need an adult to help you get to the next level so it can be determined what will help. Perhaps a teacher of school guidance counselor can lead you in the right direction. If there is a family member, a grandparent or aunt that could help that would be good. The point is you did a brave thing by reaching out here and I am encouraging raging you to take the next step and reach out for an adult who can help you.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Kuwait: When I was about 12, my older brother would want to hang out and watch movies and stuff, while we were watching he would pull his penis out. He wouldn’t really do anything or try to touch me, it was just there and he just took it out. I don’t know why he did it, and he did it several times. [/INST]  There is nothing wrong with you. There is something very wrong with your brothers. I don’t know where they got the idea that it is okay to molest their little sister. I have to wonder what they have experienced that would lead them to do such a terrible thing.The reason you didn’t say anything in either situation is called the “normalcy bias”. When a person is victimized or witnesses a disaster or crime, the brain may refuse to let it in. The brain protects the person by trying to make the situation feel “normal” even though it’s not. It takes a while for the person to process what is happening and to realize that something is very, very wrong. It’s a common response to a shocking or traumatic event. It’s actually a way that people can cope with something that is emotionally overwhelming.You didn’t tell your brothers to stop because their behavior was so shocking and outside your normal expectations of how they should treat you that you couldn’t process it. You have nothing to be ashamed of. You can’t expect yourself to be prepared for something that is so unexpected and so wrong.Yes. You should tell your mother. You need her protection. You might also benefit from talking this out with a therapist in order to feel better. Your mother also needs to take steps to find out what is at the root of the problem. Your brothers are both troubled and troubling boys to be doing this kind of thing to you. They need help before they go too far with someone and commit an even more heinous crime.I’m very, very sorry you have carried any guilt for this. Really. It’s not your fault. Please do talk to your mom and think about talking with a therapist to help you get past this.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I dislike me. Currently teaching at the university, regularly teach at the high school full-time; so I’m just part timing at the moment. Working keeps me slightly “busy,” but not enough to distract me from my thoughts; every once in a while I have this thoughts of complete unsatisfaction. Last year I taught without a break (all summer + all year round school) and I felt very exhausted towards the end of teaching at the high school, I even had a couple of break points. I see a psychiatrist, she says I’m bipolar (2). I’ve tried so many many many meds that at this point, it’s pointless to continue taking them, I really want to get off them; be it uncomfortable side effects like lactating or gaining so MUCH MUCH weight — I just got off Zyprexa and lost about 6 or 7 pounds; plus, I’m not sure if it clouds my thinking, as I’ve felt that I’m just not as quick as I once was — which is the strongest reason to come off them. I also see a psychologist, but I don’t get to see her very often, mostly once a month, if not every two weeks; she says I have GAD and not bipolar. I’m just so tired that I just go by without a will or purpose to continue. It is such a dull time consuming annoyance dislike to continue; but I know there’s no reason to “off” me. I probably am too hard on myself, but I just see so many “excuses” to come up with that don’t lead me to something productive and prosperous set of achievements. I’m just SO TIRED, VERY TIRED; this is never ending. When I go see my primary physician, he will include the bipolar diagnosis, I HATE IT!!! The psychiatrist tells me she will look up for something else I can take, but I just don’t feel any relief. My primary doctor tells me he is glad that I seem to manage my work/career good enough considering, but I don’t even feel/think I’m bipolar to begin with.I guess every once in a while it seems so much more pointless that the psychiatrist recommended ECT; I know I don’t want to take lithium; even the ticks I feel, I dislike; seems as if I were to have a stroke. I don’t know what to do. [/INST]  Your dissatisfaction with life is propelling you to search for something better. This may sound counterintuitive, but that’s a good thing. You’re unwilling to tolerate unhappiness. That is a necessary prerequisite for a happy life.Your current therapy arrangement does not seem to be meeting your needs. You should either see your therapist more often or make a concerted effort to find the most competent and best therapist in your community.Begin your search by making a list of five to 10 highly-rated therapists. Call each one and inquire about how they conduct therapy, which problems they have had the most success in solving, how much they charge per hour, and so forth. When you find several with whom you connect with over the phone, go meet them in person. Choose the one with whom you have the strongest connection.In the meantime, consider group therapy. It could help to stabilize your mood between your one-on-one sessions.Your letter touched upon some potential thinking errors. For instance, you have achieved success in your career but you downplay your achievements. When someone is depressed, they tend to minimize their successes. You might be guilty of minimization.Incorrect thinking can lead to incorrect decisions. It’s no small thing. Your thoughts and behavior are correlative. It’s important that your thoughts are consistent with reality so as to avoid making mistakes in life.One of your biggest complaints is your being tired. I’m not certain if you meant tired of life in a more general sense or if you are quite literally fatigued. In the latter case, medications often cause fatigue. Tiredness increases irritability which affects mood. Medication changes an individual’s personality, even if ever so slightly. Many people have reported that they do not feel quite like themselves when taking medication.Reading is not an official treatment for depression but there are some great books that just might improve your mindset and help move you in the right direction. Some of my favorites include: The Road Less Traveled by M. Scott Peck; Many Lives, Many Masters by Dr. Brian Weiss; and Man’s Search for Meaning by Dr. Viktor Frankl.I have also recently came across a great blog called Barking Up The Wrong Tree by Eric Barker. Some of his work has been featured in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Time Magazine, among others. It’s filled with evidence-based insights about happiness. You might want to check it out.I hope that my advice has helped you in some small way. If your current therapy regimen isn’t working, then search for something better and don’t stop until you are satisfied. Yes, it might take some work but it is well worth your time and effort. The right treatment can make all the difference. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: Met my sister-in-law in 2004 she is heavy set and had an ordinary style. I have pin up style and platinum blonde hair, several tattoos. Soon after she went from dark brown hair to blonde. Started wearing flower clips in her hair, buying same brand pin up purses as me. Then she bought the same car as mine (black) hers white and had my bro buy same truck as my husband (black) his white. [/INST] There is a saying that imitation is the best compliment. But your sister-in-law’s behavior suggests something serious. Taping your conversations goes well beyond flattery. I think you are correct to worry about how far this will go.Although a certain amount of copying others is normal — that’s after all where fashion trends come from — this level of excess is not normal. It speaks to a kind of desperation. Not knowing who she is or maybe not liking who she is, she cloaks herself in your identity. I can only begin to imagine how empty she must feel to go to the lengths she does to become your “twin”. It must be frustrating indeed for you to feel like she is intruding on your self-expression.I’m sorry her husband won’t deal with it, although I can understand that he may just want to minimize drama in his relationship with her. It may be that he is already making many concessions to live with her. I do think that loving her means getting her some help for how bad she feels. A therapist would help her develop a stronger sense of self so she would feel more comfortable in her own skin.As for you: Forget about “confronting” her. It just feeds into the problem. Ideally, distance yourself as much from her as possible. Don’t make any big announcement about it. That will only trigger her. Just quietly try not to see her so often. Switch things up whenever you feel like it. Try out different churches. Experiment with different styles. Don’t tell her in advance. Just do what you want to do. Above all: Compliment her on anything she does that is unique to her, and encourage your brother and other members of the family to do the same.You might want to see a therapist yourself — not because you own the problem but because a therapist might have suggestions that are more specific to your situation than I can offer.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I need to break out of cyclic depressive problem but humiliated to seek help. I believe that I am suffering from severe depression (and the site’s test also implies this), but cannot bring myself to seek help. Any time I have sought help recently or at a similar episode in the past, I have been unable to achieve anything from those I have approached, and have ended up feeling worse in the long-term. In a breakdown recently I tried to explain my symptoms to my mother, but was so worried about upsetting her that I only managed half-truths. She reassured me that I am just very tired, not feeling well (have been suffering from fluey symptoms recently) and just feeling a bit emotional. This helped a little bit, but things were back the way they had been in the morning. [/INST]  You are not weak, melodramatic or attention-seeking. You seem to be a person who is legitimately suffering from depression. People who are depressed are not weak nor are they acting so they can gain attention. If you had a friend who was suffering from depression would you tell her “oh shut up you’re just weak…stop pretending…snap out of it?” I highly doubt you would. You’d probably try to help and encourage her to seek help. You would not put her down or call her names like you are doing to yourself. You’d likely be kind and supportive to a friend in need of help. You need to treat yourself in the same supportive manner that you would a good friend.You say that you are too ashamed or humiliated to seek help again. You feel that if you sought help again and it didn’t work out it might be enough to put you “over the edge.” I understand your fear but I don’t think your past experiences should stop you from trying again. Let me explain why.Let’s analyze your past attempts to access help. The first person you went to for help was your mother. The advice she gave you was ultimately not very useful according to your letter. The problem in this situation may have been that you didn’t tell her the whole truth about how you were feeling. She didn’t have a fair chance to help you because you withheld the truth from her. There is a chance that had you told her the truth she could have helped you. It’s also possible that had she known how you were really feeling she still wouldn’t have been able to help. The point here is that she did not have the opportunity to help you fully because you withheld facts from her.You then went to your general practitioner (GP). He was kind and sensitive but could not offer you much help. He then referred you to a psychiatrist (I am assuming it was a psychiatrist since usually that is what people mean when they say “psych doctor”).Your last attempt to seek help was with a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist gave you the impression that she didn’t care. She also had an intern in the office. Out of fear and humiliation you never returned for a second appointment. It was these experiences that led you to decide to stop trying to get help.With regard to your mother we already discussed the idea that you didn’t give her a fair chance to help you since you withheld the truth from her. Your GP seemed to care about your well-being but didn’t have the proper training to offer you counseling so he referred you to someone who might. You then went to one psychiatry appointment that did not go well and you never returned for another.I can understand your hesitation to seek help based on your past experiences but in reality you’ve barely accessed the mental health system. The truth is that your interaction with the mental health system amounts to one information-gathering evaluation with a psychiatrist. You’ve never actually met with a counselor. You have yet to meet with someone who actually could help you. I usually advise people to see or talk to at least 10 counselors when they initially begin to look for help. There are good counselors available but often it takes time, patience and effort to find one you like. It’s not that you need to give this process another chance; it’s that you need to give it an initial chance.Searching for a counselor is where you need to start looking for help. Generally psychiatrists do not offer counseling. Most psychiatrists only see individuals strictly for medication. You might benefit from medication but many people start with counseling first and then add on medicine later if it’s needed.Your ex-boyfriend is correct to suggest that you try again to access help. Maybe he too realizes that you’ve barely given it a chance. You are suffering and without help this problem may only intensify. I commend you on your past willingness to seek help but now is not the time to give up. Giving up now would be illogical because as we’ve discovered you’ve barely begun the process of accessing help.Lastly, you said that you’re ashamed and humiliated to seek help. You shouldn’t be. There is nothing to be ashamed of. People who seek help when they have a problem are brave, admirable and wise, not stupid, dumb or weak. If you are hurting and suffering as much as it seems that you are then why not seek help from trained professionals? Why would you choose to continue to suffer? If you had a broken leg wouldn’t you see a doctor? If you needed help with your taxes wouldn’t you see an accountant? If you wanted to lose weight and get into shape for a marathon wouldn’t you consider a personal trainer? You’d probably have no problem seeing a doctor for a broken leg, an accountant for a tax issue or a personal trainer to train for a marathon. If you’d have no problem accessing help from those specialized professionals then why would you be ashamed to seek counseling for depression? There is truly no difference. They’re all smart choices.Meeting with a competent, qualified therapist could change your life for the better but you’ll never find one if you don’t try. Don’t give up on attempting to access help when you’ve barely started. Thanks for writing. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hey, I’ve been really struggling because I’ve been thinking about this problem a lot. So a quick background story. I am the oldest in 5 kids and my parents were married for over 15 years. I also come from a middle eastern background and a very strict religious family. So I’m not sure if anyone is going to understand how hard it is to say anything to anyone. So my dad was sick since 2011 he had a stroke that made him paralyzed on his whole left side. I was around 9 years old when he started being sick. My mom would always take care of him and stay by his side or at least that’s what I thought. But when I was 11, I started seeing my mom talk to different guy on the phone and always flirting with him. I was young and I told her mom are you talking to anyone else. But she denied it and then changed the password for her phone so I wouldn’t look at anything. I ignored it for about a year or so, now around this time, my dad was getting better and the relationship between them was great, there weren’t any problems and we almost never saw them fighting, but I still heard her talking to that guy and saw her many times meet with him when my dad wasn’t home and she always thought I didn’t know and I forgot about it. Time passed and I always ignored, I never told anything to any of my other siblings or faced her with it again. Time passed and my dad got sick again, and she was still talking to that guy in addition to 2 other guys that I knew about and they looked a lot younger than her. I would always find a way to know her password and open her chats to see all the flirty messages between her and the other guys. I always cried by myself and kept it in me since then. Speed up to two years ago, I was 14 at that time, my dad got another stroke and was really sick, he passed away. My mom continued to talk to one of the guys and I don’t know what happened to the other two. I regret not telling my dad anything. And if anyone of my uncles knows about her texts and the pictures she sends to that guy, they will kill her because it is against our religion and our culture and they are very strict. I always cry and I still look thru her phone and see all the disgusting things she says and sends to that guy. I don’t know if I should tell anyone or keep it a secret still. Oh, I forgot to mention that the guy she’s still talking is also married and has kids.(From the USA) [/INST] I am very sorry you had such a loss with your father. It also sounds like, in many ways, you’ve lost your mother too. There are several things happening here that involve cultural, familial, and developmental issues and we will walk through each of them.However, the first thing I would encourage you to do is STOP LOOKING AT YOUR MOM’S PHONE. Whatever you believe you are doing by looking at it one thing is certain: You are not going to feel better and it is an invasion of your mom’s privacy. If the roles were reversed, you wouldn’t want her to do this to you. You already have too much information and don’t know what to do with what you already have. Looking for more will only add to your burden, and very likely push you and your mother further apart.Secondly, for many reasons, there isn’t a lot for you to do with the information you have. Culturally you are in a difficult position because to reveal what you know would require you to admit to explain that you’ve invaded your mother and father’s privacy, and this in and of itself may not only diminish how you are perceived by whom you tell but may discount your word altogether.With that being said, I do think you should find a way to talk about what you’ve learned but in a safe way. Sending us an email was a very good start. The work for you now is to find a trusted person to talk to about your own feelings about your mom, not so much about what she did or didn’t do—but your feelings about it. This will give you a safe place to release your feelings, and help get yourself feeling better.I think a good way of doing this is to talk to someone in your school. Perhaps there is a teacher of counselor you can talk to about this that will be able to hear how stressful this information has been for you to carry.Finally, you may also want to ask to see a therapist. Very legitimately you can say that you are having very difficult feelings related to your father’s death. To find someone in your area you can go to the “find help” tab at the top of the page, or you can ask a trusted teacher or counselor at the school to help you see a professional.The key is to find a safe place where you can talk about what all of this feels like.

Over the summer, his ex tried to get back with him, and although he rejected her, it’s lead to a great deal of insecurity for me. About a month ago, almost two months ago, things started to get terrible. The first thing I remembered was that he saw a picture which aroused him, and that upset me. I knew it was normal, but I felt horrible for about a week. and then after that, I started doubting he loved me, something I had believed for months (this wasn’t because the picture incident). The next week, my fears moved onto something else, and everything’s been rotating. A lot’s happened in these couple months. I confessed to cheating 5 months before that, he forgave me, we moved on. I continued worrying maybe there was something I hadn’t told him, although he told me I didn’t need to say anymore, that it’s okay and he wants to be with me. to sum things up, there’s always something for me to worry about, there’s no break. I recently realized I used to flirt with men, that I didn’t even like, just because when they liked me it made me feel better about myself. So I started being careful about everything I said to guys, making sure I wasn’t trying to attract them. But I still worried, and So I’ve stopped talking to men online. But now I’m worried that maybe I’ve been trying to attract females as well, when I’m straight. I feel terrible about everything I’ve done, and even though my boyfriend isn’t concerned about my cheating again, I just can’t trust myself. I could say hi to a person, and hours later wonder if I was intending to attract them. I can’t tell the difference between when I’m trying to be friendly or when I’m flirting, and it’s driving me insane. And the worst thing is that even if I move past this, I’ll be worried about something else the second after. My boyfriend’s become fed up of me talking to him about all of this, since he has his own depression to deal with, and I understand that. I just don’t know what to do anymore; I can’t stop over analyzing each of my actions, and I can’t stop worrying and picking out details of my past mistakes. [/INST]  Since you are still in high school I would encourage you to take the time to talk to the school’s guidance counselor. At the core of your issue is that you cannot trust yourself. This is important work for you to focus on. While the relationship concern is front and center now, trusting yourself will be important for your well-being for the rest of your life, Make learning how to improve this feature in your life the number one priority and you will see how the conditions improve. Often we can’t begin to trust ourselves until we talk with someone who can help us see our lives differently. You school counselor is the person to begin with.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, I need help. I have strong urges to torture people/animals and force them into a bloody death. Blood satisfies me, I find pleasure from leaving self-inflicted cuts on my skin. At first I thought I was just depressed but I don’t hurt myself for that reason, I hurt myself to see my blood. I like the way it looks and feels. But that’s not the only violent act I wish upon myself, I fantasize about being tortured, I want to die as a murder victim, I want my murderer to cut open my body, I want to see my insides. These strange fantasies scare me, I can’t stop myself from thinking this way. In my spare time I catch myself glaring at people, planning their gruesome murder and seeing how I’d get away with it. I physically want to kill someone but I mentally don’t. I’m not sure if this is making sense to you, because it doesn’t even make sense to me. The only thing stopping me from hurting others is getting my satisfaction from illegal videos online, on gruesome websites such as ‘bestgore.com’ and ‘liveleak’. On these websites, people upload either real-life murder videos that they have committed, or videos of gruesome things that they have seen. I am not disgusted by dead bodies, gore or blood. Instead, I wish to be in a situation involved with a lot of blood. I have two very close, childhood friends that know about this, but no one else knows. I’m afraid that one day I’ll be sent to a mental institution if I end up doing something horrible. Let’s backtrack a little. I grew up in an abusive family, i don’t want to get into that situation but it might have something to do with the way I’m feeling right now. Ever since I was a child I had always loved death and gore, I remember when I was young, I watched the movie ‘Titanic’. I was never interested in the romance, instead, I would skip ahead to the scene where the ship sank and the passengers froze to death. Whenever my parents weren’t home, or I was alone, I’d play that scene. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I really need your help. [/INST]  You mentioned being attracted to the physical act of killing and seeing blood. Similarly, people who engage in self-injury are also attracted to the physical release they get from it. It temporarily allows them to shift away from their emotional pain but it is very short-lived. It seems that you are suffering and searching for alternative outlets for your pain. Had you not experienced an abusive childhood, it’s unlikely that you would be having these problems.The people who were supposed to care for you, to love and to protect you, were the ones who hurt you. That is a breach of the ultimate trust. Anyone in that situation would have felt powerless and helpless. Murder fantasies could be your way of compensating for those feelings. In murder fantasies, you have the ultimate power and control. Nobody can hurt you because you have all of the control. To murder someone is to take away their life force, to end their power and domination over you.Murder is an act of evil. You’re right to be concerned about this problem because should you carry out your fantasies, you would likely go to prison and perhaps be executed for your crime.It’s very encouraging that you recognize that something is wrong and that you want help. It significantly increases the probability of your overcoming this problem. You are an excellent candidate for counseling. Counseling will teach you how to express your strong feelings in healthy ways. Others have done it and you can do it too. If you believe that you might harm yourself or someone else, seek emergency assistance. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  My mother has always mystified me. She is very uncomfortable showing her emotions, to the point where she has never said “I love you” to me, and my father sometimes forces her to say it to him. As I got older, I learned that she was different from other mothers by watching the way that mothers and daughters joked around or hugged one another. She would be uncomfortable showing affection in this way, and I have so rarely been offered any emotional support from her or been given any pearls of wisdom. [/INST]  I don’t have enough information to comment on your mother’s issues. But I can speak to your last paragraph. People aren’t doomed to repeat what they experienced while growing up. Yes, your childhood has a lot of influence, especially if you don’t think about it. But part of growing up is deciding what you want to keep and what you want to change.Remember that you had other women in your life to observe. Perhaps you had a grandmother or aunts, a best friend’s mom or teachers you admired. All of those relationships contribute to how you think of yourself as a woman and how you relate to other people. You can draw on parts of all of them.Some people manage to sort out how they want to be totally on their own. Other people find it helpful to talk to a therapist for awhile. A therapist can help you think deeply about what you honor and respect about your mother and therefore want to carry forward and what you would like to do differently. You’ll have support while you discover perhaps untapped resources within yourself and try new things.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been having this “problem” for a while. Initially I didn´t think it was bad, I just thought it was part of my personality. However, I have seen, for a few years, that it is an obstacle. I don´t seem to understand feelings. I know, in theory, what they are, but when i have to interpret them or understand why they are happening, I get confused and frustrated. I have emotions and feelings, that much I know. I usually see the world in a more logical manner, as much as possible, but i can’t run from feelings and when an emotional situation occurs (with me or others) i try to put it together but it’s too complex for me, which I think it’s odd because other people around me comprehend them so easily. For example, I know how anger, happiness, etc, looks like, but in a real-life situation, I can’t understand them or why people express them with such ease. Maybe it’s a skill that I should have learned when I was a kid? Should I tell someone? (from Portugal) [/INST] I do believe it is the skills we learned over time. Understanding feelings and their use in various social situations is a teachable skill and one that can happen in group therapy. I encourage you to find a group with a competent group therapist. Most forms of group therapy will teach members to give feedback to one another about their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. What may be most effective is finding a group for people your own age. This tends to help as many other teenagers may be struggling with similar issues, and working together to help one another can be a very empowering process. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My brother is not taking care of his physical health. He has lost all his teeth and will not discuss any of is health issues with his siblings. His wife divorced him about 5 years ago. His only child 16 years old, no longer spends time or lives with him. My brother lives alone,works from home, and has very little interaction with other people. At Christmas he did not talk much, couldn’t eat dinner, had an accident and soiled a chair, then left abruptly and was upset because we all were asking if he was o.k. [/INST]  It is difficult to help someone who is reluctant to accept your help. Only in rare circumstances can an individual be forced into treatment. Generally, those circumstances include:You did not mention whether your brother is experiencing the type of psychological problems that would warrant forced treatment. If so, you may want to check with an attorney or become familiar with your state’s law regarding involuntary commitment procedures. I’m not suggesting that you should attempt to involuntarily commit your brother but if his deterioration is due primarily to a mental health condition, then it may be the appropriate action.One potential option is to have a family intervention. Include family or friends who are equally concerned or who share your opinion. If you approach your family member alone, he or she may simply see it as their opinion against yours. Having other people who share your opinion further strengthens your case.If you choose a family intervention, have a discussion about what each person is planning to say prior to the meeting. It ensures that you are all “on the same page.” Consider excluding any individuals who you think might make the situation worse.One word of caution regarding family interventions. They do not always go smoothly. The possibility exists that your brother will completely reject your efforts. He may become defensive and angry. Such a reaction could shut down all further communication. Ideally, if you are considering an intervention, it would be best to consult a trained and experienced family therapist/interventionalist. The find help tab, at the top of this page, can help you locate a mental health clinician in your community.Finally, even if you try every idea that you can think of to assist your brother, realize that your power to effectively help him may be limited. In the absence of a serious mental health condition, leading to his refusal to accept your help, you can do very little. You cannot force someone to accept treatment that does not want it. That reality can be difficult to accept. It is exceedingly difficult to watch a loved one suffer or to make choices that are not in their best interest. No one wants their loved ones to suffer. I hope I’ve helped. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My boyfriend of three years and I have had a rocky relationship. We enjoyed the usual bliss when we first got together, however after talk of serious commitment came up and we moved out together last year, I saw an ugly side of him rear up! He mentally and physically abused me, and I felt trap with him because of our lease and my continued feelings of conflicted affection and love for him. Finally, after he told me that he wanted to break up last October, despite still living together, I began to mentally distance myself from him to avoid being hurt furthermore. [/INST]  I hesitate to offer direct advice in this column because there is often so much I don’t know (and can’t know) when my only source of information is a letter. But in this case, I’ll venture the opinion that you should get out. What you are talking about is domestic violence. Your instincts to not reconnect are correct. Yes, I know there are sweet sides to him. I kow there are times when he is a loving and supportive partner. But you can’t relax into this relationship. You are always walking on eggshells, braced for the next temper tantrum. No, you are not a bad person for not having faith in him. You are sensible.You may find it harder than you think it will be to separate from this relationship. Here’s the website for a domestic violence program in your city. The hotline is 800-640-0333.

"<s>[INST] I have been was in a relationship with a man for three years. I will call him A. We lived together and he wanted to and still wants to marry me. While I started and developed the relationship with him because I was very lonely at the time, I developed feelings for him and to this date, he is my closest friend. The problem that I always had when I was with him was that I was never in love with him. Staying in the relationship felt very emotionally safe and I was happy being with him even though I never felt the “butterflies in the stomach” being with or thinking of him. He felt like a family and I did and still do care about him. And that was what I was looking for – the emotional comfort of having someone next to me who loves me and cares about me. The missing part in our relationship was the fact that I never felt romantically about him and so two years later, I started sleeping with another man B, which developed into a relationship. I feel in love with B but I have been comparing him with A and this of course has made me see more of his negatives. I am very attracted to him and like to spend time with him. However, when the time came to “go home”, i.e. do every day things, relax and stay home, I would always want to meet with A. A continues to feel like home, like the place where I go at the end of the day to be comfortable, share my day at work, watch TV, or just relax while being silent. [/INST]  As difficult as this is, you are a lucky woman, indeed, to have two men in your life who love you and want to be with you and with whom you can imagine a future. Although on the face of it, A is the representative of more mature and lasting love, B has the advantage of being the one who makes your heart swoon. Neither would be a bad choice – as long as you committed to the choice you made.However — I don’t think your problem is who to choose. It sounds like your could be happy with either. The problem as I see it is that you are very scared to make any choice at all. By staying ambivalent and by thinking about the charms of these two men as different but equal, you forestall making any decision. If you delay long enough, one of these guys is going to give up. Then you will have to choose between the one who stayed or no choice at all. Meanwhile, you are being dishonest with both. When either of them finds out about the other, that may decide the issue for you as well.The common denominator of these possibilities is the result: You avoid making an active choice and taking responsibility for it. Please don’t hear this as a scold. It’s not. It’s intended to provoke you to do some thinking about just what you are doing. I wonder why you are so reluctant to choose. I wonder why taking responsibility for the course of your life makes you stop in your tracks. What has happened in your life that you have reached your 30s so scared of commitment that you let yourself deceive good men who love you?I hope you will consider seeing a therapist to help you sort this out. Your letter shows you to be an intelligent, thoughtful person who could make good use of some sessions with a sympathetic counselor who would push you to be honest with yourself. You are fortunate to live in a city where there are many therapists. One caution: You could repeat the same dilemma in looking for a therapist; never being able to choose between equally well trained and experienced people. I suggest you talk to your doctor or someone else you trust to get a recommendation and just go with it – at least at first.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I dated someone normal and emotionally stable for over 5 years. We never fought, I was extremely bored (person did not have much education, not many friends) and felt unsatisfied emotionally and sexually. Now for the last 8 months I have been in relationship with someone just the opposite: very passionate, handsome, smart, charismatic, but emotionally unstable. We fight way too much for different reasons. I feel like I love him, but I am so tired of fighting. Recently I started feeling like I cause the fights, and that I am crazy. One recent thing that is a big issue now is jealousy. My bf is a photographer/artist, and he admires female beauty so much. He also teaches college, and all of his students are 20-22 years old! Maybe it would not be a problem, but he thinks that young females (17-22) are the most sexually desirable and beautiful, as they are young and haven’t gained any weight. At the same time, he compliments me all the time, telling me how beautiful and perfect I am, that I am the best woman he has ever met, how much he wants to marry me and so on. But I, maybe due to being insecure, can’t help but feel old at 29. I feel so depressed that I get angry even seeing tall model-looking teenage girls now. I never felt this way before. No wonder I lost 23 pounds without ANY dieting/exercising in less than a year with no intention, or at least no conscious intention of doing so. I am 5’7′ and now size 2 (used to be 4-6). I am a good-looking girl, very successful career-wise, but I still feel inadequate. I spend too much time thinking that 10 years from now, if we were to have family, I will be making good money with my stable job (he never has money), while he is flirting with his 20 year old students. Maybe taking pictures of females. Not because he wants them, as he said, but just because women are beautiful and the images are great. Maybe my problem is that I, being insecure, got into the relationship with a visual artist guy. Even though he says that I mean everything to him, I feel in so much pain on a regular basis. I get sad, angry, and don’t know what to do at all. Thank you for any advice. (age 29, from US) [/INST]  Thank you for writing in with your question. From what you are saying here, it doesn’t sound like your boyfriend is necessarily doing anything wrong, except objectifying women’s bodies — (is it art or objectification?). You also describe him as emotionally unstable but I’m not sure what you mean by that exactly. So, the problem may be mostly yours and stemming from your self-described insecurity and jealousy.I’m concerned that you lost so much weight while dating him and I’m concerned that you have found a partner who appears to be so focused on outward beauty. What you are describing is not a good combination.I think it would be a good idea to see a therapist who specializes in body image/eating disorders just to make sure you make your decisions about this relationship from a healthy place. Once you do this, you may also benefit from some couple’s counseling to work on the fighting and emotional ups and down you both experience. Before you can work on the relationship’s future potential, you need to get a better handle on what is going on right now. Perhaps the ideal person for you is somewhere in between “boring” and “emotionally unstable,” but what is most important is loving yourself and knowing that you are worth it.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] I started smoking weed this summer for about 3 months. Maybe twice a day. Sometimes more. I never had any side effects, and it wasn’t to escape anything, I was back in LA and it was just a way to enjoy the beautiful weather even more. The night before I was supposed to leave I tried a bong for the first time and I tripped really badly. The day after I felt a little off but I was fine by the afternoon. I came back to London and like an idiot I tried a bong again (this is maybe a month later) to see if I could handle it now. I had another similar experience but because it wasn’t my first time tripping, I felt I was more in control but the day after i suffered depersonalization (or I just felt high) but it disappeared within one day. I went home for New Years and saw my old friends, everybody was doing something, they were either in school or at work and I started feeling a little useless subconsciously even though I’ve done more in my life than they have. On New Years I took one hit of a joint and went about my night- everything was fine. Two days later I woke up from a dream feeling dizzy and felt like throwing up. I fell asleep and woke up fine. For a week after, everyday I felt worst and I started having panic attacks (for the first time in my life) and started having anxiety everyday after. I was worried it might have been due to the weed. Anyways its almost been a month since now and im generally okay (my sanity score is 35) but i still dont feel like myself. Or maybe the anxiety and panic attacks were such a huge blow to my “system” that I am normal but I keep over thinking everything and doubting my “realness”. I feel like I have to fight my brain to stop overthinking. The weather is also really depressing here and being 23 im going through a bit of quarter life crisis (which is normal at this age), but the mixture of all this causes me to wake up sad, and today I just started crying just praying to go back to my normal self again. Any idea what’s going on? I feel im going crazy! I also tend to feel more relaxed at night at home. [/INST]  Many people have experienced and described exactly what you are experiencing. Someone smokes weed and then experiences symptoms of depersonalization. The symptoms are disruptive and frightening. In fact, it has become a common concern among those who write into “Ask The Therapist.”The fact that this frightening experience continues to happen exemplifies the dangers of smoking marijuana. If marijuana were highly regulated and its ingredients were heavily controlled, then perhaps it might be safe. That is currently not the case. The majority of people who use marijuana get it from a drug dealer “on the street.” Any drug purchased in an uncontrolled setting has the potential to be dangerous and can cause permanent psychological or physical damage.Over time, your symptoms of depersonalization will likely decrease but we can’t be certain. You may want to consider seeing a psychiatrist who might prescribe a medication to assist with your symptoms. You may only need a low dose of medication to decrease your symptoms. Even if you decide against taking medication, it may be advantageous to consult a psychiatrist about your symptoms. Psychiatrists specialize in neurobiology and biochemistry and may provide helpful insight about your feelings of depersonalization. Also consider consulting a psychotherapist. A therapist could teach you coping skills and relaxation techniques to help with your panic and anxiety attacks.Be careful. I would strongly advise against using illicit substances. Drug use is dangerous and has the potential to cause permanent damage. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m 63-year-old male. I was abused physically and emotionally from a very young age by my father. He often whipped me with a thin pigskin belt as hard as he could while he screamed at me. When I cried he would whip me until I stopped crying. I remember the feeling of imploding when I had to do this. My mother tried to make him stop but he would lock us in the bathroom while the beating took place. I can still hear my mother screaming from the other side of the door for him to stop. When he didn’t whip me he called me names and told me I would never amount to anything. If I cried when he taunted me he would say they were “crocodile tears and didn’t mean anything.” My father died when I was 11 and as much as anything I felt relief. [/INST] I’m not sure what kind of help you’re looking for. There must be something really, really sweet about your partner to keep you hanging in. You can’t complain about her not getting a job when you’ve so consistently picked up the slack and let her maintain her fiction that she is working on commission. Rather than try to make her be different, you need to look at what you can do differently.According to A Conscious Rethink’s website, there can be valid reasons you might feel like you want to get out of your relationship, and they reflect in your girlfriend’s lack of desire for employment: What concerns me most is that you’ve given up having your own son living with you and have accepted the sick sister into the household with no change in the financial arrangements. From your son’s point of view, he’s been replaced by the sister of someone he doesn’t even like. This is likely to have far-reaching consequences to your relationship with him. Is the relationship with the girlfriend really worth that?Given what little I know, I’d suggest you take a huge step back. You should try moving out. And then establish separate households. Date your girlfriend if you like but don’t support her. Reestablish your relationship on the basis of more equality. She will probably accuse you of being horrible and try to make you feel guilty. If you need to feel guilty (which I don’t think you do but apparently it is a tactic that works with you), feel terrible for underestimating her ability to be a fully functioning adult and for putting her before your own kids. Then please try to be kinder to yourself and do what you need to do to make some important changes.I wish you well.  </s>"

I’m concerned you may have confused several important but different issues.First: Your temper: You said that you grew up with a bad-tempered father. Since he was not able to control his own temper, it is likely that he could not teach you constructive ways to deal with anger and disappointment. You have copied his methods. Those methods don’t solve problems. In fact, they make problems with other people.Second: You were being bullied by the people who circled you. Anyone would be frightened in that situation. You should not have to deal with being picked on and picked last. Rampaging got the group to back off but did not solve the problem. You need to talk with your aunt and grandfather about the problems in school. I hope they will talk with the school administration about protecting you from the bullies.Third: I don’t think you are weird. I do think you have an artist’s eye. That is not something to be ashamed of. Your obsession with drawings and how things look is common among artists and photographers.

"<s>[INST] Hello! I’m 24 and I’ve been with my husband (partner, really; no wedding yet, although it’s in the works) for over 4 years. Up until earlier this year, I had a pretty okay relationship with his mother. [/INST]  This isn’t something to just get over. In fact this is something to be very proactive about – with both your mother-in-law (to be) and with your partner. That relationship will be where the intimacy and connectivity can grow. Stay connected with him about your feelings, be sure to acknowledge his support, and be much more discerning about what and how much you share with your mother-in-law.From your description your mother-in-law doesn’t sound like she knows or cares that she has this impact on you. You will need several tools to unhook from her. The main feature is to not let her activate your defensiveness. In other words, the work here is to ‘detach with love’ as the Al-Anon programs might say, and don’t take any of her bait.There are three strategies that tend to work in these situations, and they come in varying degrees of leverage. All three have one thing in common, and that is to leave the discomfort with her rather than with you. This is not antagonistic, but rather leaving the problem at its origin, with her. You and your partner have already begun doing this by not responding to her manipulations.In his classic book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig referred to the fact that the Japanese have a notice at the beginning of their instructions on how to assemble the newly purchased object. The notice says (I am paraphrasing): “To begin, the assembler must be in the right frame of mind.” This is where you begin with your encounter with her. Begin in the right frame of mind, which is: This is her issue — don’t let it become yours.When she says an unkind comment or criticism offer back a simple descriptive statement of what she said: “It sounds like you’re unhappy with the fact I want to go to law school.” Or, “You seem disappointed in our decisions.” In other words, let her criticisms and persecutions be hers, don’t take the bait and feel the need to defend yourself. A descriptive statement allows you to stay present but not overwhelmed by her manipulation.The second coping method is to respond with a statement that directly identifies the fact that the issue is hers. “It must be hard for you to feel so disappointed so often,” or “It seems like you are unhappy with me.”The third encounter has a uniqueness to it because it is two-fold. It uses a question as a way of undoing the hurtfulness behind her condescending or persecuting manner. It works something like this: After she has said something hurtful, you ask a question: “When you say things like that, do you ever wonder what it might be like for me to hear?”The second part of this depends on you, and what you feel is appropriate. The stance is the same. DO NOT TAKE THE BAIT. After she answers the question you may use the other strategies to stay engaged with her while not being defensive. Typically someone like your mother-in-law is skilled in not taking responsibility for his or her passive-aggressive hurtfulness, so a direct confrontation is usually unproductive. But offering some feedback, with very little or no expectations, in this second part might be helpful. After her response to the first part, something like: “…because when you say things like that it makes it hard for me to be around you.” Don’t feel the need to explain or defend yourself. Doing so will get you nowhere but more frustrated. Just say what you feel is factual, then back to the other strategies without trying to defend or criticize. Your job here is to protect yourself from feeling overwhelmed.

"<s>[INST] From a teen in Egypt: Hello, i hope you would help me to pass this problem. my father is working in another country from when i was 8 years old. my mom would keep me in a room and lock it and i hear a weird voice, she would keep me naked in a bathroom without any clothes or towels because she know i will never open the door because i’m shy, she would give me medicines and sleeping pills. one day i wasn’t sure what my mom was doing until the door was slightly opened and i knew who the man was !. this made me know what everything and what she was doing, until now mom found a new guy and she do horrible things on the telephone and i’m i afraid that my younger brother who is 7 now would hear her. [/INST]  No kid should have to live this way. It’s inappropriate and probably illegal. Unfortunately, I don’t know what resources are available to you in Egypt. In the United States, child protective services could get involved as a way to help your brother.I’m glad you tried to talk to your mother. That’s the first step, but I’m not surprised that it didn’t help. She has quite literally kept you in the dark for years.You didn’t mention whether you have talked to your father about the situation. Does he know how his children are being treated? Is it possible that he could take your brother to be with him? I suspect your mother will be angry if you talk to your dad. But if talking to him is the only possible way to protect your brother, it might be worth putting up with her shouting.I’m afraid that I just don’t have enough information about what is possible where you live. Perhaps a relative or your school counselor does know. Don’t feel you need to keep your mother’s secrets. There are some secrets that shouldn’t be kept and mistreating children is one of them.If there is no immediate way to get help — you can take the long view. Go to school. Stay in regular contact with your brother through social media so he knows he has a sister who loves him and cares. Get good grades so you can get a good job. Then consider taking your little brother to live with you.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] The man in my life is 58 and I am 57. We have lived together for three years. I need help on how to open a discussion with him regarding a behavior of his that is inappropriate. Occasionally he puts his hands on females in the family or close friends. Explanation: My sister was standing in the kitchen while I was cooking. She was in the pathway as “John” walked through the kitchen to the sun room. He touches her arm. Then he walks behind her to leave the kitchen and touches her arm again. Then he immediately comes back stands behind her and takes hold of each of her arms and just stands there. He just stood there. Said nothing. It was so odd, I just stood there thinking ‘he looked stupid. I didn’t say anything. I was a bit stunned and embarrassed. My sister just grinned and looked at me confused. Another time, while drinking, he put his arm around my niece with his hand up into her armpit. In the situation with my sister it appeared that he couldn’t stand – he just had to touch her! He has behaved like this on several other occasions. How can I approach him and get the message across that “this is inappropriate and the recipient is uncomfortable with this type of attention ? [/INST]  The simple answer to your question is this: When you are both in a good mood, raise the issue as calmly and kindly as you can. Tell him that you know he doesn’t mean anything by it but that it makes you and others uncomfortable. Not everyone likes to be touched in a familiar way. Ask him if he can please not touch people unless they ask for it or reciprocate.However, what concerns me more than the incidents you describe is that you feel inhibited about talking with your boyfriend of three years about something that concerns you. You are both mature people in your 50s and you have been living together for some time. Why is it a problem to have a conversation with him about this? I may be reading more into this than is appropriate, I know. But if there are many issues that you can’t talk about, you and “John” have some work to do on your relationship. Giving and receiving feedback in a loving way is an important part of an intimate relationship. It’s what helps us grow as individuals and as partners. If that is lacking in your partnership, I hope you will consider some couples counseling to help you develop it.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My ex re-appeared before my wedding. That was three years ago. I have been talking to him secretly, even though I love my husband dearly. However, for different reasons. My husband is loving, loyal and a great provider -however our chemistry/sexual passion is not where it should be. On the other hand my ex and I were over the top in that department. He only says he wants sex from me and nothing serious.I have seen him twice to talk, but not so much as touched him- as I do not want to dishonour my husband or myself.)Is this just a case of reclaiming what was his? I think I am in love with him and I think I would leave my husband to be with him if he seriously wanted another relationship. The thing is, I am unsure if he can be trusted, or ever will…what should I do? [/INST]  You said that you do not want to dishonor your husband or yourself, but you are actually achieving both by secretly talking to and meeting with your ex. There are many marriages, a surprising number of marriages, that are open sexually. Both the husband and the wife engage in sexual practices with other people. These marriages seem to have no higher a failure rate than marriages where both parties are monogamous.When a spouse has a sexual affair, without the knowledge of their partner, the problem is not the actual sexual act but is instead the deception and lies that came with the affair. If you don’t believe me, ask anyone whose spouse has had an affair. What was the overwhelming problem? What thought filled their mind and did not allow them to sleep or function normally? Here’s what I’ve heard, in my counseling practice, over and over again. “How can I ever trust my spouse again?”When I attempt to save these marriages, the issues that I will deal with, the problems in a relationship, will all deal with trust. Quite naturally and normally the person that was cheated on, who I will now referr to as the “cheatee” will have major problems believing and trusting the cheater. That makes sense and it will take not months but years to once again trust the cheater. That’s assuming that the cheater has been completely trustworthy over that period of time.The second problem, which the layperson would not assume, will come from the cheater’s perspective. The cheater very quickly becomes tired and annoyed by being treated as if they are not trustworthy, which of course they are not and have proven that to be true with the deception and lies that they have committed during the course of their affair.Quite erroneously, the cheater believes that they can re-earn the trust of their spouse in a matter of days or perhaps a few weeks. Nothing could be further from the truth. It will take several years of fully trustworthy behavior for the cheater to be trusted once again.My advice to you? Immediately cease all contact with your ex-boyfriend. No phone calls, text messages, e-mails, Internet contact of any kind, is acceptable. If he works out at the same exercise facility as you do, quit and find a new place to exercise. If he works at the garage where you bring your car for repairs, find a new garage. If you share mutual friends, make it clear to your friends that they are not to discuss your ex-boyfriend with you in any manner. If they do not respect your wishes, end your relationship with them.Work on your marriage. If all is well with the marriage except for the sexual element, see a marriage counselor or sex therapist. Do this of course as a couple. If you are dissatisfied with your marriage and the therapy does not help, then you should end your marriage.It is normal to have feelings for people that you used to love. They may always have a soft spot in your heart but your loyalty and devotion belongs to your spouse. Do your best to maintain the sanctity of your marriage. You will never regret having done so.I hope things work out for you and I wish you the best of luck. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a 19 year old male in Belgium: So my first issue is I recently have been very self-conscious about the way I look. I daily look myself in the mirror many times a day. Sometimes I feel good looking and I am happy, But then just hours/minutes/days later I feel ugly and it goes on like this on and on again, I can get really depressed and cry sometimes because of this. [/INST]  I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of a letter, of course. However, from what you wrote, my first guess would be that your doctors are correct. The behaviors you are reporting are typical of social anxiety.I’m more interested in supporting you in getting real treatment than in confirming a diagnosis. Cognitive-behavior therapy has been found to be very useful for managing social anxiety. There are also medications that can help you feel a little better so that you can make good use of the talk therapy.My suggestion to you is that you stop looking at sites about mental illness and start going to a mental health counselor who can both answer your questions and can get your started on treatment to manage your distress.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.K.: I wish to know whether I should move into my Dad’s house, if that will make matter worse for me or can improve my life at the moment. [/INST]  This is a tough situation. Your home does sound like a pressure cooker. Your mom and stepdad are apparently restricted from doing very much outside of the home due to her disability. Isolation and lack of stimulation from friends and activity can wear people down, which often leads to irritability and can lead to depression. When you give them “attitude”, it may be the “last straw” for people who are already on the edge.In addition, their pride may be suffering if they are more dependent on your income than they want to accept. If that’s the case, their annoyance with you may be an attempt to regain some dignity by asserting their parental authority.At 17, you may want to reconnect with your father in order to make your own decisions about who he is and what your relationship should be. Your mother isn’t wrong to be concerned. But you are old enough and independent enough to take care of yourself now. It may be important to you to find out if he is willing to make amends for whatever happened when you were young.Before you make a decision, I hope you will have a serious, calm talk with your mom and step dad about the current situation. Admit your part in making home less than wonderful. Talk to them about what it is like for them to be so isolated and see if you can find ways for them to have more to do. Talk frankly about whether your financial contribution is necessary for their survival. A fresh start might be helpful to you, but not if it puts your folks into financial crisis and you end up feeling guilty for it. You may need to do some planning with them first.Meanwhile, do explore with your birth father about whether he would welcome having you with him. Explore employment possibilities before you quit your present job. It is generally easier to find a job while you have one. Prospective employers are more likely to hire someone who is demonstrably able to work than someone who is unemployed. (It’s not necessarily fair but it tends to be true.)Take your time. Talk it out. Work on your own attitude and do some clear planning. Impulsive moves in situations like this tend to end badly.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Ok so I’ve talked to my parents a few times about how I think I might have depression. I’ve taken the tests on here every other day and results are almost always the same, minor to severe depression. So when I talked to my parents they said it was just because my hormones are all over the place, but would my hormones give me suicidal thoughts or wanting to cut. I don’t cut or commit suicide because I’m scared of the pain. I have also lost interest in some of my favourite things. I don’t sleep normal anymore either, I just can’t sleep, and when I cant sleep I think about how my future looks like I’ll never make it or I’ll just let my family down. My family and parents are the main cause to these thoughts trying to live up to all their expectations. I am just wondering if I could get someones idea on my situation and if my suspicion is a possibility. [/INST]  I can’t provide a diagnosis over the Internet but anytime someone is considering self-harm or suicide, it’s serious. Depression might be the cause of your problems or it could be, as you indicated, your feeling pressure to live up to certain perceived expectations.Even though they did not respond as they should have, it was wise to speak to your parents. Consider showing them this letter as a demonstration of your seriousness. If they know that you are continuing to reach out for help, it might motivate them to act.If that does not work, then speak to the school guidance counselor or another school faculty member whom you trust. Inform them about how you feel and ask for their assistance. Someone at your school should be able to help.I can only provide a general response to your question but it’s important to recognize that the pressure you feel may be self-induced. In other words, these expectations may not be real or they may be exaggerated in your mind. Allow for the possibility that you are misreading the situation.That is why meeting with a mental health professional is so important, because he or she can provide an objective assessment of your situation.Do your best to seek mental health treatment. If you feel that you might harm yourself or someone else, call emergency officials so that they can protect you. I hope you’re able to find the help that you desire. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] This question has been bothering me for a year and a half since my father’s death. My father was a man committed to his family who has always been caring and loving toward us and everyone around him. All of a sudden -out of the blue – he started to feel uneasy and sick with no specific problems. He made an appointment with a doctor, who was unable to diagnose any physical problems and said that he was “imagining his illness” and diagnosed him as suffering from depression. [/INST] I am so sorry for your loss. You were fortunate to have such a loving and committed father. My research shows that heart disease and depression are often found together and each one can lead to the other. Given this statistic, co-existing illnesses may be more of a challenge to treat if there is depression involved – that is, if you’re not feeling well emotionally, it can be more of a challenge to follow treatment.In addition, people with depression appear to be at greater risk for contracting certain illnesses, such as heart disease, in the first place. All of these factors combined may increase risk for dying from illness than they may have been able to treat if they didn’t also have depression.As stated on the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics website:“According to the American Heart Association, one in 10 Americans, age 18 and older, have depression. Symptoms of depression are about three times more common in patients after an acute heart attack than in the general population, which strongly suggests a link between depression and heart disease.While being diagnosed with heart disease or having a heart attack may increase the risk of depression, depression itself may increase the chances of developing heart disease.According to University of Iowa cardiologist Milena A. Gebska, M.D., Ph.D., a number of factors may explain why patients with depression are at a higher risk for heart disease.There is a two-way relationship between heart disease and depression,” Gebska says. “On one hand, depression itself is an independent risk factor for adverse cardiac events in patients without known heart disease. On the other hand, patients with known heart disease, particularly those who develop a heart attack, are at increased risk of developing new diagnosis of depression.Gebska says it is somewhat difficult to prove that heart disease directly leads to a patient’s first-ever episode of depression since many patients may have not been formally diagnosed with depression prior to the cardiac event.However, from a medical perspective, we can say with certainty that both depression and heart disease often coexist,” Gebska says.In fact, emotional distress and depression were recently identified as new risk factors for coronary artery disease (blockages in the heart vessels).Common lifestyle habits brought upon by depression are similar to traditional cardiovascular risk factors. These include a sedentary lifestyle, obesity, smoking, poor diet and overeating, and excessive alcohol consumption. Skipping important medications also plays a role.”For more information, you can understand better how depression and heart disease corollate and co-exist. Do an internet search of “depression and heart disease”. You will find a number of studies that show a high correlation. I hope that your research on this topic helps to give you some comfort.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Australia: Over the past 15 years since leaving domestic violence I have struggled with Ataxia which is the result of assaults to my head. I have found it hard to fit in since. My age group (I’m 72) lives a normal life while Ataxia limitations put me in another basket. I could only keep up with the aged persons. [/INST]   It must have taken great courage to leave a DV situation when you did. Your letter reflects your inner strength and resolve. You know you are entitled to a good life and you aren’t accepting anything less. Good for you!If you haven’t already, I hope you will consult with an occupational therapist (OT) about ways to manage tasks you now find difficult. Occupational therapists help people participate in everyday activities (occupations) they want and need to do by adapting the environment, providing some adaptive equipment and teaching new skills to work around a disability. An OT may also be able to help you link up with peers who are more interested in someone’s abilities than the dis-ability.I hope you will also look for activities you enjoy. Focus on what you want most to do (sing? exercise? book club? bird watch? — whatever). Then make contact with the leader of the group to learn more about the membership. If it doesn’t feel like a fit, start a group of your own. FaceBook and even Craigslist as well as networking with friends and with your doctors can help you form a group of like-minded people of all abilities.Another option is to start volunteering for a cause or activity that you want to support. Choose something that will put you in regular contact with others who share your interest. Working side by side at a charity or a library will help friendships grow naturally. Often, once people get to know someone, they see the person, not the disability. (A bonus is that research shows that people who volunteer live longer!)By the way, I hope you won’t let people’s age get in the way of making friends. As you know from your own experience, people’s minds and hearts don’t always match what their bodies let them do. Activities that include people of all ages can enrich us in many ways. The young keep us young. The old offer their wisdom. Those of us in the middle get the benefit of both.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve been dating my boyfriend for 14 months now. During our relationship we’ve been back and forth a lot, mainly because it’s his first relationship (even though he’s in his late 20’s) and had a lot of insecurities. He broke it off once with me because we had been fighting a lot, mainly because I created arguments because I didn’t feel like he was in the relationship like he was supposed to be. He told me he wasn’t 100% sure that he was in love, and he said that he wasn’t whole heartedly in the relationship anymore. 3 weeks after we broke up he came back and said that he was sure about how he felt about me, and that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me because he was miserable when we were apart. Since then we’ve had a good relationship up until recently. He lost his job and is very stressed out and nervous because of it. He is always moody, snaps easily, and has no understanding for my wanting to talk things out and be understood when arguments come up. When I try to peace things out in a caring and loving manner he gets angry and says that he hates how we have to drag things out all the time. I try to explain to him that I want reassurance that he really wants to be here this time and the conversations become longer because I’m waiting to hear something reassuring from him while all he does it get angry and try to brush me off. He tells me he wants me to be his wife one day, that he wants to have a family with me and that he’s in love with me, yet I don’t feel it. I don’t know if it’s just from his moods or not, but I am scared that he is only saying this because he’s afraid to hurt me again. When he is in a good mood he is more loving and caring, but that almost never happens anymore. When he got angry yesterday he said that our arguments makes him doubt whether he wants to do this for the rest of his life, and it broke my heart. Should I leave him be when he gets in his moods or am I right in wanting to be reassured without having him get mad? [/INST]  Thank you for writing us. The thing that jumps out at me from your letter is that you’re not honoring your own feelings. You said very clearly that in the middle of all of his moods you really don’t feel loved by him. That’s important and I would honor that truth. If you’re not feeling it, and he’s not doing anything to change it, then you need to talk about your feelings in the relationship, not just his.It seems like the work in front of you is to decide if there’s enough in the relationship as it is for you to stay.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"

"<s>[INST] For the last couple of years, since my mom and step-dad married, he has been treating my siblings and me badly. I’m the oldest, being 16, and I have a younger sister who is 12,and a younger brother who is only a little over a year old. My step-dad gets up in my face quite often yelling and screaming. Other family members and my friends have witnessed it. No one in my family likes him except for my mother, (who seems to have a thing for abusive men. She divorced my father to reconcile with the man that punched her in the stomach and put a loaded revolver to her head while she was pregnant with me). My step-dad has come at me several times, asking if I wanted a piece of him and getting a little too close for comfort. I’m afraid that he’s going to actually hit me sometimes. [/INST]  Thanks for writing in with your question. You are in a very difficult situation and there’s probably not going to be a simple solution, but I believe there is always hope. It sounds like you have a lot going for you and things you care about such as school, sports, your horse and your boyfriend. Having positive things to put your time and focus on can make intolerable situations tolerable many times. However, I think it’s also important to know when you’ve had enough.If you feel like you can handle the current situation a couple more years by putting your energy into the things you mention, you may be able to handle the unhealthy home environment. I agree it would be immensely helpful if you could speak to a therapist to help you with this. Ohio has a law that supports teens getting a certain number of sessions without the parents being involved. You said your stepfather was upset by you asking for help but how did your mom feel?  If seeing an outside therapist just doesn’t happen, speak to your school counselor for additional support.On the other hand, if moving in with your father is an option, you might want to seriously consider it. It would be hard to leave the things you care about but living in a respectful environment might be worth some sacrifice.  Can you talk to your father about bringing your horse (even if you have to board it close by) and how often he could help you visit your friends and boyfriend, as well as your younger siblings?  Also, have you tried talking to your mom about how stressful the home environment is becoming? Let her know that you feel scared and intimidated by your stepfather’s behavior and that you hope she can support you and your siblings more.Finally, if your stepfather does cross the line and hits you, or if the verbal abuse gets too intense, you need to alert the authorities. You can call the police or call Child Protective Services directly. You can also speak to a teacher or your doctor and they will help you.As difficult as your home life is right now, you have some strengths that you can fall back on and future goals to help see you through. Whatever you do, don’t give up.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m having existential issues. I have very good affect regulation and impulse control. I am on medication and have been in about 2 years of psychotherapy. I’ve struggled with suicidal ideation, not as a function of seeking attention or because I don’t feel loved or valued (I very much am) – I am also accomplished and motivated and have a life full of things to do – I’m physically healthy. My primary psychological issues are PTSD from extreme childhood abuse and neglect and I have almost no ability to attach to people. I’ve found suicide to be a rational expression of what I feel is a pointless life that I don’t care for anymore. I need to talk to someone about this in a philosophical sense and my therapist is on the side of life and it is dangerous to her professionally to help me with this issue. I also cannot get the personal (though still detached) reflections due to boundary issues. I really REALLY want to explore what I feel about death the way I may explore the issue of abortion (I’m pro-choice but anti-abortion for myself). With suicide I feel I am pro-choice there too but I’m wondering if it’s the right option for me. I need someone to consult with who isn’t professionally obligated to “save me” and can be impartial? Like a spiritual advisor? Or are there therapists you can sign a pre-release to make sure they do not get bothered for malpractice if I choose to die? [/INST]  You are essentially asking for assisted suicide. Assisted suicide is almost universally illegal. I am aware of no cases in which a mental health professional has or would knowingly agree to assist a client in ending their life.In virtually all cases of assisted suicide, the individual who is considering suicide is experiencing agonizing physical circumstances. Their distress and pain are typically the result of an incurable medical illness, the prolonging of which could be characterized by some as tortuous or inhumane.With regard to psychological problems, under no circumstance is suicide an appropriate choice or action. Research supports this assertion. Case after case, study after study, has shown that suicide ideation is temporary and fleeting. The feelings eventually dissipate. Studies of individuals who have survived their suicide attempts report that survivors strongly regret their actions and were grateful to have lived. Many of those individuals feel so strongly about their mistakes that they have dedicated their lives to suicide prevention.You stated that you are loved but that you believe you’re not. That is evidence of an inability to see reality as it is. Nothing is more important than one’s ability to see reality clearly. Simply believing in the truth could prevent you making the biggest mistake of your life.The inability to see reality clearly might also be a sign of depression. Individuals who are depressed are more likely to consider suicide than individuals who are not depressed. Those around you do love you but you do not believe them. It could be that you do not feel worthy of their love so you deny that it exists. Feeling unworthy of love is a signature characteristic of depression.I would highly recommend that you strongly reconsider your plans. Take suicide “off the table.” Do not allow it to be an option. Realize that psychological pain can be eliminated from your life. It is often a matter of finding the right therapist or the right medication, or a combination of both. Explore your existential questions through meeting with a variety of mental health professionals. Become familiar with the work of Abraham Maslow, Viktor Frankl, and M. Scott Peck, all of whom wrote extensively about existential and psychological problems.Finally, consider how suicide would forever alter the lives of those who love you. You may not believe that they love you but the reality is, as you have stated, they do. That is reality. In all probability, your loss would be devastating and their suffering would be immense.I sincerely hope that you get the help that you desire. Please take care. </s>"

It’s more of a flashed image or stationary statue that occasionally moves in response to the conversation (these “figures” have different voices, ideas, along with a conscience of their own but overall the conversations are very detailed) [/INST]  Sometimes when people ask a question, they already know the answer. Please listen to your wise inner self. You know this isn’t usual. You are troubled by it. You already know that you’ll need an objective, nonjudgmental counselor to help you figure it out. Those are enough reasons to talk to a professional who can help you sort out whether this is a problem that needs to be addressed or an unusual and creative way you solve problems. A trained mental health counselor will know the kinds of questions to ask to make sense of the situation.

I occasionally binge and although I am in a “healthy” weight range, I would like to be thinner and my husband likes very slim girls. [/INST] If I asked your husband, I’m sure he would say that he is only trying to help. What he doesn’t realize is that help that isn’t asked for is rarely helpful. His “help” has become another source of anxiety for you. Since the primary way you handle anxiety is overeating, his efforts are backfiring. This is your problem and only you can resolve it. The fact is that you have taken charge of yourself and you are making a reasonable effort to manage a long-term problem. Good for you!The Weight Watchers program is fantastic for helping people change their relationship to food. You are losing at a responsible rate and you’ve added exercise to your life. It’s enough. You will undoubtedly slip up every now and then. Most people do. What’s important is that you get back to the program by the next meal and learn what you can from the difficult moments.The way out of the fight with your husband is to drop your end of it. There can be no fight if you decline the invitation. The issue has become so toxic between you that it’s going to take time to turn things around. For now, look for support at WW meetings and don’t talk with him about what you’re doing. The results will speak for themselves eventually. If he comments, simply thank him for caring, calmly state that you are handling it, and change the subject. You don’t need to apologize, justify or explain. In return, refrain from commenting on his diet or eating habits. That’s his business. There are plenty of other things to talk about in life besides diet and food. Focus on the positive and find ways to enjoy your husband that don’t involve food. You’ll both feel better.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve been dealing with this issue for a little over 7 years. It started out as becoming easily agitated, to the point I’d break things, rip up clothing, and shut out anyone close to me. It progressed to feeling watched and feeling as though people were trying to poison or kill me. As of today, I can’t form relationships, as sometimes I tend to do things I don’t mean, such as laughing when told something serious or showing no emotion at all. People are trying to read my mind and steal my thoughts, and I hear voices of people telling me to do terrible things. I don’t know what to do at this point. I have a hard time maintaining a job, as there are days I can’t even leave the house out of fear. I’ve never seen anyone about this, as I’m told I just need a strong faith in God. [/INST] Faith in God is good but it’s not a substitute for mental health treatment. Sometimes very religious people believe that prayer is the only thing that can help. If praying alone worked, then we would have no worldly problems. Praying is good, but perhaps God answers you by directing you to a therapist.You’ve been experiencing symptoms for seven years and they seem to have progressed. One should always be proactive with their mental health and with health in general. If you noticed a lump on your back, for instance, you’d be ill-advised to ignore it. If that lump turned out to be cancer you would have wasted value time. The importance of early diagnosis in cancer and mental illness cannot be overemphasized. I’m obviously not suggesting that you have cancer. I’m simply trying to make the point that early detection and appropriate care for a potential mental illness is immensely important for your overall psychological health and well-being. Put more simply, you should not ignore your symptoms.As you know, when you don’t feel well psychologically, it affects all aspects of your life including, work, school, relationships, and so forth. Most mental illnesses are highly treatable, especially in the early stages of development. The sooner one receives treatment, the easier it will be to restore one’s psychological health.I would suggest contacting a mental health professional to assist you in determining what might be wrong and most importantly, to begin treatment. Going to therapy doesn’t mean you are weak or that you would have to stop praying (if you pray). It’s nothing like that. Religion and therapy are not mutually exclusive. You can do both — pray and seek therapy. In fact, it’s not uncommon for churches to offer therapeutic services. Think of a therapist like you would a dentist or anyone who has spent many years in school learning highly specific skills. Your goals in therapy are ultimately yours to decide but generally they are to reduce one’s symptoms, restore one’s level of functioning and to live a happy, more satisfied life.You can start the process of seeking professional help by contacting your primary care physician and asking for a referral. They often are aware of mental health resources and providers in the community. Another option is to contact your insurance company and ask them for a referral. If you don’t have insurance, contact your local community mental health center and ask how they can help. Community mental health centers often offer free or very low-cost services to those in need. Do whatever is necessary in order to get the treatment you need. Treatment does work, but you have to be willing to try it. Good luck and please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been married for 4 years now. We met 6 months before getting married. My wife was a virgin when she married me and I was not. Our relationship is great and we love each other a lot. No problems. And if we have any arguments we resolve our conflicts before we go to be that night. [/INST]  What a disappointment for you both. Yes – both. You lack the sexual connection you so want with the woman you love. She finds that sex is not what she thought it would be. You are frustrated. She feels like she is always disappointing you. This could erode your marriage. Actually it already is.Cheating is not the answer if you want to save the marriage. Having a relationship that works in every other way is not something to throw away easily.My suggestion is that you take a very big step back. Instead of pushing sex, invite some very tender talk. Instead of focusing on your needs, ask your wife just what it is that makes her so unable to be sexually close. Did something happen to her at some time that left her unable to enjoy sex? Did she shut her sexuality so decisively off in order to stay a virgin until marriage that she can’t switch it back on? Has she been afraid she might hurt your feelings if she told you that there is something in your approach that overwhelms her? Stay as compassionate and loving as you know how. Explore her feelings without judgment. This isn’t a debate. It’s a loving discovery of what she has experienced and what she needs.If there is something about sex that upsets her so, let her know that you want to help her through it. Suggest that the two of you might benefit from working with a couples therapist to help you learn how to communicate better when a topic is scary or difficult. If she really, truly is clear that there is no underlying reason for her lack of libido, suggest that she might want to have a complete physical checkup including a visit to an endocrinologist. Sometimes it’s in the hormones, not in the head.I am concerned that the topic of sex has become so difficult for the two of you that you aren’t intimate in other important ways as well. Talking through this issue with love and understanding may help.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am in a close and very tender relationship with someone, who might be suffering from PPD. He has been reading the symptoms and the characteristics and feels they totally describe him. He is willing to get some help. He has a great mind, is quite mature emotionally and is open to discussing his problems of mistrust and his ungrounded suspicions. So he manages to have his paranoid thoughts under control most of the time, though I dont know with what cost. [/INST]  Your boyfriend should be evaluated by both a therapist and a psychiatrist. The therapist might suggest therapy. The psychiatrist will most likely focus on medication. In most cases, both therapy and medication are integral parts of a comprehensive treatment approach to mental health problems. He should also have a medical evaluation to rule out a possible physiological problem.If he agrees to therapy, it would be advantageous for both of you to meet with the therapist. Therapists often request at least one session with a client’s significant other, especially when there are problems in the relationship. The therapist may request to see each of you individually. He or she may want to see you together; it depends on the therapist.If your boyfriend chooses not to seek treatment, then I would highly recommend that you see a therapist. A therapist could assist you in dealing with the anger you have toward your boyfriend. A therapist could also offer guidance about what your “limits” should be in the relationship. The therapist, based on a detailed description of his behavior, might also be able to determine if your boyfriend has a mental health disorder.His behavior is unusual, and it is damaging the relationship. He should seek help immediately. If he is unwilling to seek help and his behavior does not change, you will need to decide whether you should or should not stay in the relationship. The “find help” tab can assist you in locating mental health professionals in your community. I wish you the best of luck. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: When I was in middle school, my acquaintances would repeatedly slap me in the butt at the lunch table and that made me feel very uncomfortable. That happened regularly. They used to say “I love you” sarcastically. One of them said I would go to college at “Touch my penis state.” They used to make me try to push someone off the lunch table and then they blamed me for it to the authorities. One of them poked me in the back with a pencil in the middle of class. I remember a day when I was in gym 1 of the guys said “You got pretty eyes” sarcastically and another one poked me in the stomach. I was kicked in the back in the locker room stalls when I was changing. One day a guy slapped me in the butt and then said “get your butt away from me man!” and another guy was laughing when that happened. I got my lunchbox stolen the year after that. I still remember all the sequence of events that happened in middle school and I still feel all the negative emotions and all the emotional pain that I felt at that time. I still hold a grudge against the middle school. And the few times I went to the teachers about it, they thought I was lying and called me crazy. I am afraid that I might have post tramatic stress disorder right now because of that. [/INST]  I’m so very sorry you were so mercilessly bullied. I’m furious that teachers didn’t take you seriously. You were right to ask for help. They were wrong and unprofessional in their response. It’s no wonder to me that you are concerned.BUT — this is a big “but” — not all kids who go through traumatic experiences like yours become traumatized. In fact, studies show that two thirds of people who go through difficult times come through okay. This is usually because of a combination of resiliency factors: They know they are loved by people who care for them. They have people to talk to and who try to help. They are born with a more flexible temperament. They figure out ways to hold onto their positive self-esteem despite the bullying.Not everyone is so lucky to have those resiliency factors going for them. These are the people who are traumatized by the trauma. They usually show a complex of the symptoms of PTSD that are outlined in detail in the DSM-5. Briefly, symptoms are in 4 categories:So the answer to your question is complicated. If you are one of the lucky ones who already had a lot of resiliency, you may have weathered the bullying, learned from the experience, and maybe even become stronger for it. If, however, you felt helpless to stop the bullying, there was no one to turn to, and you didn’t already have a fairly strong sense of self, you may have developed symptoms of PTSD.If you think you did, please don’t diagnose yourself. Talk to a mental health professional to establish whether you have the disorder and whether you need some treatment. If so, the good news is that there is solid evidence-based treatment for PTSD. The bullying of middle school doesn’t have to shadow your life forever.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, to start off i want to ask why i have the urge to kill someone, i keep getting ideas and plans to kill someone i dont like. It occurs at random moments but more often when im pissed. I make real plans for it, things like injecting them with poison or making it look like an accident. And there is also another thing, i am really distant from other people and dont really have a social life anymore, i like it but am also unhappy about it at the same time. As that builded up i also started to have more strange things like talking to myself and talking very much like a toddler, people rarely understand me if i dont try hard enough. I also have somewhat my own religion, and i am the god. When i am falling asleep i always feel that i must lay down very normally within ten seconds because else some evil ghost sees it, but after that my guard ghost sets up a force field, so i dont have to care anymore. I also had some really strange hallucinations when i was younger, like seeing beheaded bodys with their heads next to them staring at me in the middle of the night, waking me up instantly. And also a sort of eaten apple thats tinted red with a birds mouth making a scary noise and chasing me. And theres more of those things. I dont thinks this is normal so please help. [/INST]  You are concerned about the normality of your experiences and I share your concerns. It’s not normal to have the urge to kill. It may indicate that you are feeling out of control, not thinking clearly and you may be a danger to others.Your symptoms also seem to suggest that you have difficulty distinguishing reality from non-reality. The urge to kill, isolation and losing touch with reality are concerning symptoms.I would strongly urge you to have a psychiatric evaluation. The purpose of an evaluation is to determine if a mental health condition is present and if so, to identify the most appropriate intervention. Ask your primary care physician for a referral for a psychiatric evaluation. Make sure to involve your parents in this matter.You should also go to the hospital if you feel out of control or believe that you may harm someone else or feel that you are losing touch with reality.Intervention is important in cases where an individual feels that he or she might be dangerous or is losing touch with reality. With the right treatment, your symptoms can be controlled or eliminated, allowing you to return to a healthy state of mind. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I don’t really know I haven’t been diagnosed I just don’t feel normal. I feel like my whole life probably mainly since the start of school I’ve struggled to connect with people and be myself. I feel like I’ve always been SO focused on what other people think and I just feel so awkward most of the time. I try and force myself to change and it comes of worse. I have people I can talk to but I feel like I’ve never had a friendship that I feel completely comfortable in. I think I have social anxiety mixed with other stuff. I just don’t feel normal. Had a boy that liked me and I really liked him recently and we had great chats over text, felt really close but in person I felt anxious and I just couldn’t open up and I hate myself for it, so it didn’t work out. I just want to be free and live to be honest. Ok so heres my question. Ive had 3 sessions with a psychologist so far and I feel like it wasn’t how I expected. I kind of really want to see a psychiatrist and try some medication but my parents are really against that, but they don’t see how desperate I am- Im way to scared to tell them I have suicidal thoughts a lot because I know they do so much for me, I just feel really desperate and want to try out medication so I’m just wondering if you can offer some advice on what approach I should take to this situation. Thankyou. P.S I know this is not a crisis hotline. I’ve had thoughts from time to time but I don’t think I could do that to my parents. I just mainly want advice on the whole medication thing. [/INST]  Many people benefit from psychiatric medication, but there are pros and cons. One of the positive aspects about medication is that it can decrease the severity of your symptoms. You might have fewer mood swings and feel your emotions less intensely.Alternatively, some people complain that medication blunts all of their emotions both good and bad. In that way, the medication might only serve as a Band-Aid for your problems and not a cure. You should read more about the pros and cons of medication by doing research and or by talking to your therapist.You shouldn’t give up on counseling. You’ve only just started. Three sessions is just a beginning. You said that you didn’t “feel like … how I expected” but you didn’t elaborate on what you meant. Give it more time. It’s good that you’re in counseling. It is where you should be. A good counselor can teach you to correct the problems you have described.Ideally, if you do begin taking medication, you should do it in conjunction with some form of psychotherapy. Most psychologists will work in conjunction with psychiatrists when they feel that medication would be helpful. Medication alone generally offers very limited relief. Therapy may be enough but medication can certainly be added if indicated. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] In the rare event that I hang out with my friends, even for just a few hours, my long distance girlfriend really struggles with it because she has no friends of her own and she is very lonely. Even though I text her the whole time I’m gone she just seems to shut down emotionally and all I can get is one word responses. I’ve shut my friends out of my life more and more over the years because it’s not worth it to me to have her shut down on me. She has suffered from severe depression for many years and I feel like this may be a factor. She describes it as her brain just shutting her down and she doesn’t feel she has control of these feelings. My hope is to get an opinion on what may be causing her to feel this way and what I can do to help her. She has bad anxiety, separation anxiety, and depression and I think that could very well be a factor. I just want to figure out how to try and help her work through this. I would like to be able to see my friends without feeling guilt and sad that she shuts down. It really frustrates me sometimes and I don’t know how to help her. [/INST]   You having to tiptoe around your long-distance girlfriend’s emotions isn’t healthy for you or for her. Limiting your social network and cutting back on seeing your friends because she shuts down will eventually create resentment in you. While it may not be done maliciously it is manipulative. The problems is you can’t be you in the relationship without it throwing her off. Over time this will put you in a terrible position because unless you make her emotional well-being your top priority in life she will have a reaction. This never works because you have to keep restricting yourself in the service of her depression, anxiety, and loneliness.The work here is for you to help her understand she has to figure out how to cope with her reaction. You need to be very supportive of her struggle, but only by explaining that you are not going to not see your friends because it makes her upset. Move toward the conflict by encouraging her to think about what she can do to help herself. The key to this is to set a boundary about what it is you are willing to do for her, and with your help — help her find ways to take responsibility for her emotional well-being.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: I’m confused on what exactly has been happening to me. I have never been to a professional for a diagnosis, but I think something is definitely wrong and that this not normal. [/INST]  You began your letter with the statement that you haven’t seen a professional. Why not? You have tried everything you already know to help yourself. That doesn’t make you hopeless. It only means that you have run through your own solutions. A professional can offer you new ways to understand your situation and new ways to fix it.My best suggestion is for you to follow your own instincts and make an appointment with a therapist. There is no reason to continue to feel so horrible every day. There is no reason to let your anxiety “ruin” your life. Really. You deserve the compassionate help a therapist can offer.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in Canada: The relationship with my mom has worsened due to a lie I told back in February, which I took full responsibility for and I am aware that hiding my depression from her and the fact that I was seeing a physiologist without her knowing was not okay, but I felt as if she wouldn’t understand, because she’s always told me I make a big deal out of everything and that I want to make it seem like I’m a victim when I cry, so I was ashamed to tell her and face her criticism. [/INST] What a mess! I’m so sorry your mother’s relationship with you and your sister has deteriorated so much. I’m guessing that everyone in the family is feeling emotionally fragile and exhausted. Believing your troubles are your boyfriend’s fault may be a way your mom protects herself from feeling responsible. Worrying you and threatening you and your sister tells me she is feeling bankrupt. She just doesn’t know what to do with two teenaged daughters. She’s stressed. You are stressed. I suspect your sister is too.I agree that lying about seeing a psychologist wasn’t the best way to get the help you need. But it looks to me that taking charge of getting some help for yourself and maybe your family was a healthy move on your part. Please talk to your psychologist about all you’ve told me. Ask if  you should transfer to a family therapist so that you, your sister, and your mother can work on creating a more peaceful home during your teen years.You didn’t mention your father. If he is in the picture, he should definitely be included in such counseling.I wish you well. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, I’m a 17-year-old boy. I was admitted into acute care for mania and self-harm after my father passed away. I was diagnosed with severe PTSD (not acute, because I’d been diagnosed in the past with it) and Bipolar 1 Disorder with Psychosis and Mixed Episodes. But I don’t think that’s the case, my psychosis isn’t only when I’m manic or depressed, it’s even when I’m stable. I’ll hear voices all the time, I’m almost always paranoid or delusional. But because I have some insight into this, I’ve been told I’m faking before. I don’t feel like I’m faking though, an example of a hallucination was I was checking my air conditioning vent and I saw a very vivid face in the vent, and I had a severe panic attack. I’ll hear voices calling my name all the time, or bells ringing, or children laughing at 2am. It’s horrifying and I don’t know what to do. Is this Schizoaffective? I even have the disorganised speech, it’s not very intense but I constantly have people asking me what I’m talking about because what I’m saying, even though it makes sense to me, doesn’t make sense to them. I know I have the major depressive episodes and the mania, but the psychosis doesn’t line up with it. I’m not always in a flux of either one or the other. Thank you for taking the time to read this. [/INST]  If you were admitted into 10 different psychiatric emergency rooms and evaluated by 10 different physicians, you may receive 10 different psychiatric diagnoses. Diagnosis is not an exact science. That’s why many clinicians, myself included, believe that diagnosis is often less important than finding the right treatment.Psychiatric diagnosis is especially difficult for youth. Adolescents are in the process of growing, developing and maturing. For that reason, many clinicians feel uncomfortable diagnosing adolescents with a mental illness.Medication is the primary treatment for psychosis. You may need to try several medications to find what works best for you. Trial and error is a normal part of the treatment process. The fact that you are continuing to have symptoms, despite being in treatment, is concerning. It would suggest that adjustments are needed. Finding the best symptom improvement is where your focus should be.Counseling should also be added to your treatment plan. It will help you learn alternative ways of coping with unpleasant and difficult emotions. The death of a parent is difficult for anyone, at any age. Counseling is the ideal place to safely grieve the loss of your father. It will also teach you better methods of coping so that you will be less inclined to engage in self-harm. People who engage in self-harm often do so because they lack psychologically healthy coping skills. Counseling can remedy many, if not all, of the problems you have described. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care. </s>"

However, newer issues have really started taking there toll on me when I suffered an injury to my neck.

I admire your grit in managing the struggle and seeking a solution. Secondly, I can’t help but noticing the clarity and complexity of articulation in your email. If this is the kind of quality you can produce when you are not up to par, then your coping strategies may be working better than you think.I have two suggestions. The first is a very specific type of meditation known as Tonglen. It is designed to help you manage the stress directly. My guess is the meditation you were doing was more generalized — which is always a good strategy — but you may find this one a bit more targeted.Secondly I would seek out a therapist trained in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT). This form of therapy is typically very effective when there is a specific activator, such as your thinking or working, which can be targeted more precisely.Write us back and let us know how it goes.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m prone to overreacting every once in a while, I’ll usually throw a fit in my room at night and try to be quiet (hitting pillows, crying, screaming into pillows) which I’m sure is ordinary. The real problem is I seem to be missing something. I’m too…open-eyed, I guess. I sit around with a stupid smile on my face. At school, I feel uncomfortable if people try to sit next to me at lunch, so I sit on my own and read, and this doesn’t bother me at all! But my mother thinks I’m hurting myself (socially), but she doesn’t seem to understand how strained I feel when I’m put into a situation I don’t like. On the other hand, when I do feel chatty, I always seem to mention topics that aren’t related, or I steer the conversation towards me, or I’m unintentionally mean. I try to remind myself not to behave that way, but every time I talk it seems like I mess everything up. I think about things no one else really cares about. I’m not sure if my personality is weird or if something is actually going on with my brain that doesn’t happen with everyone else, because even introverts (i think) have their own little group of friends to sit with, even if they don’t talk, but I feel stifled and nervous when I haven’t started talking on my own terms. I’ve started noticing that I take nudges and pushes a little too seriously, and when I try to replicate that playful atmosphere with my siblings I end up hurting them or angering them. Everyone gives me a hard time because of it. My siblings make me feel guilty. Once I had politely declined an offer from a nice girl who wanted me to come and sit with her and her friends, and when I later on related it to my mother, she was upset that I didn’t accept the offer and told me that I wasn’t going to make many friends if I was rude like that. There’s also the fact that I act a lot like a child and can be loud and annoying, and I feel like I interrupt people all the time. I just love being alone and feel agitated if someone, like one sibling of mine often does, impedes my private space unannounced. Thank you for listening. [/INST]  Being a teenager is difficult, much more so than many people realize. Most teenagers can relate to your experiences. All of the things that you have written about have probably been felt and are being felt by teenagers across the world. They worry about fitting in. They want people to like them. They worry about embarrassing themselves in front of others, and so on.Your mother seems to be concerned about your wanting to be alone. Her concerns may be valid. The key to knowing if there’s a problem is determining the reason you want to be alone. If it’s because you want to collect your thoughts or read a book or focus on a project, then those are normal and healthy reasons. If it’s driven by nervousness or fear, then that’s a problem. It might suggest that your avoidance of people is due to anxiety. It would be unhealthy to avoid social situations because of fear. Doing so would reinforce your fear and could make your anxiety worse.It’s normal to want to be alone, sometimes, but not all of the time. It’s expected that you would want to socialize and make friends. You might try talking to your mother about this issue or better yet, consulting the school guidance counselor or a therapist. Therapists specialize in understanding relationships and social interaction. You could greatly benefit from their professional advice and guidance. Please take care. </s>"

She is mostly in a helpless state being tied down or held down and molested in these dreams receiving physical abuse and pain. She has a history of childhood sexual abuse and these dreams have been there since childhood. Most of these dreams start by recalling the memory of the said child abuse where she goes back to being a helpless little kid. She has a self-blaming and self-victimizing attitude when depressed. I recently took her to a therapist and she is dealing with the issues and feeling much better in coping with it. I would like to have a second opinion on this issue.

Adults can disagree without getting physical. I can understand why your family is concerned.You say you love this man. But you’ve been with him since your were only 17. It’s important to consider whether you are in love or in “habit”. Because you are used to each other doesn’t necessarily mean that you are meant to be together for life. He may make you happier than you’ve ever been but at your age you haven’t been an adult long enough to know how happy you could be.Based on what you shared, I encourage you to take a big step back and to think about if he is a man you would choose now.

By our means me, my twin brother & my mother. [/INST]  Thank you for writing. I can’t respond to everything in your email but let me offer a few thoughts:First, regarding your difficulties with women: Please don’t be so hard on yourself. Your problem with interacting with women is not unusual, even if you think so. You didn’t have a positive role model of manhood from your father, so you didn’t learn how to relate to women in a respectful and loving way from him.Social skills are learned. They are not in-born. You need a safe place to learn them and to get some practice. I have a number of suggestions:First, get involved in some kind of activity that includes single women your age. When people focus on an activity (a charity, a sport, a building project), they get to know each other gradually over time. It takes the anxiety level down since the focus is on the activity, not on each other.Watch chick flicks. Yes, watch movies and study them as carefully as you studied for exams. Although the romances are idealized, they will give you some idea of how to relate. It’s like learning a new language. Memorizing those dialogues our teachers made us learn provided a template for interaction.Individual therapy with a female counselor may also help. Like the group. it provides a safe place to ask your questions and to get feedback.Finally, consider joining an online forum here at PsychCentral. You can get good advice and support from the members.Do not get involved with prostitutes as a sad substitution. Such encounters are not a model for normal relationships with women. They may give you an outlet for sexual frustration but they will damage your ability to relate to the women you want to be with.Regarding your work issues: A couple of times you said you “used to be a nerd” as if being a nerd is a bad thing. It’s not if it is defined as being intensely interested in mechanics or sciences. If you were seeing me for therapy, I would want to explore with you why you gave that up since you did well in your exams and in obtaining your first job. I really think it would be useful for you to talk to a therapist about what happened that made you become so discouraged.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  Since I was a child, I was taught that females must do everything for the males. Growing up to my father drinking everyday, to come home to beat my mother, to then beat us. When he was not drunk, he would make us pick out a weapon that he would hit us with. I guess that somehow it clicked into my older brothers head that it was ok to do the same thing to us. From 6 to 13 yrs old, I was sexually abused by my older siblings, which is my brother and sister. There has also been numerous times where family relatives have groped me, and touched me in inappropriate places. [/INST]  I am sorry you had to endure many years of unpleasant experiences because of your family. You grew up in a toxic and negative environment. You were neglected, molested, abused and left to fend for yourself. Despite this you managed to graduate high school and stop using drugs on your own. Given what you had to endure it’s important to highlight how significant these achievements are. I know you’re not feeling very celebratory at the moment but please be very proud of these accomplishments. They’re a testament to your resilience.I can’t answer the question of why your family treated you in the manner that they did. I’d need more information about your parents to answer the ever-elusive “why?” question. Generally it’s probably because they have their own psychological problems. If we analyzed their lives and behavior we’d probably find that they suffer from a host of psychological issues. Psychologically healthy individuals would never treat their children or anyone else in the manner that you were treated. Clearly something is wrong. They might be psychologically unhealthy or they may simply be bad parents. It’s difficult to know for certain.Knowing “why” your parents behave in the manner they do does little to help you overcome the damage you’ve sustained as a result of your upbringing. You are at the point in your life where you’re considering suicide. Now is not the time to analyze “why.” Now is the time to focus on saving yourself by getting help and support.Being kicked out of your parents house at this point might be a blessing. Let it be the turning point in your life. Not living with your parents allows you to be free of their toxic environment.Right now you need support. Try to find a local mental health clinic or related clinic in your area. Mental health clinics usually offer support and counseling from case managers, outreach workers, social workers and therapists. In addition, many clinics offer programs that help individuals secure housing and job assistance. They might even be able help you enroll in a college program or find you funding for school. You need all of these services and you need them right away. At the very least please seek out some form of mental health assistance for your depression and suicidal ideation. It’s imperative that you find some agency or clinic that can assist you. Please do this as soon as possible. Start this process by checking the yellow and white pages.Also know this: you grew up with very difficult life circumstances. What you had to endure was not fair. It’s going to be hard to overcome what you’ve experienced but it’s highly likely you’ll succeed in life if you keep trying. Try not to let your past dictate your future. It’s not going to be easy but as an adult you have the power to positively alter your future. You have the control, not your parents. They can’t hurt you any longer. Also worth mentioning once more is the fact that you were able to graduate high school and stop using drugs. This is a “big deal” because it means that you’re smart enough to recognize the value of education. You also realized on your own the harmful effects of drugs. You made it through school successfully while having to live through abuse and neglect at home. This is evidence of your mental toughness and ability to withstand difficult life circumstances. These are very positive and encouraging qualities about you. Let your intelligence and resiliency lead you out of your difficult family life and onto a better and more hopeful future. The first step towards a better life starts with getting help and support immediately. I wish you luck. Thanks for writing. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Fiji: My best friend and I always fight and she finally said we can’t be friends anymore. Please don’t see this as a teenage problem. I sent her many messages and she did not respond. I told her I was hurting a lot, she didn’t bother. [/INST]  I am so, so sorry that you are hurting so much. You are wise not to try to chase your former friend. You’ve been hurt enough. You don’t need to put yourself through another rejection,I’m seeing a pattern in your relationships that may be difficult for you to consider. You seem to repeatedly find yourself in relationships where the other person is emotionally less invested than you are. Your boyfriend cheated. Your Form 7 friend distanced on purpose. This most current friend has blamed you for any problems in the friendship and called you a drama queen.I don’t think fixing this relationship is wise or healthy. Instead, I strongly urge you to talk with a counselor in order to figure out why you put yourself in relationships where you give more than you get. Unless you do, you are likely to continue to fall for people who will reject you. You deserve better.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My mom and I have had issues for four years. They keep getting worse no matter what I try to do. She makes me feel worthless and yells at me over every simple mistake I make. She tells me I’m not going to have a future/ I won’t do anything with my life on a day to day basis. She makes me feel so bad about myself that I want to die and I feel unwanted. Because of this and other problems I self harm a lot and I sometimes have suicidal thoughts although I don’t think It would come to that. I tried to run away from home last year because it got so bad and it only made it worse. I also have tried not talking to my mom but she always finds something to yell at me for. She hasn’t spoken to me like a real person in a long time because she always yells. She’s told me that she hates me and loves my brother and sister more than me and tells me how much of a disappointment I am. I want to get help to make me feel better and stop her from saying these things to me but I don’t want her to know she is why I want help. I also am too afraid to talk to any counselors at school or my friends about it because I think they won’t believe me and will think I’m being a moody teenager. I’m scared to ask for help from anyone I know because they would think of me different and judge me. Please tell me what I should do about this. [/INST]  You should speak to the school counselor about this issue. You have nothing to fear. Counselors don’t judge people. It is their job to help people. They spend years rigorously training to help people who are having problems just like yours. They can help you if you ask.You are concerned that the counselors will see you as simply a “moody teenager.” You seem to be worried that you will not be taken seriously. I don’t think that will happen. Moody teenagers don’t engage in self-harm or have suicidal thoughts and counselors know this. They can’t help you if you don’t tell them what’s wrong.As soon as you have the opportunity, speak to your school counselor. Tell him or her about what you wrote in this letter. If it’s easier, take this letter with you. It might help the counselor begin to understand how you are feeling. I hope that you will take my advice and realize that you have nothing to fear. Help is available but you have to be willing to ask for it, to receive it. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have a real catch 22 situation which may sound trivial BUT my job which I love requires me to maintain a social media presence that I hate it & posting photos of myself is really not something I like doing but without my job/business suffers I try to force myself to do it but sometimes I just can’t. It’s not a body image thing it’s more I feel like a dick doing it and it seems very contrived & superficial but the only one suffering as a result of not doing it is me. Is there a way around this? [/INST]  Perhaps there are alternative ways to increase business without being active on social media. Of course any alternative ways would have to be acceptable to your employer. You can present them with your ideas and they may be open to a change in your job duties. Otherwise, if you want to keep your job, you will have to follow their instructions or they may be looking for your replacement.We often have to do things that we don’t want to do. Part of life involves doing things that you do not necessarily like or would choose yourself. Many people would rather spend time with their friends and families than go to work but they need the money to survive. They go to work even though they would rather be doing other, more pleasurable things.Without knowing more information about your employer’s flexibility regarding your job requirements, I don’t know if you have the option of not maintaining a social media presence. You might ask them if changes could be made but if not, you will have to do it in order to keep your job. In that case, try to make the best out of a less than ideal situation. Good luck with your efforts. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I am currently 17 and a junior in high school. I am in dire need of medicine to treat my mental illness. I’ve been diagnosed with severe OCD and it’s truly taking control of my life. The anxiety I get from it has changed me completely and I can’t do anything I used to. I have intense intrusive thoughts that keep me up every night (I haven’t slept yet, it’s 8am on the dot and I’m really unable to sleep) and sometimes the thoughts go as far that I think about harming myself or worse. [/INST]  I’m concerned that you are so focused on getting medicine for the OCD that you aren’t looking at the whole picture.Yes, you may be a “hormonal” teen, but that doesn’t mean that your distress should go ignored. The first stop should be with your regular doctor to make sure your hormone levels are normal and that you are generally healthy. Some of what you are reporting could be caused by endocrine issues.Do also talk with your doctor about your sleep disorder. It may be more important than you think. You can find information about how to normalize your sleep cycle on the Internet. Do your best to follow recommendations and get yourself back into a regular sleep pattern. I have a guess that doing so will help calm down the OCD at least a little.Since you have been diagnosed with OCD, I’m assuming that a qualified mental health counselor did the diagnosing. Return to that professional for help in developing a treatment plan and in talking with your parents. Meanwhile, there are a number of excellent self-help books available that can help you learn to manage the obsessional thinking. Go to Amazon or Barnes and Noble and search for a title that appeals to you.Finally, you are much too isolated. Frequent moves and attending school online means you are not having the experiences that most teens need to emotionally grow. Your mom may be right that you need to “get out of yourself” but that is difficult to do when your only social outlet is with you!Online relationships can be satisfying but they are not the same as participating in the social environment that school offers. You need a few best girl friends to talk to about your experiences, to normalize at least some of what you are going through, and to share laughs, fun times, music, and hanging out as well as mutual support.I think you need to go back to school! Yes, you have moved a lot. But, as other kids who are frequent movers will tell you, you can see that as a plus, not just a minus. You have the chance to make friends in lots of places. You have interesting experiences to share with new people. You can develop an ease with doing new things and meeting new people that will serve you well as an adult. It may be scary at first, but put on your big girl pants and get out there! Getting more social experience now will help prepare you for when you finish school and go on to a job or college.Six months may seem like a long time. But it seems to me to be about the amount of time you need to follow the recommendations I’ve made. If you are still suffering from significant OCD, you will no longer need your folks’ permission to make an appointment with a psychiatrist.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a 13 Year old girl in the U.S.: For a long time now, I’ve have doubts about my feelings and mental state. Sometimes I feel like nobody can relate to my issues. My mother and I believe I have Anxiety Disorder. The Anxiety makes tiny tasks like speaking to a new person, getting seconds for lunch at school and even serving cake to my own family at my own birthday hard and scary. [/INST]  Whenever I hear symptoms like yours, the first thing I suggest is a visit to your medical doctor. There are many physical problems that can cause anxiety and mood changes — especially at your age. If you are still seeing a pediatrician, you might want to request a referral to an endocrinologist. It’s important not to jump to the conclusion that the problem is mental before checking out the physical. If you do have a medical problem and it isn’t attended to, it could get worse.If are physically fine, then it would be helpful for you to see a therapist. It may be that you do have anxiety or you may be depressed. Depression doesn’t always show up as sadness. It can also show up as anger and feelings of emptiness. You also may have some unresolved issues regarding your father’s alcoholism and absence.A therapist will be able to assess the difficulty and will make recommendations for how to treat it. Since your mother is doing her best to be supportive, it would be helpful if you included her in the appointment. With some coaching, she may be able to provide you with more helpful support.I remind you that going for an assessment doesn’t obligate you to getting into therapy. You may or may not want to proceed. But the assessment alone may give you and your mom some new perspectives on your distressing feelings and what can be done about them.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ m lonely on the inside and outside. Any of my clumsy attempts to start conversation will be laughed at, so they should be stopped now. I’m not funny or interesting enough, I want to call myself ‘an open book’ but that’s just because there’s nothing exciting about me I could hide. I don’t have any talent or occupation I could justify my loneliness with. Every day a voice inside me tells me not to approach people, because I’m not wanted there and they’ll be better off without me. I pity myself and it makes me pathetic. Saying that I’m pathetic out loud only makes me more pathetic. I’m utterly childish, vapid and dull, but every time I try to improve, I feel like I’m losing my old self and it pushes me back. I feel myself old, ‘out of trend’ and so, so boring. Do I need to do something about it? Or maybe most people feel the same, and then I’m just making drama? *Sorry for being wordy. [/INST]  I am very sorry that you feel this way about yourself. If I were your therapist, I would ask about what proof you have for all of the negative things you believe about yourself. There is a high likelihood that you have no proof. In fact, there probably exists a great deal of evidence to the contrary.People often think untrue things about themselves because of problems like depression. Depression can trick the mind into believing unflattering things, that are not true. Negative thoughts lead to negative feelings.Sometimes negative thoughts arise when our parents or caregivers haven’t shown us enough love. If a person doesn’t feel loved, they might think it is because they were not worthy of being loved. When parents are not loving or affectionate, it’s often because they have psychological problems of their own that make it difficult for them to express love and affection. Eventually, children in these circumstances have to realize that they are lovable and valuable, even if their parents didn’t show them love. That can be a difficult lesson to learn but one that is necessary in order to be happy in our own lives.You are an ideal candidate for counseling. It would help you to replace false ideas with the truth. Once this occurs, more positive and healthy emotional reactions will follow. A therapist will also assist you in having better relationships with your peers. Ask your parents to assist you in finding a good therapist in your community. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] For most of my teenage years, life never seemed just right. I remember going through days putting on a smile, but at night cry myself to sleep. I started journaling when I was around 14. I still have the journals and usually write most in them when things start going really bad. The other night I got out the journal to put down an entry as I was enraged about how emotional I had been lately. After, I decided to take a look back at past writings. I realized that since I was around 15 I have been depressed. The worst part is that I have known about it for all these years, but I am just now accepting it. Recently, I have been feeling really down in the dumps and will either get mad easily or burst out into tears for no reason. Relationships that used to be strong or growing apart. The other day my sister, who was previously one of my best friends, and I got into an argument and she yelled “What is wrong with you?!” I have never told anyone about my problem, not even family. I feel like if I told them then they would treat me differently. I just don’t know what to do anymore. Who should I tell? Or should I not tell anyone? Please help me. [/INST]  I am sorry you are having such a difficult time. It is hard to deal with depression, especially when you are attempting to handle it yourself.You highlighted one of the benefits of keeping a journal, which is that you have a written record of your thoughts. In your case, it helped to determine just how long you’ve been depressed. It also helped you to see the progression of the depression.Your family is beginning to notice that something is wrong. You may not want to tell them the truth but soon you may have to. Your concern is that your family may treat you differently if they knew you were depressed. My presumption is that you are concerned that they will treat you harshly or think about you in a negative light. I don’t have many details about your specific family situation but most families would not react the way you fear. They most likely would want to help you.I encourage you to tell your parents about your depression. Ask your parents if they will take you to be evaluated by a mental health professional. If you feel that you cannot speak to your parents, then discuss your concerns with someone you trust and who you believe can assist you in accessing professional help.You have noticed that your depression is getting worse. The proper way to handle this situation is to seek help. Depression is a treatable condition. It is not something that you should have to live with. You should not feel ashamed. You did not cause your depression. Depression happened to you. Now, it is your responsibility to ask for the help that you deserve. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Scotland: I’m a 15 year old female who has suspected ASD since I was 11. I can’t get a diagnosis as my mum won’t take me and I can’t go alone but because I can’t tell people why I am the way I am I feel depressed and anxious. I want to help myself. My main problems are sensory overload, eye contact, social situations, expressions, routine change and sarcasm. I find it hard to go out in public and I am easily irritable by small things. If im out with my dogs and i havebto change my route slightly i want to do nothing more than scream and cry in frustration but i dont i keep it in however frusration can build up and it ends with me in my room crying and punching walls. Everyday i wish to wake up and for it to be gone. I suppose it isnt all bad Im very smart and know loads of facts. I love mental health and my favourite movies make me happier than most when i watch them. I rock back and forth or flap my hands when im excited and I rub my hands together, tap fingers and resit facts when overwhelmed. Nobody notices. One of my friends noticed how stressed i get when a class gets too noisy and can even recognise when I’m about to lash out because of stress. Nobody else notices and my Mum says I was never like this when I was younger yet I can remember being like this as long as I can remember which might be from the age of 3 or 4. Can I help myself? How? [/INST]  As you already probably know, an ASD diagnosis is only a label. What matters is what you do with it. And as you also probably already know, there are many especially creative, intelligent, and successful people on the Autism Spectrum.So the answer to your question is — of course you can help yourself. You can learn to manage you emotions and to contain your tendency to rock and flap when in public. You can train yourself to look people in the eye more often. And you can find ways to manage stressful environments. Most important, you can find ways to use your unique strengths and talents and develop your special areas of interest. Fortunately, there are lots of tools available on the Internet.I’m very sorry your parents aren’t interested in getting an evaluation. It wouldn’t hurt you. If you understood the degree to which you are on the spectrum, you might be able to access some services like special counseling or classes that would help you play to your strengths and work on the issues that get you so upset. If your school has a counselor, you might want to talk to her or him about what kinds of supports might be available to you at school. Your counselor might also help you talk with your parents.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I didn’t realize I was suffering from depression until many years into it. I finally went to a psychologist and psychiatrist when my life was falling apart. I felt awful and had felt awful for a very long time, but after getting on medications and feeling like a normal, happy person for a couple years, it all felt like an old unreal dream. So I decided to stop my medications. My doctors advised me against it, saying that if I had suffered more than 3 episodes, I should stay on medication indefinitely, but I had never “counted” my episodes. Really, it just felt like I was born with one long and nasty episode. I have been off my meds for a month now and I feel horrible. My anxiety is so bad that my whole body hurts from being so tense and shaky. I’m missing work either because I’m too busy crying or I just don’t want to deal with life. I feel lonely, sad, and hopeless. I feel like I am cursed for life. From what I have read and heard, depression occurs in episodes. But I feel like I am doomed to feel like this forever, having no respite unless I take high doses of medications. Is it possible that I just have a “lifetime long episode”? I only went to see a psychiatrist when I was 22, about a year after I moved out of my parents house. My parents are deniers of mental illness – the have a “pick yourself up by your bootstraps” / “you can’t possibly have depression” attitudes, so I always attributed my poor mental status to a character flaw. But when I reflect on my childhood and adolescence, I don’t ever remember being happy. I think I was always depressed. I cannot possibly live my life feeling this depressed but I don’t want to take medication for the rest of my life either. I haven’t even mentioned that my medications and behavioral therapies have done absolutely nothing to help my OCD. That I have heard can last a lifetime. I don’t think I can live like this. It’s getting to be too much. It can all be tolerated until you realize that, for the rest of your existence, none of this will go away. [/INST]  It would be helpful to know more about the trauma you experienced. It could have triggered these problems. Dissociative disorders are associated with trauma and symptoms such as losing track of time.People with psychotic disorders also describe similar symptoms but I cannot determine what’s wrong based on only a short paragraph. Without more information, it’s difficult to determine what’s wrong.It’s important that you are evaluated by a mental health professional. It’s especially important because of your losing track of time and the feeling that you’re losing control. Seek help as soon as possible. Please take care. </s>"

[/INST] Let’s see: You are willing to physically assault your coworkers and go to jail but you’re not willing to report to HR? I do understand how strongly you feel about the situation, but you aren’t making any sense. The price you would pay for getting even by hurting these people is much too high.You and your fiancee are in a hostile work environment. There are laws and company policies intended to protect workers like yourself. Human Resource departments are generally bound by rules of confidentiality.Do yourself and your fiancee a big, big favor and resist the impulse to get physical and take the problem through proper channels. If you don’t get a satisfactory response, consider getting a different job. Adjusting to a different job is preferable to adjusting to prison!I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I do not feel like I can express myself to other’s in an appropriate manner. What I mean is, I cannot confront someone without thinking that I have to make sure I am loud and clear. I think that because of this, it limits my relationships with people. I do not like that I have Schizophrenia, furthermore, I am wondering if I am Schizo-Effective..? My mother has Bi-Polar and, I think that I may also have this same disorder. I get frustrated easily, when other’s do not handle their own responsibilities or “problems” that they have. Not only that but, I also get upset if someone does not keep a structured format. I like for my day to at least have some kind of order and, to not be chaotic. I do not like when people betray my trust or, [un]intentionally hurt me or do something that irritates me. I make sure to be honest with them and, tell them my peeves. However, frankly, they do not take this serious. I find that to be disrespectful. Let alone, the fact that I have no one turn to for help. People think I am making this stuff up. It’s NO lie. I cannot tolerate people who do not take me serious and/or know when to joke appropriately. My life has been hell, however, I try to stay strong and make it in life. I just need some kind of guidance as to how to handle people whom I communicate with or with not. I feel really sad that my own girlfriend cannot even open up to me or communicate with me. She was really nice to me, when we first met and dated for a couple of months. Now, I think that she has turned against me or she is just sick of my illness. I am confused about how to handle all of this. [/INST]  It may be “you” or “them.” I only have your impressions of the situation so it’s difficult to determine with whom the problem lies. It may be you, or the people you are interacting with or both of you.When you confront someone, your stated goal is to make your message “loud and clear.” I’m not certain what is meant by that expression. By “loud and clear,” perhaps you mean that you’re aggressive. If so, people may find that unpleasant. They may perceive you as being “mean” or difficult to get along with.When you believe that someone is not “handling their own responsibilities,” I am curious if you tell them what you think. If so, they may see you as being rude. Offering unsolicited advice can be seen as impolite. Your motivation for offering your advice may stem from a true desire to help but realize that not everyone will see it that way.You also mentioned that you prefer to do things in a very structured way. If you impose this “structure” onto others, they may see you as being too rigid or too demanding. Friends and family may resent having to conform to your way of doing things. All aspects of relationships should be equal. In other words, it can’t be “your way” all the time.If this continues to be a problem, I would recommend seeing a therapist. A therapist could analyze your interactions with others and then advise you about what you might do better. He or she could also help to improve your social skills.Finally, you said that you have schizophrenia. Individuals with schizophrenia often have poor social skills. They may not be fully aware of how their behavior is affecting others. Many schizophrenia treatments include social skill-building exercises. If you choose to see a therapist, consider one who specializes in working with individuals with schizophrenia.I hope this helps. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  I have no idea why I think like this when I have a good life. I’m 16. I have dealt with occasional self harm since October 2011, but since 2012 summer its become more frequent. Not really often, only every couple weeks. I just don’t know why I even cut anymore, I just get caught up in the moment of anger or anxiety, so I cut myself. [/INST]  I can tell by your letter than you are a smart, sensitive young woman who thinks deeply about many things. Unfortunately, a little knowledge can indeed be dangerous. You are way over-thinking. The result is that you are making yourself anxious and upset about very normal feelings and thoughts. When people get over-anxious about things, they tend to get into quite a spin.The kids who get the most attention are either very high or very low achievers or behave in ways that scare other people. Just doing what you’re supposed to do and doing it reasonably well doesn’t get a lot of applause or a lot of concern. It’s not fair but it seems to be how it is. You like attention. You like excitement. But you haven’t found a way to be outstanding and haven’t found something to be so passionate about that it gives you the rush you crave. On top of that, it sounds like maybe you are dealing with some anxiety that is holding you back from getting out there in life to find what will energize you.To up the excitement level in your life, then, you need to find an activity and people who do it. You can do that without risking your life or your health. You can do it without resorting to fantasy. As you rightly pointed out, self-harm and making up stories aren’t really satisfying methods. Cutting hurts. Internal stories are just that — internal. You need a project that grabs your attention and that makes you feel like you’ve done something significant.For some kids, performing in some way does the trick. For others, pulling off a big art or science project is just what they needed. For still others, getting involved in a project or cause with people they admire is the antidote to life that is too ordinary.I suggest you sit down in a quiet place and ask yourself what you would be doing if you weren’t anxious. Just let the ideas come. You will probably get at least a hint about a direction you can take. Then start taking some small risks. You could take on some backstage work if you don’t feel ready to perform. You could assist others in a project you believe in if you’re not ready to be a leader. You’ll get to know new people and you’ll develop new skills. Most important, you’ll be able to point to whatever it is and proudly say to yourself, “I helped do that!”The world needs passionate people who are passionate about making change, seeking new discoveries and making new art. I hope you find an area that makes your heart sing and that lets you make a difference.I wish you well.  </s>"

It’s imperative that you ask for help even if you believe that your parents can’t relate. They need to know what’s wrong. You need to tell them about your symptoms.If they won’t listen, then tell someone else you trust or who you think can help. That might be an adult relative, a friend’s parents, a trusted faculty member, or a school counselor. Tell whoever you think can help you. School officials should be aware of your dyslexia.Do your best to avoid hurting yourself. It only makes things worse. I understand you’re frustrated, but you must find a healthy alternative for your strong emotions.The following ideas are not replacements for mental health treatment but may help in the meantime. Try exercising. Many people find exercise helpful for reducing strong emotions. You might also try breathing exercises or meditation, playing a musical instrument, watching a funny movie, walking in nature, drawing, calling a friend, volunteering, or spending time with a pet.Our behavior influences how we feel. The aforementioned ideas do not cure mental illness, but they can have a calming effect which can temporarily make you feel better. They can prevent you from engaging in self-harm and reduce your stress levels. If you harm yourself, then you will feel worse. Make an effort to never harm yourself again and to try other ways of reducing stress.What’s most important and imperative is that you ask for help. I know it can be difficult, but you must not keep this problem to yourself. I urge you to ask for help and to do so immediately. Please take care. </s>"

Change him and go about your business.Meanwhile – and this is important – give him lots of attention for other things where he is demonstrating competence. Has he started helping you around the house? A 5-year-old can learn to set and clear the table, make his bed and help put away laundry. He can help with the gardens or with shoveling the walk or cleaning snow off the car. Give him lots of praise for being quite the little man. Also — get him excited about going off to school. Talk about all the neat things that will happen there and all the friends he’ll meet.If he’s still soiling as you get close to school opening day, call the teacher and enlist some help. Bring him in to meet the teacher and see the classroom a few days before school starts. Pack his diapers in his backpack (again – no discussion, scolding or sighing allowed). During that visit, have the teacher “discover” the diapers and then say to him very, very sadly, “Oh. I’m sorry. Kids who come here don’t wear diapers. I guess you can’t come. That’s too bad. I was so looking forward to having you in my class. Maybe you can come next year.” Don’t talk about it. Just quietly pack up, shake the teacher’s hand and tell her you’ll let her know if he changes his mind.Your attitude through all this is the most important factor. You really need to be able to at least act like you don’t care a bit one way or the other. You are dropping your end of the fight. When the adult stops fighting, the kid usually gives up the behavior. Everything else you’ve done hasn’t worked so it’s at least worth a try.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m 15 and struggle with depression; its become an issue thats affecting my performance in school& ability to function properly. My parents are divorced but I have no choice but for there to be more of my mom’s time & she has more control over my life in general. a few months ago i tried to talk to her about the fact that im depressed and most likely need medical attention, she dismissed it as me just being a lazy hormonal teenager who feels sorry for myself. i said i needed therapy and she said i need to solve my own problems and not rely on a therapist. even if its not a case of mental illness i have no way of knowing this because i cannot get help. its taken a horrible toll on my grades and the only thing keeping me from considering the possibility of suicide is that i have friends who need me. i feel like i cant go on much longer and i have no way of finding out if i need medical attention let alone getting any. my dad would be more understanding but he doesnt have much control and i really feel like i cannot go on much longer without therapy or medication which i cant get. please help. [/INST]  I am sorry that this is happening to you. I get letters from teenagers who are in similar predicaments. They ask their parents for help but are disappointed when they don’t get what they need. There are other things to try. Suicide is never the answer because once you are dead, you will not be around to enjoy the good things that will occur, when your life turns around, and it will turn around. Psychological studies show that to be true. Survivors of suicide attempts, are in general, glad that they failed at suicide. Again, psychological studies, case histories, show this to be true.You can do several things. Speak to the school counselor or another trusted faculty member. Tell them what’s going on. They can also speak to your parents about the importance of mental health treatment. Even if your parents are not willing to listen, the school counselor can provide direct and immediate assistance to you. They are trained professionals and know how to help.Another idea is to show this letter to your parents. It might help them to understand how you are feeling. It might underscore your desire for wanting help and force them to take your concerns seriously.Are there other adults in your life who can help? Is there an uncle or a parent of a friend with whom you can speak about these issues? If so, they might have better luck in convincing your parents to take you to treatment. Mental health treatment is what you need at this time.Sometimes, parents forget how difficult it can be to be a teenager. They might think (or hope) it’s “just a phase.” Perhaps they don’t know how to acquire mental health treatment for you or fear they cannot afford it. In any event, the ideas above might be enough to convince them of the seriousness of your suffering.In the meantime, if you feel that you might harm yourself, call 911 or go to the emergency room. They will help you to access mental health treatment and prevent you from harming yourself. They will ensure your safety. Good luck and please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My girlfriend is the nicest person ever. She always does whatever she can for her family even if it’s at the cost of her own individuality or time. She’s very family oriented which makes it hard for her to tell her family about me. I work for her family and they always liked me UNTIL her sister found out we were dating. Ever since then her family has just disliked me because they feel I’m not good enough for her or will ruin her life. This is hurting us both. I know that she’s not ashamed to be with me or anything like that because everyone else knows that we’re together, its just that she doesn’t want to go against her parents and she’s scared because she’s really close with them. She has assured me that i’m the person she wants to be with. We’re just stuck and don’t know what to do. We’ve been together for a year now. I know that she will eventually have to tell her family but the question is how? How do we approach this, how does SHE approach it. It’s really unfair because we’re the happiest when we’re together with no outside influences, but once her family starts tearing me down to her it really hurts us and her mainly. We are asian i feel like traditional asian families don’t communicate feelings and emotions well. We’re just supposed to do as we’re told and be happy about it. I know nothing is going to get better if we keep going on without admitting to them that we’re together but we’re just kind of “waiting for the right time”. Worst part is her sister was a rebel and got to make her own choices, but now she’s the one coming down on her the hardest. It’s like she completely forgot what it means to have free choice. So can you give any advice on how we could bring this up to her parents or what does she have to do for them to stop treating her like a child and give her, her own freedom and choices. [/INST]  This is a classic dilemma, which deserves a classic response. You state your age is 26 so as a young adult it may be time for you to grab the bull by the horns. This is not a teenage romance, but rather you and your girlfriend’s adult life. I think it would be important to talk with your girlfriend about how to approach this, but the bottom line is either you alone — or you and your girlfriend — need to have a meeting with her parents. Tell them how you feel. Explain that you’re caring for their daughter is genuine and that it is a joint decision. Explain that you would like to move forward with less friction but, whether or not they cooperate, your love for her isn’t going to change.In other words put the ball in their court — yet make it clear that your love for each other is not going to depend on their blessing.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Spain: I am gay man who is 28. Before I came out as gay, I was meeting people via a dating app secretly. And one day I started doing something disgusting which I fully regret now. I came from a good family who have always loved me and supported me, but what I did would definitely shock them. One day a man wanted to meet me, however he was 70 and I was 22! I said no, but he finally offered me a lot of money and I agreed to meet. We did meet for at least 3 months for several times and even though we never had proper sex, I did let him do things to me. [/INST] I am so very glad you wrote. It’s been over 5 years — long past time for you to forgive yourself and move on.I don’t think there is a person in the world who at one time or another did or didn’t do something they regret. Making mistakes is part of how we learn who we are and what we stand for. We often remember such things in order to remind ourselves to not go in that direction again.In your case, the “reminder” has become a daily poison. It’s as if you don’t quite trust yourself to be the man you want to be. Please take a good look at how you’ve been living these past five years. My guess is that you have reason to feel good about yourself. You left behind a behavior that you didn’t like then and don’t approve of now. That’s something to be very proud of.I hope you can be proud of the man you’ve become. I doubt very much that you need to keep beating yourself with regret in order to be that guy. If you find that you can’t keep it in perspective, then please fine a counselor who can help you with it.I wish you well. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Thank you in advance for your assistance. I have a very detailed long-term memory that stretches back to my first year of infancy. I can recall exact details from conversions, of my surroundings (from scents to background sounds). I can remember most of the very vivid dreams I had in my childhood, most being nightmares. Most of the dreams were recurring. One in particular strikes me as having deep meaning. In these dreams, I used to call them “the big bad wolf” dreams (as this was all a child could relate it to) – this large black humanoid wolf would always be trying to take me from my parents/other family. He would be nice around them (they seemed to know him = indicative of maybe a close friend or family member perhaps?) and they let him take me away. Normally to the basement of my house/my bedroom closet/or my grandma’s basement. Once alone with him, he’d try to attack me or keep me hostage. I was terrified of him. He wore clothing too, like a person. I just wonder if this sounds like I have repressed memories of sexual abuse or something of the like? [/INST]  It is difficult to interpret dreams without having many details about the individual dreamer. There are very few generalized statements that can be made about dreams, which is why dream books are unreliable. One universal symbol in dreams is water. Water refers to the unconscious mind but that universal symbol may be overridden by a personal symbol. That is why one cannot interpret a dream without knowing the details of the dreamer’s life. Water may mean peace and security and not be a symbol of the unconscious mind. It depends on the individual.You asked about whether this dream could indicate sexual abuse. That is a difficult question to answer. The fact that these dreams are vivid, memorable, emotional and reoccurring is significant and notable. Reoccurring dreams are essentially attempting to send us a message that we have yet to grasp. Dreaming of the basement and a humanoid wolf may signify sexual abuse but not necessarily.The fact is that without a professional, skilled in dream interpretation, you may never know what the dream means. What can be said with certainty is that the dream is significant because of its vividness, repetitiveness and its emotionality. I would recommend that you keep track of this type of dream, being certain to record each detail, especially the way you feel during the dream. More details may be revealed in future dreams. It’s best to record the details of dreams as soon as you awake. You may also want to consider consulting a therapist who specializes in dream interpretation for further assistance. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  I am always feeling like I am making wrong decisions. I suffer frequent headaches and when I do, I feel like I have done something that has angered or upset God. I am taking prescription meds for the headache, depression, and anxiety, but it doesn’t always work. I believe that God heals, so why won’t He heal me? I feel like the reason He won’t heal me is because He is mad or upset with me for something I did or did not do. I am constantly in fear because I don’t know what I’ve done wrong. I speak with my pastor and other Christians who all say God isn’t mad at me. But if He isn’t mad, why am I continuing to suffer? I want to do His will in my life but I don’t know what it is, and feel that may be the reason for my punishment. In the biblical sence, I am supposed to put others first before myself. But my doctors, therapists, and family all tell me that I need to come first before I can help others. How can I care for my own health as well as other people’s needs as a Christian should? I am actually having anxiety as I write this because I am afraid that God will be mad at me or upset with me if I send it,possibly because I am under the impression that Christians are supposed to be happy all of the time, and not sick or stressed. How can I be a good witness for God if I am anxious, and panicky all of the time? Please help! I need peace! [/INST]  You dear person. You are trying so hard to be good that you are making yourself feel very bad. I’m not a pastor, but I do know this. You are treating god as though he is human – and not a very nice human at that. The god of Christianity is not a vengeful god who makes people miserable because he is mad at them. The father of Jesus is a god who forgives and loves and tries to help people also be forgiving and loving. I sincerely doubt that your physical suffering has anything to do with your spiritual relationship with god. Embrace the comfort that a relationship with a loving god can give you. Turn to your physicians and mental health professionals to help you in the physical world.You say that your medications aren’t working. The best treatment for what you are describing is a combination of medication and talk therapy. Make sure that your therapist and your prescriber are in regular contact. Your therapist can give your prescriber information he or she needs to adjust your medications. Do spend at least part of your therapy time working on refining your coping skills so you have more tools for taming your anxiety. Please also stay in touch with your pastor and allow yourself the comfort of prayer.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello everybody, I’m a 25 year old female from Greece. I suffer from borderline personality disorder, cannabis abuse disorder, Aspergers syndrome and ADHD (some psychiatrists believe I also have bipolar disorder). When I was a teenager I also had eating disorders. [/INST] What a complicated collection of diagnoses. I can’t tell you whether or not you have bipolar disorder. I can tell you that smoking marijuana every day is not helpful to any of your problems and may be making things worse. Especially since you are taking medication, it is essential that you talk to your prescriber about it to determine if the weed is interacting in any negative way with your medicine.Besides the drug use, I think the borderline personality disorder (BPD) diagnosis impacts everything else — even your concerns about who to trust. For that reason, if you were seeing me, I’d be working on the borderline diagnosis first. The most researched treatment for BPD is Dialectical Behavior Therapy. I encourage you to research it and to look for a therapist in your area who has expertise in that technique. It will provide you with practical tools for managing and regulating the emotional responses that often cause you to hurt yourself or to be confused about who to trust in relationships.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] The problem in a nutshell is that I have no close friends and when I’m single (which is the case right now) I’m completely lonely and more depressed than ever. In social situations where I don’t know anybody I fit the definition of a wallflower to a T. I’ve been so desperate to make friends that I’ve pushed myself to go to parties or events but when I get there I’m so awkward and introverted that I’m nearly brought to tears and usually leave early. Once I even traveled 40 minutes to a social event I found online just to see all the people there and turn around without even going inside. [/INST]  I’m so sorry that you’ve had this longstanding problem and haven’t found the help you need. Zoloft may help take the edge off but it isn’t going to help you find the friends you long for. At this point, you may be feeling so defeated in this area of life that you radiate pessimism even when you do approach people.I strongly suggest you get involved in some group therapy. In group, you will get feedback about what you do and don’t do that gets in your way. You will have the opportunity to interact with people in a safe place where everyone is working on their issues. With the guidance of the therapist, you will not only learn some new skills, but you will have the opportunity to rehearse them with group members before you take them out into the world. This will give you some new and much-needed self-confidence.Google search either “social therapy, NYC” or “Group therapy, NYC” and you will find quite a long list of resources.You made an important first step in writing. I hope you will take the next step and get some practical and emotional help. It’s completely understandable that you are discouraged. But you are only in your 20s. If you take care of this issue now, you will have many, many years of having more of what you want in life.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am 20 year old male and i have a 12 year old cousin and we used to be really close, more like friends but things changed. I had some serious medical illness and our families have some problem with each other (so we are not talking). Me and my cousin were like best buddies, he used to hang around me, take me to places, just two of us all time when i went to his house but he never contacted me after that even when i had accident. I remember him so much and i wonder how can he forget me? No call nothing and i guess 12 year old is mature enough. Sometimes i feel all the fun and time just two of us spent together was fake, he was never my friend. I had even seen him in dream, two of us hanging around. Really sad. Please help. thanks [/INST]  I’m sorry you’ve been through a hard time and that you miss your cousin. But your reaction is troubling. You talk as if this kid is older or the same age as you, not substantially younger. With an eight year age difference, it’s unrealistic and probably inappropriate for you to be longing for contact like this. What did you mean, “take you to places”? That’s a reversal of roles. If anyone is doing the “taking to places,” it would normally be an older relative indulging a youngster. It would make sense to me if you missed contact with his whole family but that’s not what I’m sensing in your letter.I have a guess that making friends is hard for you. Rather than finding people your own age and stage to hang with, you are seeking companionship and good times with a child. If that’s the case, you need to be working on finding people at your college to spend time with. If you are shy, a great way to begin to get to know people is by joining in some kind of charity or project or club. When the focus in on the project more than on each other. It allows a slow and non-threatening way to begin to relate.Even if your families reconcile, I hope you will take some distance from your cousin until you can establish a more appropriate role with him. You should think of him as a cute kid, not as a peer.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My problem is that when I find a girl with any of the same interests as myself and start talking to them I immediately get attached and feel almost in love with the person both emotionally and sexually. This has happened many many times and can be kick started from one simple conversation. It is very troubling meeting someone once or twice and having the feeling of deep personal heartbreak when I cannot engage in a romantic relationship with the person. I have had a few relationships off of this feeling but have to repress it constantly during the first few months. Just ending a two-year relationship I had forgotten about the issue until recent months when it returned and continues to happen. The slightest hint of interest from a nice girl makes me want to do anything and everything for them and I have constant thought of them. I say I have a feeling of heartbreak because getting dumped from a two-year relationship didn’t feel nearly as bad as every miniature heartbreak I have over every potential match. My parents are divorced but have been there for my whole life with little fighting in the divorce. I have had an average amount of romantic relationships for my age and in no way feel outcast, bullied, ignored, etc. I would describe my life as fairly normal, which is why I’m having such a hard time understanding why I have such an instant and deep attachment issue. Any help would be appreciated. [/INST]  When we have been hurt there is also hope. My guess is that the pain you felt from the breakup is fueling hope for a new relationship. This is natural, and the fact that you feel this pull to be with someone is natural. Yet I can hear how difficult of a situation it has created.One way to begin dealing with this is to practice brief conversations with women that are designed for you to have a beginning, middle and end. In other words, initiate a conversation with a woman while you are online for coffee or groceries and practice your endings: “It was nice talking to you;” “Enjoy the rest of your day;” etc.When you learn to ski, the first thing they teach you is how to slow down and stop. When you learn to ride a bike they teach you how to brake. You need to practice brief encounters so that every one doesn’t get you too involved.Wishing you patience and peace, </s>"
"<s>[INST] Almost constantly; while I’m driving I think about getting into a crash, while I’m sitting at home I think about being robbed or killing myself. Anything, really. I want these things to happen and sometimes I gain the motivation to do something about it myself but I never really have the means or the motivation (for lack of a better word) wears off. To me, it doesn’t matter whether the fantasy ends with my dying or not, and whether it is preferred or not really varies. Recently I had a friend kill himself, and obviously it got to me; but this all started way before he hung himself. While I am devastated about his loss, I also feel an odd sense of guilt and envy because he actually did what I’ve always wanted to/thought about doing. [/INST] What you seem to be describing is passive suicidal ideation. The passive element essentially means that you may want to die but are not actively attempting to end your life. Put another way, you may desire death but are not actively engaging in suicidal behavior.In studies about suicidal behavior, passive suicidal ideation was found to be a risk factor for severe suicidal actions. Clearly, suicide is on your mind. You mentioned it in your letter and even stated that it’s something you’ve always wanted to do. By your own admission, you are envious of someone who completed the act.This is not a matter to take lightly. The desire to die is serious. It is not a natural state of being. It suggests a high level of unhappiness and dissatisfaction with your life. It means that something needs to change, an adjustment is necessary. It’s a red flag that should not be ignored.According to the National Institute of Mental Health, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. In 2017, nearly 47,000 people in the United States ended their own lives. Often people consider suicide when they are unhappy or don’t know how to make positive changes in their lives. Suicidal people often develop a tunnel vision that focuses exclusively on negativity. This is why consulting a mental health professional is essential, to assist you in seeing the objective reality. There are a broad range of options available to you to remedy this problem.I would encourage you to read about people who have attempted suicide and who have survived. Consider the story of Kevin Hines. Mr. Hines attempted suicide by jumping from the Golden Gate Bridge. He was in a miserable state of mind. He believed that his life couldn’t change. He thought suicide was his only option. He writes about having regretted his decision to jump the moment his fingertips left the rails of the bridge. He instantaneously knew that he had made a mistake. Fortunately, he lived to tell that story and now imparts his wisdom to others. He lived to see that life can change for the better, with treatment. His story is hopeful, uplifting and demonstrates the will to live that exists in all of us.There are many others like him, too. You can learn about some of their stories by reading this article in The New York Times titled The Urge to End It All.I would also recommend this story about Marsha Linehan, an expert in mental illness who also struggled with suicidal ideation. Reading about their “lived experiences” can help to change your view on life.By reading the aforementioned stories, you’ll hopefully understand that people who are suicidal really don’t want to die. They wanted their pain to end and falsely believed that suicide was a way out. It is not. Getting help is the answer. Whatever might be wrong, is correctable with treatment.Studies indicate that there are millions of people suffering who have never sought professional help. Essentially, that means there are millions of people who are suffering with treatable problems. There’s no reason to suffer with treatable problems when help is available.Contact your primary care physician or mental health professional and ask for their assistance. They will know how to help you. Call emergency services if you cannot protect yourself or believe that you might harm yourself. Good luck and please take care. </s>"

It could explain your dramatic personality changes and negative feelings towards others.It’s imperative that you seek help. People don’t naturally want to hurt other people.

"<s>[INST] I am extremely observant of people as I had high intellect but a very low understanding of people’s motivators. I ended up being able to charm just about anyone, being able to understand people’s states and inner beliefs almost at a glance, and feeling terribly weary and disillusioned for it. I often find myself exasperated “are you really that dumb?” “Where’s your ability to judge your own situation?” “So slow. People’s internal actions and reactions are so dull, slow, foolish, and I cannot say anything because they won’t be able to understand my words, and I know exactly why. It seems to me that people are often walking happily to their own emotional and personal demise and they will not listen to me, they are convinced that how they ‘feel they are entitled to act’ is the ultimate truth. I often feel like I am surrounded by sleepwalkers. The worst feeling in life is to be able to manipulate someone so easily and see them react exactly as you expected they would, as though they are machines devoid of sense and independent thought. It is the worst feeling because those little tricks I play out of boredom prove again and again that I am right. Who the hell wants to be right about something like this!!!?? I am right about enough already, ever since kindergarten!! I don’t need to be right about despair!!! I am extremely intellectual but I would still enjoy ‘human contact’ right? Although since humans are what I understand them to be, I may as well be an alien. *Laughs bleakly* (From New Zealand) [/INST] I think you have some decisions to make about how you want to be in the world. You describe yourself as “extremely intellectual” yet feel contempt for others who may not be so endowed. You describe yourself as observant, and yet only seem to be observing ignorance and ineptitude. You see where others are stuck, and yet cannot find a way to help. Instead your sense of preeminence has you as a witness to other’s despair, but only seem able to manipulate others and identify them as “machines devoid of sense and independent thought.”If you do have this high degree of perception it is curious that it isn’t balanced. It is colored by a sense of superiority that diminishes rather than attempts to help others. Perhaps the work for you isn’t to notice how others won’t be able to understand you, but what you might need to do to learn how to help alleviate other’s suffering. What seems lacking is a sense of empathy, compassion, and kindness. Your high degree of perception has a blind spot.To counteract this (if you care to) I recommend learning more about who you are, your potential, and what character strengths you possess. Character strengths are those abilities that, when used in the right way, improve our well-being and help others.There are a total of 24 character strengths based on six virtues with over 8 million people having taken it. Look at this list of character strengths and virtues. You will see the six virtues followed by the character strengths associated with them.I’d begin by taking the viacharacter.org strength survey to learn more specifically about what you are good at—and then learn how to use and improve these strengths. This will allow you to use your keep perception of other’s needs and find ways to support rather than distance yourself from them. This will give you the “human contact” you are looking for.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"

The friendship started out as just a great platonic friendship. They’re both a little older than me so I would go to them with relationship struggles or just general life advisers and confidantes. [/INST]  When people get together as adults, they each are likely to have had past relationships. While young, people are likely to have tried experiences and to have taken risks they would not take as adults. Once past 30, there is also a strong possibility of having loved and lost and loved again.You can’t erase your past. Neither can he. While developing a new relationship, the important thing is not what we’ve done or who we’ve been with but what we have learned along the way to becoming our present self.The current situation is difficult for you both. You don’t want to live your life always feeling like he may judge you yet again for something that is past history. If he can’t accept that your experimental stage was just that — a stage — then he will always be wondering if he will lose you to another threesome. That’s not a good way to live either.It is unhealthy for you to feel that you have to withhold parts of yourself in order for your boyfriend to feel secure.

"<s>[INST] my dad passed away two months ago after being diagnosed with COPD 5 years ago. we were not very close but i still stayed with him every weekend until last year when i wasn’t able to go down as much due to work. when it happened i was given 2 days off work then i was back to normal 10 hour shifts so i haven’t had much time to grieve. everybody has been constantly telling me i am fine and to cheer up, but i don’t feel fine. all i ever want to do is cry, but i feel like i am doing something bad by crying because i never visited him as much as i should of, there for i have no right to be hurting now that he has gone. i have self-harmed a lot in the past and can feel myself slipping back into that state but i don’t want to be that person, i just don’t understand how i am suppose to just carry on as if this has not happened. [/INST]  Of course you want to cry. The possibility of your dad dying has been hanging over your family since you were only 14. Please give yourself more credit. You did your best to be with him as much as you could. Because he was sick, you probably spent a lot more time with your dad than most teens do. When you weren’t with him, you thought about him.The truth is that no matter how ready we think we may be, when we love someone, it’s a shock when they are gone. Here’s the truth: It generally takes three years or more for people to move beyond a big grief. That doesn’t mean you’ll be crying all the time for the next three or more years. It does mean that every once in awhile, the feeling of sadness will come over you. It’s often kind of mysterious what sets it off. It can be an anniversary event, seeing something that reminds you of him, or doing something you used to do together. Sometimes it’s as simple as eating a chocolate that the loved person liked. It’s important to understand that these moments of sadness that seem to come out of the blue are normal. It’s also important to know that grief takes as long as it takes for each of us. We all grieve differently and on our own timelines.Please ignore your well-meaning friends or co-workers. They don’t get it. Until they also experience a truly meaningful death, they aren’t likely to. Give yourself permission to cry now and then. And please remember that your dad wouldn’t want you to self-harm as a way to honor his memory. If you think about it, I’m sure you can think of something else you can do that would make him feel well-remembered and loved.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: All of this happened in the past ten months: My mother was diagnosed with Alzheimers and cancer.. . my mom and stepfather were forced into assisted living. at my moms’ I found evidence I possibly had a different birth father, my mom had an affair with a married man when I was little. My mother said he was NOT my father. He recently died. [/INST]  (We don’t usually edit letters but for your privacy, I have done so.) What a terrible pile up of tragedies and problems! It is no wonder you are suffering. It is no wonder that you are at times swamped with emotions. You do need support and help — far more than I can offer in an advice column.All I can do is affirm that you have every reason to be sad and angry and confused. I can also encourage you to go slow with the relationship with a married man who is wracked with guilt and who has a diagnosis of bi-polar. Not all harbors in a storm are ultimately safe. However much you two may care for each other and comfort each other, neither of you is in any shape to make a commitment to another person. You both have serious issues that deserve your attention. Left untreated, those issues will make any relationship extremely difficult over the long run.I strongly urge you to explore options for getting help.

"<s>[INST] I met my boyfriend nearly 2 years ago online. He is in the army and was soon to be sent to Afghanistan. He lived about 6 hours away from me but being that we just met I decided not to visit (for safety reasons). Once he was sent away, we became very close, we scheduled web cam dates, sent letters, emails, cards, etc. [/INST]  It’s really, really important to remember that you are the adult and she is the child. You are not competing with her for your boyfriend’s attention. You need adult attention. She needs the love and attention every child needs.I do not think this child is jealous. I think she is traumatized. She is only two and has lost her mother. Separating her from her mom may absolutely be the right thing to do but a little baby doesn’t have any way to understand that. All she knows is that her mother has gone away. It sounds to me like she is clinging to her daddy because, in her baby way, she doesn’t want to lose him too. You and your boyfriend need to talk to a therapist who can help you learn how to help this little girl feel more secure. If you two go forward in this relationship, you will need to do some serious work together for her to understand and learn to relax and to accept you into the family.In the meantime, go slow. You are not going to be able to turn this situation around during a visit so it’s better to not push for change. Start out by just being a friendly person in their lives. She needs time to learn that you are not a threat. You and your boyfriend need time to learn what it’s like when you are on the same couch, not on line. By all means, wait for your turn for your boyfriend’s affection when she is napping or in bed for the night.Please be patient with the situation. Going slow now will pay off in the future.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been dating my boyfriend for about a year and a half now and we have lived together for about 6 months. He does have a bad temper and sometimes throws things during fights and other things of that nature, but I just always thought he had a temper and that was just that. But, come to find out the more I talked to his brother and mostly his sister in law they have told me many things about his childhood (they are 10 years older than him). His father was never around, he does drugs and is an alcoholic and verbally/emotionally abused his mother and my boyfriend when he was very small, up until about age 7 and still to this day plays guilt trips on him about anything he can. But I have noticed my boyfriend is ALWAYS very angry and VERY short fused with his mother. When she calls he will get very agitated and annoyed just by talking to her for a minute and she stops by randomly without notice almost daily and he gets very angry at her for this but she won’t stop. [/INST] I would agree with you and your boyfriend that he needs to seek psychological help. He may not necessarily need to see a psychiatrist because they mostly prescribe medication. If he can address his past and control his anger, he may not need medication.I would suggest finding a good therapist in your area who deals with childhood abuse issues. It may be that his anger outbursts are part of unresolved issues with his parents due to their treatment toward him, but it may also be that he just never learned healthy ways of dealing with emotions. It doesn’t sound like either of his parents modeled appropriate anger expression so he may have some relearning to do now that he is an adult.However, this being said, I also need to tell you to be careful and look out for yourself as well. Just because we understand why someone may act the way they do doesn’t mean we should ever allow ourselves to be abused or disrespected. It is unacceptable for him to mistreat you because he hasn’t dealt with his issues. I know you love him and have empathy for his situation, but if he doesn’t get help and change his behavior, you may have a difficult decision to make. Please don’t subject yourself to abuse just because you know he is hurting inside. Help him get help but protect yourself in the process. Good luck. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My brother just started working at a company as an independent contractor and since then he has starting telling my parents and me that they (his co-workers) are all playing secret mind games with him. He’s telling us he’s met them before and describing in very elaborate details about those encounters that supposedly happened years ago while he was in college. He’s also convinced that one of his new co-workers is related to a former boss and when I did the research to prove to him it’s not true he could not accept this reality and then changed his story to make them relatives again, ex: “Well they must be cousins then.” He has also told me mom he thinks people are watching him. I tried talking to him last night to ask him if he would consider talking to a psychiatrist about these issues and he claims he’s fine. I’ve done as much research as possible on his wild stories to see if there is any truth in them and there simply is none but he is convinced that they did happen. I’m worried sick about him and I’m not sure how to proceed with getting him the help he clearly needs. [/INST]  I believe your concerns are valid. Your brother believes in things that aren’t true despite evidence to the contrary. That is the definition of a delusion. He also seems to be paranoid. Delusions and paranoia are symptoms of psychosis. Though he is exhibiting symptoms of psychosis, I cannot determine with certainty whether or not he is psychotic. Only an in-person, mental health evaluation could properly make that determination. Nevertheless, his symptoms are concerning.Continue to encourage your brother to seek help. You should also discuss your concerns with your family and perhaps you, as a group, could convince him to seek help. If there are friends of his that you can include, this might help as well. Do everything within your power to convince him to seek professional help.It’s important to realize the limits of your power in this situation. Continue to try to convince him to seek help but recognize that he has the right to say no. Generally speaking, adults cannot be forced into treatment unless there is evidence that they are a danger to themselves or to others. That is the nature of the mental health laws in the United States.If you believe that he is a threat to himself or to others, then you should call the authorities. Another option is to call the local mental health crisis team who will come to the home, assess your brother’s condition and determine if he needs to be hospitalized. If they believe that he needs to be hospitalized, they will take the necessary steps to commit him.In the meantime, try to do all that you can to convince your brother to consult a mental health professional. That may include you finding a healthcare provider for him or going to the appointment with him, if he would allow. He may be open to those things. Another option to consider is family therapy. He may be open to that form of treatment because all members of the family could attend the sessions, not just him alone. Your family may have other ideas as well.I hope this answer assists you in knowing how to proceed with your brother. I wish I had a better answer for you with regard to how to best help your brother. The reality is that people have the right to refuse treatment in this country even if they are clearly mentally unstable. Until this changes, your power is limited. If you have additional questions, please don’t hesitate to write again. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  My older brother who is 20 has taken control of my family. I haven’t talked to him since I was 7, but he still lives with us. My parents and I must do anything he says, get out of the same room he is in, and not talk to him or he will go insane. He is large and throws tantrums frequently. He’s punched holes in the wall, thrown things around, and has caused significant damage to our home. My parents still give him whatever he wants, even though he’ll spit in their face if he doesn’t like it. He’s hit me and my mom, and has attempted my dad. My dog runs off every time he comes downstairs, which reassures me that he is dangerous, if she can sense it. [/INST]  I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of a letter but your letter certainly sets off my inner alarms. Your whole family is under siege. You haven’t talked to him for 11 years even though you live in the same house? Things must be really bad!Your brother sounds very troubled. I understand completely that, besides being afraid of him, your parents want to protect him and help him if they can. But it doesn’t help him to be allowed to continue to tyrannize the family. He isn’t getting treatment he probably needs and he isn’t learning how to be socially acceptable.I urge you to investigate whether there is a domestic violence program in your city. Although most of the people who come to them are victims of spousal abuse, most such programs are also familiar with other variations of family violence. Counselors there will be able to give you valuable information about how to handle your brother and what resources are available to the whole family. They can also offer you and your parents important emotional support as you start trying to manage the situation differently.No one should live under the constant threat of violence. I hope you will share your letter and this response with your parents. I very much hope they will seek out the practical advice and support your whole family desperately needs.I wish you well.  </s>"

[/INST]  I’m so sorry you are having such a miserable time. I’m glad you wrote.All the medicine in the world is not going to help you out of what is a toxic situation. No one in your family appears to know how to handle emotions and conflict constructively. They get upset and yell instead of solving problems. And there are a lot of problems to solve. Being diagnosed with bipolar doesn’t excuse people from treating each other with compassion and doing what needs to be done to have a healthy family.I think you do need to see someone to help you figure out where you may have more power to change things than you think you do. A resource for free services for women is often found in programs for domestic violence. Although you don’t describe a situation where you are battered physically, you are certainly being emotionally abused. I suggest you see what the program near you has to offer in terms of counseling services. The closest program to you is in Wilkes-Barre. The phone number is 866-206-9050. Why don’t you give them a call and see if they can offer you free help or if they can refer you to another appropriate service?I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Sweden: I have seen my current T for one year during which we have managed to build a good, trustworthy relationship. My road to therapy has been very traumatizing, complex and very painful. My T started his summer vacation 3 days ago, when I last met him. We had 3 sessions per week, which for me is the absolute min. and not always sufficient. [/INST]  I am so, so sorry that life has been so hard for you. I’m also very concerned that only one person in the world has proven to be helpful. That exclusivity isn’t fair to you or to your therapist. It puts extraordinary pressure on you both.I wonder if you have tried to reach out to people in similar circumstances. Please take a look at the forums here at PsychCentral. People from all over the world who have similar problems provide support and practical help for each other. Go to the “Find Help” tab. Click on “Forums and Support Groups”. Identify the group that you think may be most helpful. (You may have to try more than one.) Often people who are going through much the same kind of distress can offer compassionate support and good advice. You can log on as much as you want and need to.Becoming part of a supportive community may provide the bridge you need until your therapist gets back. In fact, that community may also provide additional support even while you are in treatment.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] For the past 7 months or so, I have been feeling very irritable and upset. I notice I tend to takes things negatively almost immediately and realize I probably shouldn’t. Work is stressing me out when it never used to and I have trouble staying focused and concentrating. I am supposed to be close to graduation, but I am nervous about actually being ready. I feel like my friends are hurting me and then I hurt them back but don’t really mean to. My friends then ignore me and it makes me feel even worse and resentful. I feel like I only have one friend who really talks to me anymore. She thinks I should see a therapist, but it really scares me and makes me uncomfortable to be honest. My friend has offered to come with me the first time if I go. Do you think I should go and would her coming with be a good idea?(I realize I already submitted something, I sent it ahead of when I finished by accident). [/INST]  You have noticed a change in your mood and this is likely contributing to how you’re treating your friends. It may be a case of displacement. Displacement is a psychological defense mechanism where you take out your frustrations or anger on people who have little or no connection to what is causing your unhappiness. Essentially, displacement is misdirected anger.You may be worried about your future and thus have become hypersensitive to what others are saying about you or what you perceive others are saying about you.You stated that you “feel like” your friends are hurting you but it’s important to recognize that you could be wrong. Just because you feel like something is true does not mean that it is true. Your perception of these situations might be skewed. The fact that you have noticed a change in your mood increases the possibility that you’re wrong about the intentions of your friends. It’s important that this issue be resolved because it might be damaging your friendships.Your friend wisely suggested that you consult a therapist. You should do this. Counseling could provide an objective third-party perspective that may be necessary in this situation. Yes, you could bring her to your first appointment but it really isn’t necessary. Therapy is a positive experience. They are there to help you feel better. They will do the talking and ask the questions. It’s not like a test in school. You don’t need to study or to get ready. Just go in and talk. If you are nervous at first, they will make it very easy and pleasant for you.The purpose of counseling is to help clients improve the quality of their lives. I would encourage you to consider it and hope that you will. Please take care. </s>"

"<s>[INST] Is this “normal” or do I have a dysfunction? Sometimes, over nothing, after working myself up into almost unnoticeable stress — even to me — I lose it. I start screaming at the top of my lungs, tearing things apart, not quite smashing things and destroying everything, but I lose care and caution around things that I love like my drawings or my books and that usually ends up with them getting damaged in some ways. I have OCD and I think quite a high anger level but I rarely ever act on it, unless its once in a blue moon — like now. Otherwise, I am able to be very rational and breathe and calm down or do something else to preoccupy my mind. Usually outbursts of sadness or madness are about getting frustrated with my compulsion, but its never quite on scale to what I would call a mental breakdown (where I throw shit and scream and berate myself). I never do this in front of people, Im otherwise a very controlled person who can rationalize my way through my anger but Im wondering if I have maybe a personality disorder since these blue moon attacks can last for a long time until I break myself down into tears and hating myself and hitting myself (Ive spoken to a psychologist on and off for a few years and he said I might also be on the spectrum, idk) [/INST]  These attacks might seem “blue moon” to you, but they are probably not. If you track your thoughts and behavior prior to these attacks, you would probably see a pattern. There’s typically a reason for outbursts of “sadness or madness.”The key to understanding this problem might lie in what you referred to as your compulsion. You mentioned having obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD ) so I am assuming that your compulsion is because of your OCD. If I were your therapist I would want to know more about your compulsion. What is it? How long have you had it? What about it makes you so upset?You asked the question is this “normal” or do you have a “dysfunction?” Normal is a term that is difficult to define because it means different things to different people, but generally it’s not “normal” to experience extreme anger or sadness unless an event or a set of circumstances arises that invokes or warrants such extreme emotions. For example, if your beloved pet passed away it would be “normal” to feel very sad. Extreme sadness under those circumstances would make sense.OCD is an anxiety disorder. Compulsions are a symptom of the disorder. Think of them as maladaptive attempts at managing high anxiety. Counseling can teach you strategies for properly managing high anxiety and ways to reduce and ultimately eliminate compulsions. OCD and most other anxiety disorders are highly treatable with therapy and medication. If you haven’t tried them, you should strongly consider it. Please take care. </s>"

[/INST] I don’t know if you have inherited narcissistic qualities. But I have to ask “So what if you did?” I’m not particularly interested in labels. I’m interested in what people do with what genetics, environment, and experience has given them. You have many gifts: You are passionate about things. You are not afraid to see things that need improvement and you have many ideas about what to do about them. You have the intelligence to be a top student. You are able to be convincing with other people.It’s not what traits you inherit that matters, it’s what you decide to do with them. There are politicians who use such traits to enrich themselves and manipulate other people to help them do so. There are people with the same skills who serve those who elected them and who facilitate groups of people to right wrongs and to make the world a better place. It’s up to each of us to decide how we will best use our talents and traits. No one else can decide that for us.You can decide to feed your ego by ignoring your own faults. You can deal with your insecurities (and, yes, you do have them) by telling yourself that you are superior. But ultimately, you will find that posturing to yourself and others like that won’t work. You will always question whether you are in fact worthy of others’ high regard or if it’s all a sham.Genuine self-esteem comes from making a genuine contribution. Feeling good comes from doing good, nothing else. Take a long hard look at yourself and decide how you want to live your life.I wish you well.  </s>"

Now i’m in college and still having almost all the same problems. I’ve Always been the kid that thinks there listening but is tapping there pencil staring out the window or moving my feet around which makes people around you mad. It takes me forever to read something i even have to read the questions close before i tAke it in. Im a good reader it’s just like my mind doesn’t know what it just read. I don’t know how to explain it. I want to be a teacher so bad but Im still having problems at school now I’m on academic probation. I still am close to one of my teachers I had all threw high school and she still tells me she thinks I have that. Im very impulsive and always full of energy Ive even had a run in wihh the law. Does this sound consistent to ADD to you?? Im at my witts end and really wanna suceed And dont know what to do.. [/INST]  It must be terribly frustrating to know what you want to do academically but feel so helpless to do it. You know you are smart enough to do well in school but something keeps getting in your way. I’m not sure if the problem is ADHD. What you describe could be accounted for by any number of learning disabilities as well as by an impulse control disorder. You absolutely need to get an accurate diagnosis.Most colleges these days have a counseling service available for their students. You can get some testing there to help you understand just what the problem is. Your parents don’t have to know about it unless you want them to. Once you have been evaluated, you and the counselors will then have a solid basis for developing a plan to help you manage school. It’s also possible that you will need some accomodations to help you do your very best.There are lots and lots of smart kids who have learning differences that make it difficult for them to be successful in school. Being able to sit quietly for long periods of time, to change subjects at arbitrary times, to focus on several different subjects every day, to take timed tests, etc. may be the traditional demands of American schools but they are not necessarily reflective of someone’s intelligence or abilities. Let’s face it. You’ll never have to do things like that once you get out into the work world. Even teachers get to walk around and to change things up a little when they get restless.I hope you will take steps to learn more about your own learning style and how to use it. Then I also hope you will stick with your goal of becoming a teacher. Too often kids with undiagnosed learning differences decide they are stupid and develop terrible self-esteem. We need more educators who understand that being different doesn’t mean being deficient or dumb. It just means they need to work a little differently. Good minds like yours (and your future students) shouldn’t go to waste.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I am an only child and since I was born my parents have been extremely overprotective. This was a problem throughout high school, because I could never stay out late, sleep over my friends house, go to any parties not even a movie past 11:00pm. This made me an outsider at school. When I went off to college it was still a local school, but my parents allowed me to stay at the dorms. This was the best thing that could ever happen, though I did not go hog wild, I did experience things my parents would never allow me to do. This is also were I met my first serious bf that I dated for over 5 years. [/INST]  At 25, it’s well past time for you to renegotiate your relationship with your parents. I completely understand that they want what’s best for you, and they don’t want you or they themselves to be hurt by another break-up. What they don’t yet understand is that keeping you dependent is keeping you from coming into your own adulthood. What you don’t seem to understand is that you are cooperating with it.You’ve colluded in this more than you realize. You want your independence yet you let them furnish your apartment. They still pay your phone bill? Really? And somehow they have access to your bank account. You also apparently share information about your jobs with them and discussed your plan to jointly purchase a car. None of this is necessarily the business of the parents of an adult. If you want to be treated as an equal adult, you need to reassess where you are still acting like a dependent teen.It’s wonderful to have a close, caring relationship with parents, but for you to come into your own you need to take charge of your finances, your responsibilities and your choices. That includes your choice about who to love and how to live your life.I don’t know how serious your folks are about cutting you off if you don’t give in to their emotional blackmail. You need to decide if you are willing to take the chance. I suspect they don’t want to lose you any more than you want to lose them but people sometimes do hurt themselves and others just to prove some ridiculous point. I hope their love for you is strong enough to tolerate you becoming a grown up.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have always been an unhappy person. However, for about 3 years this feeling has become much more intense. I think of death and suicide almost every morning, with no concrete reason actually. [/INST]  Depression may be the problem. Several symptoms that may be indicative of depression include emotional instability, suicidal ideation and a marked increase in your unhappiness.You described yourself as a generally unhappy person. Some people describe themselves as a pessimist and others as an optimist but it is relatively rare for a teenager to experience such a long period of unhappiness. It may be a sign of chronic depression.You also described occasions in which you had difficulty with speech. Are these incidents related to nervousness? Did other people notice them? Have you been told that you “digress into irrelevant topics” or is it your characterization of the situation? The answers to those questions would help me to understand what’s wrong. People with depression often have a negatively skewed view of their skills and abilities. Depression increases the likelihood that you are incorrectly characterizing your speech problems.If you are in fact having speech problems, then you should be evaluated by a physician to rule out a medical cause. Problems with speech are sometimes indicative of neurological problems.My overall recommendation is to be evaluated by a mental health professional. You are clearly suffering and have been, for at least three years. Your unhappiness is intensifying and you’re often thinking about suicide. Those are all signs that help is needed and is long overdue. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] It all started with me intaking a syrop that contained THC, I was told that I would not experience any feelings of being high but it would help with my pain. ( I have pelvic floor dysfunction). As I took it, about two hours later I started to get a Panic attack , my heart would beat really fast and I thought I was going insane and dizzy. After that I had a feeling of derealization, not depersonalization that I did not feel like in my body, but that everything seemed weird strange, and in a fog almost dream like. I thought that this is what THC caused me to feel like (Never did it before). Next day I was fine but I found out my co-worker has passed away due to heroin overdose. Since then I had no symptomps of anything. Two months later, I started to get panic attacks and anxiety after my boyfriend’s fathers death. I had heart palapation, dizziness and lightheadeness. Once I found out that it was anxiety I learned to deal with it. However the derealization happened again once and made me feel like in a constant fog. Soon this went away as well but these intrusive thoughts won’t go away. Especially at night time where I think what if I am not really here, everything seems strange and weird around me. Not as much as that night that I took the syroup but sort of. IT’s just these thoughts are scaring me and make me think that I might be getting schizophrenia , or the onset of it…This is all I can think about, I try to go out and there are days where I have better days and seem happy and normal but then the worse days come too. I also thought I have schizophrenia because as I was falling asleep I would have a lot of chaotic thoughts in my head, not voices but random song lyrics popping up , scaring me to think I’m going crazy. Please I need some advice. [/INST]  I cannot provide a diagnosis over the Internet, but nothing in your letter would suggest schizophrenia. People who are prone to anxiety commonly think they are developing schizophrenia. In fact, it is one of the most common questions that I receive.You had a number of experiences that seem consistent with anxiety. It’s possible that you have anxiety and not schizophrenia. Consult a therapist, in-person, to determine what disorder, if any, you may have.These problems seem to have been triggered by your consumption of the THC-laced syrup. You may have had a negative reaction to it and its side effects may be still impacting you. When it comes to anxiety, it’s always best to be proactive. If you’re worried about your mental health, then it’s wise to consult a mental health professional. They can design a treatment plan to address your symptoms. I would highly recommend consulting a professional. It will help you to feel better.Treatments for anxiety disorders typically include counseling and medication, but not everyone needs both. Counseling will help you learn how to calm yourself when you’re feeling distressed. These skills are particularly important for people who are prone to anxiety. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have known this guy for seven years now, almost eight. I have a terrible tendency to like a guy that I just meet, which I then get over within a week. He and I didn’t talk much, but we had things in common, like what we watched or a few opinions on certain things. I had a dream about him, and we kissed twice. About a year later I started to realize that I liked him. Over the years we had gone months without talking, but I still found myself thinking of him. Over the summer we both found out that we liked each other, he liked me for four years. He started saying “I love you” a while later at the end of our calls and we talked more and hung out more. I even started having more dreams about him. One more where we kissed, just a 2second peck, but the rest were more of cuddling or just hanging out. I found out that his feelings faded about a month or two after we confessed. I feel like I have fallen for him more, though. Right now, we are still friends, but I still feel awkward when I talk to him. When I found out about his fading feelings for me, him feeling more platonic about me, I became depressed but at the same time, I’m slightly okay with this outcome and kind of glad that he doesn’t like me in that way anymore. I feel guilty for having an unexplained attraction to him, or even thinking about liking someone else. He has told me that his attraction to me was also unexplained. When I hear him or talk to him, I uncontrollably smile and sometimes blush. I feel nervous yet at the same time really comfortable around him. [/INST]  Sometimes we love people because they’re not available. I think this is likely to be the situation in this case. There are several things about unavailability that can allow us to feel feelings while remaining relatively safe. We can have all of the feelings without all of the actual bother of the relationship.Second, it is very common to be drawn to someone who is similar to a parent. Many of my clients who have unavailable partners have at least one distant parent. This is also something the relationship scientists study when they look at attachment. This might account for why somebody you see so sporadically could be eliciting such a strong attraction.Typically, once there is some genuine intimacy and closeness in these unavailable relationships, it can’t be tolerated. My best guess is that this is what happened with him. As soon as the feelings got too intimate, the relationship lost value for him.I would highly recommend a few brief individual sessions with a counselor to help you through this adjustment period, and to learn more about the strength of this attraction.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Dubai: Hello, I’m a girl from Middle East and I suffer a lot from everyone around me. I can’t even start with the main issue. But its related to my parents and family. They seem not to love and support me. They even don’t know my hobby and simple traits. [/INST]  It’s very, very sad but true that not everyone gets the parents they deserve. You are certainly not alone in this situation. I know that doesn’t really help but maybe knowing it will take the sting out a little. As painful as it is, your parents’ rejection of you and favoritism to others probably has nothing to do with you, really.I wrote an article for PsychCentral some time ago called Rejecting Childhood Rejection. Rather than repeat what I said then, here is the link: https://psychcentral.com/lib/rejecting-childhood-rejection/.Your challenge is to decide that your parents are simply wrong about you and to go about life in such a way that you can be successful and find other people who can and will love you for who you are. Your self-esteem won’t improve if you wait for your parents and relatives to give it to you. You need to start working on it on your own.Start focusing on school so that you can both feel good about yourself and gain the skills you need to get a job and live on your own. And do let your friends be the kind of friend to you that you would be to them. I know you would comfort a friend. Let your friends comfort you. Share some of what you are going through and ask for some reassurance and help. Friends often become closer than family. Give your friends a chance.The world is not your parents. There are many, many people out there in the world who, once they get to know you, will be the kind of “family” you deserve.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.:  Just before summer vacation my mom and I had gotten into a fight that lasted for hours. It was dumb and it was really just her yelling at me and me crying, aksing her to calm down. Eventually, it became to much and i ran into the bathroom and hurt myself, like I had been doing for months. [/INST] Thank you for writing. I think you already know that the one incident with your mom didn’t “shatter” your relationship with her. You already know that she isn’t completely stable. After all, she stayed in an argument with you for hours. She has a history of self-harm. She was so unable to cope with your problems that she absented herself. That doesn’t mean that she doesn’t love you. It only means that she has all she can do to manage herself. She can’t manage someone as close to her as her own daughter needing her help. The problems of others ultimately don’t affect her. Yours do.Adding to the issue in your case is that you’ve been “parentified”. Your family has come to expect you to be the strong one. It probably terrifies them on some level when you also have needs and then, maybe, can’t be there for them when they need it.As for your twin and your friends: Please don’t interpret their lack of response as lack of caring. Often people withdraw or joke when they just don’t know what to do or what to say. They worry they will say the wrong thing or make things worse. So they avoid the issues, change the subject, or drop out of sight.You do need support. You do need a place to express all of your feelings without fear of judgment or rejection. It would be great if such people could just appear now that you need it most but that’s unlikely. It will take time to make friends who see you as an equal, not the always strong one, and who can reciprocate your warmth and care. They are out there but you probably need to be in a better space to find them.So — I do think you should see a mental health counselor. You are anxious, depressed and lonely. That’s plenty of reason to seek out the ongoing support and practical help a counselor can provide. You need it. You deserve it. If you don’t know how to find a therapist, talk to your school counselor or your doctor.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My fiance and I were together for 7 years. We had the storybook romance: we were always happy, never argued, never tired of each other, and all of of friends and family looked at us as having the perfect relationship. Life could not be better for the two of us. [/INST]  How very, very painful this situation must be for you. One of my teachers used to say, “When things are easy, they’re easy. It’s when things are hard that you find out what you’re made of.” It seems that you two had a storybook romance as long as there were no big challenges. But life has a way of throwing obstacles in our paths. The shelter of school ended for her. You lost your mom. Work has been hard to find. Your home is disrupted. In short, there’s been stress layered on stress for some time. Apparently, when the going gets rough, your fiance gets going. She doesn’t know how to be a member of a team that confronts problems together. She sounds very young or very sheltered.If she’s willing, I would suggest you go back to the couples counselor. You had a positive experience before. Perhaps the counselor can help her understand that it takes more than love to make a relationship strong. It also takes the willingness to stand together when times are hard. If she isn’t interested, I’m sorry to say that there is nothing you can do to make her change her mind. In that case, I hope you will someday find someone who truly understands what being a partner means.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hey, I sometimes feel like there is a weight on my chest a heavy rock as if someone if pressing my chest I feel anxious and uneasy, sometimes I can’t even give a name to my feelings and I sit there wondering what do I have, I have some symptoms of OCD for example in a shop I so idk touch dresses and if I touch one with my left hand it has to be touched by my right hand as well in the same manner there are many more examples of such things but I have never had an anxiety attack. What is this? [/INST] You might be describing anxiety or panic attack. Essentially, they are the same thing. People very commonly describe experiencing a heavy weight on their chest, just as you have. The fact that you have some symptoms of OCD is further evidence that anxiety is a problem in your life.Anxiety might be the problem, but medical problems should first be ruled out. It would be advisable to consult a physician to examine whether medical problems could be causing the problem.In the meantime, consult a therapist who could investigate whether anxiety is to blame for the symptoms. Once you have a diagnosis, treatment can commence. Anxiety is commonly treated with psychotherapy and medication. You don’t have to do both. What you choose depends on what you’re comfortable with and the nature of your condition.The good news is that anxiety is a highly treatable condition. Your next step should be evaluation and then treatment. It’s ill-advised to avoid this problem and to hope it simply goes away on its own. Anxiety typically gets worse without treatment. Alternatively, treatment is highly effective for anxiety. You shouldn’t tolerate problems that are easily rectified. Hopefully this convinces you to seek treatment. Good luck with your efforts. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m in the first year in university, my story started when I finished high school with high grades but due to money problems I couldn’t attend medicine faculty and now I’m studying pharm.d. But since I started to study this all people keep asking me why I’m not studying medicine and they feel sorry about me, now I can change my major to dentistry and I’m thinking about attending it because anyway it’s higher than my current major, simply I can just throw off all the people’s talking about me if I do that, actually I’m more interested in practical studying offered in dentistry but I will lose a semester and I will be late, actually I don’t know what I want! PS: sorry for my language being bad because I’m not a native speaker [/INST]  Young adulthood and the huge decisions that come along with it can be overwhelming. You are not alone. Your struggle to find your academic and career path are shared by many I’ve seen in clinical practice.  There are so many factors to consider and so many people influencing major life decisions that it can be hard to find yourself in the process.I know it’s difficult, but try to remember that most of the people who are giving you input aren’t going to be in your life forever.  The most important person to please in your academic decision is you! You are the one who’s going to be doing the graduate work. You are the one who is going to be going to your job and finding fulfillment or regret, not them.Have you spoken with a counselor at the university to help guide you through this decision-making process? If you haven’t, I suggest that you do. An academic counselor can help you sort through which educational and career path will be the best fit for you and can help you identify possible financial resources that you may not have considered.I also recommend talking with professional pharmacists, dentists, and physicians and doing some job shadowing to get a feel for what they do. If you are really having a difficult time deciding, it’s all right to take time off from school to decide, or to switch majors if you find that what you’re doing doesn’t suit you. Yes, you will have lost some credits and it will take longer to graduate, but doing something that you enjoy will be worth it.Take good care of yourself!Julie Hanks LCSW </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: My wife and I are foster parents with the opportunity to adopt a child that has been in our care for a year. We have been asked to adopt her brother who suffered a traumatic brain injury at the age of 2 and was neglected much of his life. He is 7 years old now but has a history of aggression and has physically attacked both adults and children and there are incidents where he has shown cruelty towards animals. [/INST]  You are right to ask these questions. This child needs a home. You need to know what to expect. The medications he is taking indicate to me that he is a handful.An important question to ask is how someone determined he is bipolar. What went into the analysis? Are the medications being used to treat a mental illness or to control his behavior? If he is truly bipolar, he may be on the correct medications. But antipsychotic medications are often used because they are effective in calming someone down when aggressive. The distinction is important because any medication used long term is going to have an impact on his developing brain. As far as I know, prescribing Risperdal to a kid is an off-label use. You will want to ask about potential long term side effects.If the problem is primarily behavioral due to neglect, lack of socialization and lower than average intelligence, medication will calm him but won’t help him learn. Please, please don’t write off behavior therapy. It is often effective as a teaching tool with people who are as intellectually disabled as this little boy. He can learn. It will take time and patience but he can learn. I suggest you ask for a consultation with an ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis) certified specialist to talk this over.A powerful intervention for someone like this child is love. He has every reason to not trust people and to be defensive and offensive in his behavior. It will take lots of time and attention to win his trust so he can look to you for protection and comfort.In your state, the Department of Aging and Disability Services (DADS) oversees care of people like this boy. Before agreeing to adopt him, request a consultation with the mental health worker who is most familiar with his case. Make sure you are fully aware of services and financial support that are available.This little boy will require a lifetime of care. It is an enormous commitment to take him into your family and into your heart. Such relationships can be very, very rewarding. But it is certainly important that you go into it with your eyes open. Including him in the family will effect every member. Do think carefully about whether you and your partner have the emotional energy, time and resources that will be necessary for many, many years ahead.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My best friend had a terrible car accident 4 months ago with serious brain damage and head injuries, all the doctors said he would not make it, they said they are only waiting for him to die or stay in coma, and that there is nothing left to do. At that time i was absolutely devastated and had a really hard time. He was in a coma for about a month, however after a few successful surgeries he started waking up, and against all odds he survived. Injuries he suffered were great, but now, after 4 months, he is slowly recovering, he learned how to walk again, he recognizes his family and me, his long-term memory is more or less ok. However, his short-term memory is pretty bad, and because of the accident he cant open his eyes, and it is not sure whether he will be able to see again in his life. We are best friends from college, I live in Slovakia, he lives in Czech republic, so we were able to see each other only when in school, but we were always together, whether in school or when we were going out to bars etc. He is recovering in Czech republic, I am currently living in Slovakia, so I cannot see him that often. The problem is, i thought i got use to the fact that he is no longer going to school with me and that I am not seeing him regularly. However, he likes to talk on the phone (of course he is confused some times), and whenever his family calls me and I talk to them and to him, I start to shiver, shake, suddenly I am feeling cold and it takes my body about half an hour to relax. This is nothing serious, but I thought I am over the anxiety of him being hurt or dying, he is recovering and with each day he is getting better. But just a few days ago, when his family called me (after nearly a month or so), I immediately started to shake and experience these feelings again. I would like to know what to do, or how to get over this anxiety, i want to be helpful to my friend, and not feel this weak whenever I talk to him. Thank you [/INST]  Your anxiety associated with your injured friend does not make you weak. That line of thinking is problematic because it reinforces the all too common narrative that psychological distress is a sign of weakness, shame and embarrassment. To be shaken by the trauma of your friend makes you human and it shows that you care. Someone you deeply care about was severely injured in a serious accident. It was unexpected and proof that our lives can change in an instant. Psychologically, that realization can be difficult to manage.Your symptoms may be indicative of secondary trauma. Secondary trauma involves an indirect exposure to trauma through hearing the first-hand account or narrative of a traumatic event. Simply hearing about the traumatic event can cause symptoms and reactions that are very similar to or even mimic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Treatments for secondary trauma often involves sharing the story of what happened and talk therapy.It would be helpful to learn more about compassion fatigue, vicarious trauma and self-care. Books on the subject can educate you about day-to-day activities that may help to relieve your stress. I would also recommend counseling for learning relaxation and other techniques to assist with your anxious reactions. Choose a therapist who specializes in trauma survivors. You may only need a few sessions to decrease your symptoms. Good luck. Please take care. </s>"

[/INST]  No kid deserves this kind of treatment. I have no way of knowing if your mother is insane. Based on what you wrote, I do think she is abusive. Regardless of the reason, she had no right to hurt you physically in the past and has no right to humiliate you or shout at you now.It is no surprise that you are feeling depressed. You have been repeatedly traumatized by the person who is most supposed to love and care for you.You can’t help your mother. But you can help yourself. At 18, you are legally of age and can seek out treatment for yourself. Find a therapist who specializes in trauma. Ask your doctor for some names or talk to an adult you trust at school to find out where there are programs for teens who have been hurt.While you are looking for a therapist and beginning treatment, limit your time with your mother as much as you can. Get an after school job or join an activity that will keep you out of the house. Start thinking about ways you can leave home and be on your own. You are being regularly retraumatized as long as you live with your mom. This is only going to make you feel worse.You are also entitled to stand up for yourself. If you mother starts to shout at you or embarrass you, calmly inform her that you won’t listen to it and leave. Go to another room. Leave the house if necessary. Do not yell or shout or argue or behave like she does. That only keeps the negativity going. Just quietly leave. She may eventually understand that you won’t stay around for bad treatment.Another way to help yourself is to join one of the forums here at PsychCentral. People with similar issues support and encourage each other.I wish you well.  </s>"

"<s>[INST] I am a fit 27 year old male and have been experiencing accidents at night for two years now. At first it was rarely, after I consumed alcohol. In the past few months I find if I consume even 2-3 drinks (enough to get tipsy) I will wake up in a wet bed almost certainly. The amount of alcohol consumed is not excessive. It is very stressful to sleep in any bed other than mine (cottage, camping). [/INST]  Her psychological theory might be worthy of exploration, but you should consider consulting a urologist. A urologist has specialized knowledge regarding urinary tract and reproductive problems. One of their specialties is urinary incontinence.Alcohol is a diuretic. One approach to eliminating this problem is significantly reducing your alcohol intake or not drinking at all. Aside from ending the enuresis, there are many psychological benefits to reducing or eliminating alcohol.Counseling could help you to determine if there is a psychological component to the enuresis. But first, consult a urologist to determine if the problem is physical.You have the same psychological issues and mindset every night when you go to sleep, but you only have a problem on certain nights. Those are the nights when you have been drinking. Perhaps something as simple as not allowing yourself to drink a certain number of hours before sleep would be enough to cure your problem.Until you find the cure for your problem, I would not drink in the evening knowing that enuresis will follow. It is important not to do anything that you know will cause enuresis. Please discuss this with a urologist.Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  My daughter is 19, she still lives with me. She loves to watch movies like twighlight and she reads a lot. She can not find a job, but she does go to college, she is in her second year. My husband and I noticed that she is by herself most of the time. No boyfriend or many friends, she only have 1 or 2 friends and they just text once in a while. For many years she takes long showers,she is in the shower for 45 mnts to an hour and she stay in the bathroom for almost 2 hrs. [/INST]  You are right to be concerned. It sounds like your daughter has been increasingly isolating herself. Although successful in that she goes to school, her friendship circle is very limited for someone her age. Although it’s not unusual for people to talk through problems or to review their day with themselves in the privacy of the bathroom or their own room, your report that she may be punishing herself by screaming and slapping isn’t typical or okay.Sometimes our kids can’t tell us what is troubling them so they consciously or unconsciously leave hints around so that we’ll find them. Kids sometimes “accidentally” leave a diary open where we’ll find it or “accidentally” leave a distressing email open on the family computer, for example. It’s their way of sending out a distress signal without having to quite take responsibility for doing so.I’m guessing your daughter’s lengthy time in the bathroom is something like that. On some level she knows that you will be concerned about a two-hour stay in there.It’s past time for you to respond to the signal. Find a therapist who specializes in young adults. Ask your doctor for a referral or click on the “Find Help” tab on the PsychCentral homepage. There may also be a behavioral health clinic at her college. Brief the therapist on the phone and ask for some guidance about how to get your daughter to go in. (Sometimes it’s helpful if a parent goes to part of the first session.)Then, in a loving way, let your daughter know how concerned you are. Tell her that you know that she is upset and that you want to help. Reassure her that she doesn’t deserve to be punished by herself or by anyone else – no matter what. Insist that she see the counselor. Tell her you are willing to go with her. Don’t argue. Don’t get mad. Stay in that loving, concerned place.Parenting doesn’t end because a child is at the age to start leaving home. We all have to figure out when to let go and when to still pull the “parent card.” In this situation, your daughter is telling you without words that she needs you to be a mom. Please follow through.

"<s>[INST] From a teen in England: It started 6 months ago, now I live with my grandparents because of this issue. Basically my mother started getting into card readings and then she started to buy crystals. After that she started to say that our house was haunted and started screaming Jesus quotes in the middle of the night around 11pm to 3am. Then she started to put salt all over the floor and around the sofa and started sleeping there instead of her bed I heard her whispering to herself and she said she wasn’t crazy and just writing a story (which I didn’t believe). [/INST]  I’m so glad you have grandparents who are able to take you in during this difficult time. I think you know your mother is in trouble. I hope your grandparents can talk her into seeing a doctor. Sometimes behavior like this is actually due to a biological/medical problem. That’s the first thing that needs to be checked out, especially this is a new and sudden change of behavior. If she is medically fine, then she needs a mental health evaluation. You can’t make any of this happen. I hope, I hope that either your mom’s parents or her husband can.I know the whole situation is terribly hard on you. You have every right to feel angry and scared and upset. I hope you can remember that no one acts like this because she wants to. Something is going on with your mother that she really can’t help.The best thing you can do right now is to just love her, and focus on dealing with your own situation as best as you can. You can’t control what your mother decides to do. But you can control how you move your life forward.Focus on finding a way to connect with new school mates. Join a club or team. Figure out how to do well in your new school. Please don’t be shy about asking teachers for help if you don’t understand their expectations or if you find you need a little extra help. Sometimes the subjects in a new school don’t quite match up with what was happening in the old one. This is hard but the way your wrote your letter makes me think you have what it takes to manage it.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am terrified for my health, and I always worry about it. If there is something even slightly wrong with my body then I worry about it. For example, headaches and I immediately think I have a tumor or something. Chest pain and I think I’m having a heart attack. Stomach pain and I think I’m having an appendicitis, and the list goes on. I find it hard to sleep at night as I am always aware of my heartbeat and find it hard to get enough air, I’m sure it’s anxiety because it only seems to happy at night when I’m thinking about it. I am terrified when I go to the doctors and hospitals, like I’m always scared as to what they’re going to say and what they will find out via tests and stuff. My heart is racing whenever I’m in a doctors surgery. I also have very bad performance anxiety (as I do A2 music so have to perform a lot) but I don’t know if that is related at all. I cannot perform as well as I do when I practice as I’m just too scared. I also do tend to worry about random day to day stuff, such as talking in front of people. Do I have anxiety? And what can I do about it? I want to talk to people about it but I feel silly and childish. [/INST]  Based on the description of your symptoms, anxiety may be the most likely explanation. Persons with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) feel anxious about many things rather than any one thing in particular. Many people with GAD can function at a relatively high level when their anxiety is mild. However, it still interferes with their lives. It decreases their quality of life. Symptoms also tend to be more severe in times of stress.Anxiety might be the problem but it’s important to recognize that only an in-person mental health evaluation could definitely determine a diagnosis.You should never feel “silly and childish” about seeking help for anxiety. You would not feel silly and childish if you had an aching tooth and went to see a dentist. Most people realize that they should see a specialist for their dental problems. They never feel foolish for needing a dentist. They don’t think “my tooth hurts and I should know what is wrong and how to fix it.” Most people don’t think that way about needing dental work. Nor should they think that way about needing to consult a mental health professional for psychological problems.Anxiety tends to grow progressively worse over time. Left untreated, it can be quite debilitating. However, very effective treatments exist for anxiety. Because anxiety is one of the most common mental health problems, it can be relatively easy to treat with the right therapy and medication. Research studies have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy is one of the best types of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders. Medications often begin working right away and can lead to instant relief of symptoms.I hope you will reconsider seeking treatment. When psychological problems arise, it’s always wise and efficient to consult a mental health professional. They want to help you and they have the expertise to do so.With the right treatment, you can eliminate anxiety from your life. There’s no reason to continue to tolerate a life disrupted by anxiety when effective treatments exist. It’s simply unnecessary. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ll start by saying that I have been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and I try my best to handle it. [/INST]  You learned, through research, that having a first-degree relative with schizophrenia increased your chances by 13% yet you are worried that you “will…automatically develop the disorder because my mom and possibly grandmother [have] it.” If that were true your chances would be 100% but that is not true; it is 13%. The proof is that most people who have schizophrenic relatives don’t develop schizophrenia. This is one way that your fears are unrealistic.Scientists haven’t identified the cause of schizophrenia but generally think it’s a result of a complex interplay between genetics and environment. Genetically, an individual with a history of schizophrenia in their family might be slightly more likely to develop it if something in their environment triggers it. Environmental triggers often include severe trauma or drug abuse. Even when both ingredients are present (i.e. a genetic propensity and an environmental trigger) the likelihood of developing schizophrenia is still very low. Comparatively speaking, prevalence estimates indicate that it is a rare disorder, inflicting only about 1% of the population.The key to decreasing anxiety is to believe in the facts. In your case, you were diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and not schizophrenia. That fact should decrease your anxiety. If it doesn’t, it means you’re choosing not to believe the diagnosis and choosing to worry that your therapist is wrong. The way to correct this mistake is making the choice to believe your evaluators. The operative word is “choose.”The evaluators were likely aware of your fear of developing schizophrenia and still issued an anxiety diagnosis. They didn’t do that to spare your feelings; they did it because you didn’t meet the criteria for schizophrenia. If you review the criteria for both disorders, you would see that they are very different disorders. It would be very difficult to mistake one for the other. Trust the professionals, who are trained to know the difference between the two disorders. Again, you have a choice to make: to believe or to not believe the professionals.I want to also add that it is common for people with anxiety to think they are developing schizophrenia. I’ve mentioned this many times in this column, but it is worth repeating: it is one of the most frequently asked questions by people with untreated anxiety disorders. I think this is because people with anxiety often engage in a catastrophic style of thinking. They essentially fear the worst-case scenario. In the minds of many people (even the non-anxious), schizophrenia is considered a worst-case scenario.The fact that you currently believe that you might have schizophrenia, despite evidence to the contrary, suggests a catastrophic style of thinking. You would greatly benefit from counseling. Counseling will help to decrease your anxiety by correcting your thinking. Once your symptoms are under control, your fear about developing schizophrenia will lessen or be eliminated.You are making major life decisions based on unfounded fear and not on the facts. These decisions can hinder your psychological growth. Decisions require realistic evaluations. This problem can be easily resolved with counseling. I hope you will give it a try. Please take care. </s>"

He has “cheated” on you in more ways than one. Yes, he was unfaithful by cheating with the other girl. But he is also “cheating” by hiding his relationship with drugs. Yes, that is cheating, too.This man is not the honest man you deserve. A relationship based in lies isn’t going anywhere.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  For years i hated my sister so much. there are things she does that i really hate. my family is divorce. My sister and i are with my mother. She had surgery years ago due to stress. I listen to everything my mother says, i fix the house when it comes to plumbing, computers, TV, networking, bathroom tiles, ceilings, etc. i work every hard and i really dont ask for anything and i respect others. My mother tells me not to yell at her or tell her what to do and my mother can not discipline her because she is worried she will have surgery again. I cant do anything because i dont want to stress my mother as well. therefore my sister can do what ever she wants. [/INST]  I’m so sorry you are under so much stress. Somehow you’ve been made into the man of the house when you’re only 18. Your sister is only part of your problem. She couldn’t get away with any of this if the adults in your life didn’t let her. The only comfort I can offer you is that you are learning how to be a responsible adult with many skills and your sister is learning how to be a spoiled brat. I don’t know if everyone expects you to take care of things because you are the oldest, the boy, or both. But, whew! This is really too much to ask of a young guy.Don’t waste your time trying to change your sister. From her point of view she has no reason to change. Her relationship with your mother is their relationship, not yours. Bow out of any attempts to discipline her. It’s not your job. It is only stressing you. And it isn’t doing any good.Instead, focus on your own relationship with your mom and the other relatives in the family. Since you shoulder so much, they probably have no idea that you are stressed out. Be your most mature self and ask for some help. Encourage your mom to get some counseling so that she isn’t stressed by sis and so she can learn new ways to handle her. See if your dad is willing to take on some of the repairs. He may be divorced from your mom but he’s still your dad and it’s reasonable to ask him to help you.Then start to figure out what you want to do with your life and take some steps to get there. You’re in your senior year. I hope you are letting yourself enjoy this last year of high school at least some of the time. It’s also your time to think about what you want for your life after graduation. Sit down with your guidance counselor and take a look at your options. Not interested or ready for college? There are many options that could take you away from home for awhile so that you have the chance to grow. You might find it helpful to take a look at my article “Are You Ready for College? Alternatives for the Unsure” that is in our library.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My in-laws are insistant that they can buy whatever they want for my daughter (she is 22 months old) It has bothered me but I have kept the peace. For Easter they bought her a live baby bunny as a pet after my husband and I said no. They tried to give it to her at a time when my husband was not there. I refused their gift and my mother in law yelled at me saying they would not have rules as grandparents and would do whatever they wanted in front of my daughter. She stopped speaking to me after this and I wrote an email days later calling them disrespectful for buying a pet for my 1 year old after we said no. It has now been almost 2 months and MIL would not speak to us. I emailed to see what we needed to do to be a family again and she demanded I apologize to her or she wouldn’t get past this. I did and then she said she didn’t accept, continues to insist she will do whatever she wants and we are still not speaking. I want to get past this. But I want respect. If we (the parents) say no-no one has the right to do something against our wishes for our child. And I’m just talking things that are not appropriate for a child her age. They didn’t consider that we have 2 cats and a dog already in our home, or that we would be responsible for the expense of the bunny, that my daughter is not old enough to care or be responsible for a pet and therefore it falls on me. I’m sorry it hurt their feelings that we said no but its our my child. Can our realtionship be saved for the sake of my daughter? [/INST]  Your in-laws are way out of line. As far as I can tell, you have done nothing wrong. You have the right to set reasonable boundaries around your in-laws’ relationship with your child. The important word is “reasonable.” It is certainly reasonable for you to not want another pet. You’re right that you would end up caring for it. It is not reasonable for your mother-in-law to think she can do and say anything she wants just because she is a grandmother. That entitlement doesn’t come with the job description.Where is your husband in all of this? You shouldn’t be negotiating boundaries on your own. This is an important developmental milestone in the maturing of your own family. Your husband, their son, needs to be clearly on the same page with you. The two of you – together – need to decide what is in the best interests of your child. You need – together – to have a loving talk with your in-laws. You can certainly tell them that you appreciate their interest in your daughter. You can tell them how important it is for your daughter to have loving grandparents. But you can also tell them that it isn’t appropriate for them not to honor your role as your daughter’s parents. It isn’t at all supportive of your authority as parents if your daughter understands that she can always appeal to a “higher court,” her grandparents. It isn’t healthy for her to grow up with tension between the two generations of people who love her.When you have this conversation, it’s important that you stay loving and clear, not angry. Engaging in an argument gives the impression that you can be talked out of your position. Supporting each other means staying clear and rational.I sincerely hope that you and your husband can work together to resolve this situation. Often grandparents like these do back off when they realize that the younger couple really means it when they assert boundaries.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My large family is planning a reunion next summer and being with all of them is too anxiety provoking. I don’t want to go. I love them, I just can’t be with them all at once. How do I tell them this with assertiveness and getting what I want instead of just going along to keep them quiet? I fear they won’t understand. (From the USA) [/INST]   I appreciate how difficult speaking up for your needs can be — yet I deeply admire your courage and strength in doing so. Let me offer three possibilities. I am sure there are other options, but these give you some leeway in responding.The first is a heartfelt letter that you would write and distribute to the group ahead of time explaining your love and decision not to come. This will allow you to maintain a connection, share your love, and yet not be expected. Secondly, you may also want to consider going, but staying very briefly. This strategy has worked when, for a myriad of reasons, a family member knew they could not stay too long in the presence of so many people. The work here is to be certain you have a place to go, be able to connect with the people you want to connect with, and then be certain to have a destination to go to afterward. Finally, a simple decline to the organizer of the event should do it — with regrets and not a lot of explanation.The important thing regardless of what path you chose is to honor your feelings and find a way to make them known and act on them.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My sons (ages 7 & 5) have been caught quite a few times talking about, looking at and touching each other’s private parts. I’ve explained to them that this is wrong, and yet they continue to do it. What can I do to make them stop? Please Help [/INST] The first thing you do is stop freaking out. This is normal little boy behavior. Your boys have discovered a wonderful body part that can do interesting things. They are naturally curious and fascinated. When you react with concern, alarm, and scolding, it complicates things considerably. The negative attention may in fact reinforce the very behavior you are trying to stop. Of more concern is that it may make them ashamed of their bodies.“According to healthychildren.org’s website, the following is a list of what pediatricians say is normal, common sexual behavior in children aged 2-6 year’s old.“It can be easy for parents to talk with their children about the differences between right and wrong, but it is often more difficult for parents to talk with their children about sexual development. At a very young age, children begin to explore their bodies by touching, poking, pulling, and rubbing their body parts, including their genitals. As children grow older, they will need guidance in learning about these body parts and their functions. When these behaviors happen, try to redirect your child’s attention to more appropriate behavior by saying something such as, “Grown-ups do that in private, and you should, too.” Reinforce that children should respect each other, and it is not OK to touch anyone else’s private parts. Also, remind your child to always tell you or another trusted grown-up if anyone ever touches his or her private parts.”They also offer some Body Safety Teaching Tips for Parents:“Use appropriate language. Teach children proper names for all body parts, including names such as genitals, penis, vagina, breasts, buttocks, and private parts. Making up names for body parts may give the idea that there is something bad about the proper name. Understand why your child has a special name for the body part but teach the proper name, too. Also, teach your child which parts are private (parts covered by a swimming suit).Evaluate your family’s respect for modesty. While modesty isn’t a concept most young children can fully grasp, you can still use this age to lay a foundation for future discussions and model good behavior. If you have children of various ages, for example, it’s important to teach your younger children to give older siblings their privacy. Usually, older siblings will teach the younger ones to get their clothes on, for example, because they might have friends over or because they are maturing and feel modest even in front of their younger brothers and sisters.Explain what a good vs. bad touches are. You can explain a “good touch” as a way for people to show they care for each other and help each other (i.e., hugging, holding hands, changing a baby’s diaper). A “bad touch” is the kind you don’t like and want it to stop right away (i.e., hitting, kicking, or touching private parts). Reassure your child that most touches are okay touches, but that they should say “NO” and need to tell you about any touches that are confusing or that scare them.”Your kids do not need scolding. They need education. This is a good time to get some kids’ books about the human body. Help them learn the right names for their body parts and to understand that all boys look the same and all girls look the same. Fred Rogers of “Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood” used to sing: “Boys are fancy on the outside. Girls are fancy on the inside. Everybody’s fancy. Everybody’s fine. Your body’s fancy and so is mine.” That’s all they need to know for now. They don’t need in-depth sex education. They just need body education.Instead of telling them that exploring themselves is “wrong,” have a discussion about privacy and personal boundaries. You can help them understand that their bodies are special and private. Knowing about their bodies and understanding what is culturally acceptable is the basis for healthy sexuality later on.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.K.: I’ve been diagnosed with “Asperger’s Syndrome”. It’s been a label that’s been stamped on my personality. It’s something I know I have, but never been clear exactly on what it is. When I was younger, certain traits and tendencies were more evident as a child. Which raises the question: Have these evolved into other “aspie” traits and behaviours I’m not consciously aware of? It’s know I have but unable to clearly and consciously identify any character traits associated with the condition. [/INST]  Thank you for writing.

"<s>[INST] When with others I like to be device-free. Knowing I have no control over the connectivity of others, I am inevitably presented with someone’s phone in my face as people I am with want to show me a photo or something on Facebook (which I deliberately took myself off of), this repels me but I don’t want to be rude or self-righteous, it makes me not want to be around friends/loved ones, it also depresses me, I am seeking strategies to deal with this. [/INST]  Unfortunately, this has become the norm. Device use is ubiquitous. People seem to have a difficult time putting them down. Many people even use them while they are driving, creating deadly hazards. One recent study indicated that people swipe or tap their phone more than 2,600 times a day. Researchers believe that it is causing serious problems with attention, social interaction and personal development.This is not an easily correctable problem. It something that researchers have been observing for years and the problem has only worsened.You have limited options. As you noted, you can’t control other people. No matter how upset you get it’s not going to change their behavior. You shouldn’t worry about things you can’t change. It’s a waste of your time and energy to worry about things you have no power to control.I see your options as the following: You can ask that they not use their devices in your presence and they may comply. Many people will respond positively if you ask politely. If they’re not willing to put down their devices, then make a mental note and avoid them in the future. Limit the time you spend with people who are the worst offenders.Beyond this, accept the fact that this is how some people operate and limit your interaction with them. Perhaps, eventually, things will change but for now, it seems as though device use is here to stay.I’m sorry that I don’t have a more satisfactory answer for you. I hope this helps, at least in some small way. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a young teen in the U.S.: I think i may be depressed or have some sort of depressive disorder. No one believes me when i try to explain it to them. Around march 14th or 15th of this year i was hospitalized because i was exhausted for no reason, i was drinking water but wasn’t staying hydrated. I was also not eating, i was always feeling down and sad, and i couldn’t sleep at night. I was diagnosed with insomnia and my parents just used that to make jokes out of. [/INST] Insomnia is no joke. Not getting sufficient sleep at any age, but especially as a teen, is serious business. Sleep disorders can cause depression, anxiety, diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. According to a poll done in 2005 by Sleep in America, people who were diagnosed with depression or anxiety were more likely to sleep less than six hours at night. A study done in 2007 showed that people with insomnia are 5 times as likely to be depressed as those who got sufficient sleep. At your age “sufficient” means 8 – 9 hours a night.I urge you to go back to your medical doctor for more tests. I’m alarmed that you were drinking enough but not staying hydrated. There’s more to that than sleep deprivation. I’m also alarmed that apparently you were given a “diagnosis” but not then given a treatment plan to regulate your sleep.If your primary care physician isn’t able to help you, get a referral to a sleep medicine clinic for a sleep study. Such clinics do a thorough evaluation of how much sleep a person gets and how often and for how long the person is awake. You may be sent home with a monitor to wear. More likely, you will be asked to spend the night at the clinic where they will monitor you throughout the night. You will sleep in a comfortable room in a comfortable bed. You can usually even bring your own pajamas.Don’t be scared. A sleep study isn’t painful. Doctors or technicians will monitor you while you sleep. Little disks called electrodes will be temporarily glued to your head and attached to an EEG (electroencephalogram) machine. This will monitor the electrical impulses in your brain while you sleep and will show the technician how you are moving through the stages of sleep. It will measure possible interruptions in the pattern of your sleep. The technicians will also measure things such as eye movements, oxygen levels in your blood, heart and breathing rates, who much you snore, and how your body moves as you sleep.The data from your sleep study will be evaluated by your doctor. You will then have a follow up appointment with your doctor to discuss the results and what may need to be done to help you have more regular and restorative sleep.Please share this response with your parents. I don’t think you are lying or faking. I think you have an untreated medical condition that left untreated will only make things worse.I wish you well. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: My problem is best explained describing a typical incident. This is just the latest of many that have occurred since adolescence. [/INST]   Yes. You should seek help. You are in your 50s and you say this has been going on since adolescence. If you could fix it yourself, you would have done so long ago.My guess is that sometime long ago you came to the conclusion that in order to be good enough, you have to be perfect. When you make a mistake or something goes wrong, you have little to no ability to separate the mistake from your belief in your own worth.A letter doesn’t give me enough information to be able to figure out how and why this got started. I can only tell you that I’ve seen many (mostly) men with this problem and it has its roots in unrealistic expectations, low self-esteem and insufficient role modeling for problem-solving.A counselor can help you get to the root of your version of the problem and will help you reconsider your childhood conclusion that to have any human flaw is to be unacceptable. You will also get some coaching in anger management and problem-solving.I think 40+ years of this distressing behavior is long enough, don’t you. Please get yourself a counselor and make the next 40 years happier ones.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: Well I have to start from the beginning. When we first got together he had told me he got cheated on by his ex in the 8th grade and he suffered from trust issues. For our first year he made me feel like I had to tip toe around him bc everything I did he thought it was proof that I had cheated. I would explain to him that I was the one who had no prior boyfriend and that he was the only guy to kiss me or hold my hand. I finally said enough is enough and broke up with him, and he begged me to stay and magically he stopped with the accusing. Well after our two year rolled around he finally told me that he had cheated on her in retaliation then broke off with her. He hadn’t slept with his ex or his mistress but he lied to me. idk if I can trust him. He has me in a depression I cant get out of bc I love him so much. We had problems before but they are getting better but idk what to do about the lying. For my sanity’s sake. [/INST]  I think you are describing a man who has been growing up. This all started when he was only 12 or 13. Heartbreak at that age can be devastating, it’s true. But it’s also the time when people start to learn about relationships and how to handle rejection. The fact that he was still “recovering” from the breakup when he was 18 or so says to me that he didn’t have the inner courage or the external supports to try again until he met you. He was therefore behaving quite immaturely, thinking that controlling you was the way to keep himself from being hurt. As he discovered, trapping someone doesn’t make a good relationship. In an effort to be honest with you, he told you about something he did when he was an immature 13 or 14 year old. Instead of being sympathetic with the young and confused boy he was, you are holding a 20 year old man responsible for what he did 7 years ago.Please take a deep breath and ask yourself: Do you really want to be held accountable for everything you did when you were young as well? Most of us do things when we are growing up that in hindsight look pretty stupid. But it’s part of growing up.If he has evolved into a decent, honest guy and you really love him, you owe it to both of you to see him as he is now instead of how he was as a young teen. If he learned from his mistakes and loves you as much as you love him, then you can drop the distrust and depression.I wish you well.  </s>"

As I got older, I began to feel like I wanted to kill someone. I don’t want to feel like that, but I do. When I get that feeling, I’ll stop whatever I’m doing and I’ll think about murder and how I would do it. Sometimes I’ll giggle and/or laugh while I’m thinking about it. My parents think that I’m lying and over-exaggerating. I’m not sure what to do, and I’m not sure if there’s some sort of problem going on. Half of my mind tells me to go out and kill someone, while the other half says that it’s wrong and I shouldn’t. I’ve gotten to the point where I have cut myself so the feeling would go away. Is there anything I can do to stop this feeling from becoming too strong? I don’t want to hurt or kill anyone, but sometimes I’ll get that feeling, and I’ll hurt myself instead. [/INST]  It is important that you know that hurting or killing people is wrong. It’s immoral. It should not bring you pleasure to think about hurting people. You might feel this way because someone hurt you and you want someone else to feel the pain that you once felt. Revenge is an understandable human emotion, but it is not a healthy or an appropriate one.You should want to bring goodness into the world and to help people. Most religions have a variation of the Golden rule that they follow which essentially states that you should treat people the way that you would want to be treated. That message should be one to live byPainful emotions are distressing and unpleasant. Some people have good mentors who teach them how to deal with painful emotions when they arise but not everyone is so fortunate. Never having learned these skills could explain why you think about murder and engage in self-injury. Those are unhealthy responses to strong emotions that can be corrected with counseling.It’s good that you have shared this information with your parents because they need to know that something is wrong. You should tell them that you wrote us a letter detailing your concerns and that you want help. Ask them to help you find a therapist in your community. It is especially important because of your self-injury. If your parents don’t take you seriously, then tell a trusted faculty member, family friend or clergyman about this problem.Self-injury is common among people with emotional problems. Counseling could help you immensely. If you feel that you might harm yourself or someone else, contact emergency services. They can prevent you from engaging in destructive behavior.

"<s>[INST] Here is a very rough summary of me: [/INST]  I’m very sorry that you are suffering. I know that it was difficult to write your letter, but you did it and you should be proud. It was the right thing to do. It is evidence of your desire to be happy. I see it as a very positive sign.I have worked with many people who have had similar struggles. They were able to overcome these problems and live a good life. With the right help, I would expect no less for you.Yes, you should seek help. Realistically, it may be a challenge at first because of your paranoia, but you should do it anyway. If you can push through the paranoia and meet with a mental health professional, you are on your way.Treatment works but one has to be open to receiving it and willing to participate in it. The fact that you wrote this letter would suggest that you are open and willing. I see this as yet another encouraging sign. It signifies that you want help. People who are motivated have the best chance of achieving success.The problem with mental health treatment is not that it is ineffective; it’s that many people, for variety of reasons, don’t seek it out. The end result is that many people, perhaps even millions of people, suffer from treatable conditions. Every symptom you have described is highly treatable with both counseling and or medication. Avoid being one of those people suffering needlessly with treatable conditions. Take advantage of the many evidence-based treatments that are available to you. It would be destructive not to do so.The next step is to contact your local primary care physician or insurance company and ask for a referral for a mental health professional. Once you begin treatment, you will be on your way to a more joyful life. Please write again if you have additional questions. I wish you the best of luck. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have this partner in life now who has been diagnosed with Paranoid Schizophrenia since 2008. We have been schoolmates long way on our high school days before. After 7 years we’ve meet again most probably earlier of February 2011. At first, I really don’t have the idea that he has been sick that way. We tried to communicate normally as younger adult, who is starting to feel something in between us, like falling in love. Like the usual couple, we started dating and be together after long talks. It feels like I have the best days of my life after all the tragic relationships I have been through. I always prayed and ask for signs that this would be it. He is the ONE. Before we put ourselves into this, he told me about his health condition. I was really fallen for him. And those signs really meant for him to be called mine. I accepted him wholeheartedly and tried to go more deeply with his life. Then, I have learned the inner side of him, which is the one I totally asked for. we were so inlove but then everything is changing inch by inch till we reach 3 years of being together. In every year we spent, we’ve been into a roller coaster ride. the first quarter was so odd, I called it “the peak season of nightmare”. He can’t be understand. He is somehow vocally hostile for me. and he is brutal in his physical approach to his mom and brother. For 3 years of what we are, the first year of loved and all caress turns into deep sorrow and pain the following years. I can really say, I am deeply hurt inside by all those manifestations he going through and for all the instances that we can’t keep ourselves from too much of an argue. after a year of ups and downs, our love or shall I say my love turns so deeply that grows. I became pregnant from him. yes, we had a one year old child now. but due to his condition, his mom decided to separate us. give gaps in between us behind the child. It was awful, it hurts.. i know deep within him, he was hurt too. he don’t want that way. I don’t know again, for what intent reason, according to his mom, he has been showing too much violent early this year. he don’t want to get contact with me anymore. we are not the same as before. but we use to see each other merely a few hours a week after they have fetch our son in my place. yes! we had child yet they decided that we will not be together in one place. the support is there for the child but as a family there is none. by the way, he was in chronic stage. he is in medication right now. I wanted him to be fully rehabilitated but it is difficult for them to pursue. factors would be: he doesn’t cooperate well though he insisted he is trying. and the family itself is in denial stages. acceptance does varies a lot. is there a chance for us to become as family? can he be back to normal father for his child? I love him and we loved him so much that I am still waiting in vain. please help me. If my stand still be okay? [/INST]  If I understand your question correctly, your partner has schizophrenia but was previously symptomatic, can sometimes be violent and has only just begun taking his medication. You want to know if there is a chance for the family to reunite and if he can be a “normal father.”Those are tough questions to answer. The truth is, only time will tell. If he complies with treatment and does so consistently, then there is a good chance he can remain stable. If not, then his symptoms will likely return.Ask anyone who has a family member with schizophrenia and they will tell you how challenging it can be to cope with the dynamics of the disorder. It can profoundly affect all members of the family. In fact, the challenges associated with having a loved one with a severe mental illness was the impetus for the development of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), one of the largest family-oriented advocacy groups in the United States. It’s a struggle for both family members and the individual living with the disease.Continue to be supportive of your husband but recognize there’s probably only so much you can do. It would be advantageous for you to read about schizophrenia. If you Google the terms “schizophrenia and family support” you will find many resources on the subject. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I hope I’m just a perfectionist, but sometimes I feel like my behavior is too bizarre. I like order, routine, and organization, but I am not sure if I’m going too far with this. If fail anything I gave effort to I will not except it. I will beat myself up over it until I get it. One very unhealthy example of this would be my eating behavior. I want the perfect body and I don’t care how much mental exhaustion I have to deal with to get it. I fast for days and I refuse to eat foods that I deem as “bad”. If I do end up breaking this, which happens during breaks or family reunion dinners, I make up by extreme dieting next few days. Another example would be in school. I will study until I can no longer see words clearly on the paper or the screen, which some people might think is a good habit, so I am not exactly sure about this particular case. Another thing my friend thought was weird about a specific habit I have is washing my hands for exactly 30 seconds. I read about it somewhere that it takes 30 seconds for germs to actually come off, so again I’m not sure if not is actually abnormal. I just feel like people tell me my behavior is abnormal but I just think they’re exaggerating, because most people want to meet the average expectations. But I also do understand that many people close to me point out my obsessions in a negative way so I am just wondering if I am the one not seeing clearly or is everyone else in my life average achievers (sorry I don’t know any other term to use). One other mental process I want to point out about myself is that I see behavior in black and white terms. What I mean by this is that you’re either “perfect” or a “failure”. Clean or dirty. I don’t see topics such as politics in black and white, but behavior and characteristics that describe humans. [/INST] One way to describe your thinking and behavior may be mental rigidity. In other words, you are inflexible in your thinking and behavior. You force yourself to think and behave in a particular way based on artificial, self-imposed standards. That type of “all or nothing” thinking and inflexibility, breeds feelings of negativity and disappointment.For instance, you wrote that you will do something until you are mentally exhausted. That seems unnecessary and extreme. Working until mental exhaustion seems like an inefficient way to do things. Take studying for instance. There are good ways to study and there are “not so” good ways to study. Though it may seem counterintuitive, cramming for a test is a poor way to prepare because it sacrifices the sleep your brain needs to perform adequately. Thus, it would be unwise to cram until mental exhaustion.I can never offer a diagnosis over the internet, thus it would be wise to consult a local therapist about the possibility of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). An in-person evaluation would be best to determine if a disorder is present. No matter your diagnosis, counseling could assist in refining your thinking and behavior. Ideally, it’s best to be flexible in your thinking and behavior. You want to be smart and efficient with your time and energy. You don’t want to over- or under-do things. It’s admirable to have life goals but it could be that your self-imposed rules are causing unnecessary stress in your life. Should that be true, counseling is the ideal remedy. Good luck and please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I always felt like I was supposed to die. A long time ago. But somehow fate got mixed up and I kept on living. Now there is no plan for me and I don’t fit in the grand scheme of things. I’ve been bullied horribly a long time ago. It started in the first grade. I was very low then. I remember praying to God that I would die. I took pride in never snapping and killing myself. It was all I had. I feel like that was the plan though. Like I was destined to kill myself. Fate didn’t expect me to live. Now I feel worthless in life. I’m scarred from my past and I can’t muster up the courage to talk to a girl I want to go out with. I feel like some extra piece of a puzzle that is already completed. I’m lost. Everywhere I have turned has led to failure. [/INST]  I’m sorry about your unhappiness. It seems as though you might have depression. Depression can erroneously make you feel as though life is not worth living. It clouds judgment. It can make you believe in things that are not true and thus come to conclusions that are not true. I think this may have happened in your case. Life has been difficult for you which has led you to incorrectly conclude that you are destined to live a worthless, unhappy life. That’s simply not the case. Nothing could be further from the truth.Counseling is what is needed in this situation. I have worked with many people who felt the same way as you do and with counseling their lives improved significantly. I would highly recommend it for you.Inform your parents about how you’ve been feeling. Ask them to assist you in finding the right therapist. There’s no reason for you to continue to suffer and to believe in things that are not true when help is available. The type of problems that you are facing are the type of problems that therapists deal with on a regular basis. It’s imperative that you finally receive the right help to overcome these life difficulties. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I am now a rising sophomore, but am being treated like I graduated elementary school. My mother and I do not understand each other at all. Firstly, we have very different mindsets. My mom was raised in Somalia, so she was a teenager in Somalia. I’m a teenager in America, so when it comes to raising me I just feel as if she doesn’t understand where I am coming from. [/INST]  You’re right. Your mother doesn’t understand you. But the fact is, you don’t understand her either. Your story is very typical of what happens when cultures collide. Your mother is trying to raise you as a good Somalian woman. You want her to be a middle American mom. Instead of trying to figure out how to navigate the differences in cultures, the two of you are locked in a battle. You are as much at fault as she is. (Relationships do go two ways, you know.) I don’t think she is trying to mold you into a version of herself. I think she’s afraid she is going to lose you to a way of life she doesn’t understand.I suggest you drop your end of the fight. Talk with your mother about what it was like for her when she was a teen. Ask her what was expected of her then. Talk about why she chose to come to America and whether she understood that you would be growing up very differently than she did. This isn’t something to fight about. It’s something to be curious about. Show her that being Americanized doesn’t mean that you disrespect her or her values. Then see if there are some common goals you can work on together.This will take some time and patience on your part, But if you take the high road and show her how mature you can be while you discuss these difficult issues, I suspect she will start to bend. You have time. Really you do. If you work on this gradually, you may be able to salvage your relationship with your mother and have a more typically American rest of your teen years.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] When i was very young we were burgled whilst me, my parents and brother were in the house at night. After this event i had huge difficulty sleeping and became very anxious of being home alone and sleeping in a room on my own. I was even too scared to go across to my parents bedroom for comfort. I often have to go to sleep with the television on. [/INST]  I disagree. I think this is an awful problem. You shouldn’t resign yourself to living a life in fear. You have every right to be furious with the burglars who stole your peace of mind. You have every right to want a life that isn’t dominated by memories of a traumatic event that happened almost a decade ago.I know the therapy at the time wasn’t helpful. But please don’t write off therapy. It could be that you and the thereapist weren’t a good “fit” or that your little-girl self wasn’t able to take full advantage of treatment. Look for a therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress. A therapist can help you come to terms with what happened and learn new ways to strengthen your ability to cope with life’s challenges.I also suggest you take a look at David Burns’s book, “Feeling Good.” He talks about ways to manage overwhelming anxiety in part of the book.I wish you well.

She once took me out with her to go shopping, and when I brought clothes to the changing room, she looked at me like I was crazy for wanting to buy anything (why bring me shopping if she doesn’t want me to get anything???). She doesn’t like when I spend money, even if it’s not her money. She doesn’t like it when I wear shorts(even in the summer heat), or anything semi-nice, I feel like she is slut-shaming me with her eyes, and I don’t even dress inappropriately because of my issues with my body.

"<s>[INST] I’ve been seeing the same therapist for 7 years once a week like clockwork.2 months ago I got frustrated with therapy and my therapist because I felt like i wasn’t improving or getting better. In fact, I felt things were getting worse with me. I told my therapist I need a break from therapy because I’m not getting better. She looked like she really didn’t care and never commented on it during our last session. It’s been 2 months and she’s never even called to see if I’m ok or if I want to come in for a session to talk about it. I’m feeling hurt and abandoned and this reminds me that I can’t trust anyone ever again. At this rate, don’t know if i want to go back to her. It took me a long time to feel comfortable with therapy and now this. What should I do? Discontinue therapy? Wait for her to call? Is this normal? Do patients just take a break and never hear from their therapists? I’m feeling very hurt. I invested a lot of money and time. [/INST] A: I’m sure this is one of those questions in which you could ask five different therapists and get five different answers. Some therapists tend to be very involved and nurturing, while others hold to very strict boundaries. The bottom line is that you are the one who decided to take a break, so shouldn’t you be the one to decide when the break is over? I’m guessing that she is giving you some space to decide how to proceed from here. It’s your treatment, not hers. If you are feeling hurt and abandoned, I’d say that those are issues you should talk to her about, but you will have to be the one to make the appointment.You also mention that part of your reasoning for the break was that you felt you weren’t getting better. Sometimes that has a lot more to do with what is going on in the client’s life or brain chemistry, than whether or not it is productive therapy. However, I personally feel that both clients and therapists can stagnate after working together for years and a fresh approach from a new provider can be very helpful. I’d also refer you to the second half of another question I recently answered, titled “Therapy Advice.”Whatever you chose, I hope that you will not give up on your journey of self-improvement.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] My husband wants me to weigh 115 lbs at 5’8″ and I keep trying to do it because i am afraid not to. This weight issue has existed since we were married in 1973. We have had an abnormal relationship through the births of 5 children. I left him numerous times during my middle thirties when my daughters were teens. I wanted them to know that this was abnormal behavior and explained everything to them so they would know that it was wrong and that I was trying to get away from this treatment. He was abusive physically, verbally and mentally. My problem was that I couldn’t raise my kids by myself. I was in the projects and they started to get into trouble. So I went back to him. In addition, I still loved him and he was promising to change. He worked hard to change. He stopped threatening me and worked hard to stop the abuse. He even worked to stop making me feel bad if I gained weight but he ended up trying in other ways and eventually manipulated me into dieting again. I eventually gave up fighting it. I realize he is suffering with mental illness. I am too. I know I must be sick to live like this. I just don’t want either of us to hurt. I am scared and tired. Right now my weight is 123 lbs and he is telling me how overweight I am and pressuring me to start dieting. He wants me to be around 110 to 115 lbs. I know this is sick but I am really tired of the fight. [/INST]  I am so sorry that you are having to deal with this for such a long time — more than four years! The core problem, of course, is that the subtitle in this relationship is that he won’t love you less you lose weight. Good relationships don’t work like this. This is called a condition of worth. It means that unless you meet the standards he has said you feel unlovable. This is unacceptable. No one should have that much influence over your well-being.Stop trying. This is the only way out of this loop. The moment you try to lose weight to please him you lose yourself. It means that you believe you’re not lovable until you lose the weight. It is time to do something for yourself, if you want to, not for him.This is a vicious cycle. He won’t accept you — and the more you try to win his approval the worse you feel about yourself and then the harder you try again. Stop trying. This is a time in your life when you need to nurture yourself. Find ways to take care of you mentally, physically and socially — don’t let your husband’s pathology become yours.Wishing you patience and peace, </s>"
"<s>[INST] So basically my entire childhood has been deeply traumatic. Since I was 6, I lived with my abusive mother (my parents are divorced). I’ve been chronically depressed for as long as I can remember and I have been spiritually interactive as you could say. From age 7, I could see demons in my waking and sleeping hours (Not to mention I had two childhood friends witch happened to be very terrifying demons that have haunted me for basically my entire life). I have had countless interactions with demons and angels. I have attempted suicide 4 times now. Some of the time I sort of laps into a insane mood when I am alone (about once every week or two) witch is full of uncontrollable shaking, self harm, very sadistic and psychotic thinking patterns, uncontrollable crying, rage and basic psychotic disorder symptoms. I am constantly paranoid and I suffer from severe depression, anxiety, insomnia and compulsive self hate. Keep in mind that I am currently 13. I have received little to no help with my mental problems and have a horrible habit of shoving everything down and hiding what I really feel (therefore my emotions are excessively raw and can overwhelm me at the slightest probing from my mother or basically anyone). I 100% consider myself to be unstable, but I am not sure about insane. Do you think I have Schizophrenia or Psychoses? Thanks for your time! [/INST]  It’s impossible to provide a diagnosis over the Internet. It would be best to be evaluated in-person, by a mental health professional. It could help you to determine and correct what might be wrong.Psychosis among people your age is rare. It does happen, often in situations involving abuse or trauma. That might be the case for you or there may be other explanations for your symptoms. For instance, a recent research study found that 24 hours of sleep deprivation can mimic symptoms of psychosis among people without psychotic disorders. Continued sleep deprivation also impairs memory function, the inability to concentrate, and in severe cases, can cause hallucinations and delusions.You’ve stated that you have a habit of withholding your symptoms from those around you. That is a bad habit that you should work to change. Be honest about your symptoms and ask for help. No one will know what’s wrong if you don’t tell them.I would suggest asking a trusted and responsible adult to assist you in seeking mental health treatment. Your parents might be able to help. Another option is the school guidance counselor. The guidance counselor can speak to your parents about your seeking treatment. Do whatever is necessary to seek help. Keeping secrets only prolongs your suffering. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am a 100% straight 36 year old male, married to my wife 31 for 14 years. We are both straight, moderately attractive and successful. Early in marriage I was quite jealous of any men that would hit on my wife. I was quite insecure. The past 5 years however, I have been pushing my wife into having sex with other men. I have read about cuckolds on the net, and I am not like what I read. I am not bi-curious, and I do not want to be humilated or enjoy that. I simply get incredibly aroused thinking about my very sexy wife having sex and being open and wild with another man, particular while I watch or perhaps participate with her. Is this a disorder or something I need therapy for? Why does this fantasy fill my head whenever I have sex with her and get me incredibly aroused? My wife has agreed that she is ready to try this with a friend of ours and she is beginning to enjoy the thought of trying it. I am actually looking forward to it. Is something wrong with me? [/INST] Your desire to watch your wife have sex with another man may be considered taboo and unusual by traditional standards of sexuality. There are many married couples who engage in open relationships. These couples are free to have sex with other people. There are other relationships where a third party is brought in simply for the purpose of sex.These types of relationships may not fit the conventional model but are nonetheless functional relationships. In our culture sexuality is often not discussed. We might all be surprised to find out the sexual details of our friends’ and neighbors’ relationships. There are sexual variations of all sorts. The question that we should ask ourselves is simply this: Is a couple’s sexual behavior harmful to themselves or their relationship? Most therapists would find any sexual behavior that was not harmful to be acceptable in a relationship. Obviously, we must consider only behaviors that harm no one. Any behavior that would be harmful to the couple or to any other individual would never be acceptable.Your sexual fantasy of seeing your wife participating in sexual acts with another person is an arousing thought to you and recently your wife. The actual act may not be arousing or acceptable to either one of you. Fantasies often do not translate well into reality. Having said that, many pleasurable, stable parts of regular sexual behavior had their beginnings as fantasies. You and your wife may find involving a third party to be a very exciting part of your sexual relationship.However, you may find it to be not at all pleasurable and deeply regret having gone forward. Your wife may blame you for having coerced her into being unfaithful. You might be angry with your wife for having given in to you. You might lose respect for her or she for you. I have listed only a few of the negative outcomes possible. On the other hand, you both may find it to be an exciting and important addition to your sex life. You need to weigh the options carefully and to be quite sure that there will be or is likely to be no negative outcomes.If you were to proceed turning your fantasy into reality, you might break it down into smaller steps. For instance, she might simply go out for the evening with her possible suitor and have dinner or a drink. When she comes home, from what amounts to a fairly harmless encounter, you could both discuss your feelings and reactions. The next step could involve nothing more than a kiss. Again, you would then discuss how it has impacted the both of you. By keeping each step small, you could minimize any damage that would come from a negative encounter.What you are suggesting is not common nor is it extremely uncommon. As I said earlier, there are many successful relationships that involve sexual variation. You could talk to a sex therapist and receive his or her feedback. I would suggest that you be careful, cautious and quite sure that both of you want this to happen before you allow it to happen.I hope that I have been of assistance and if you have any other questions please do not hesitate to write again. Good luck. </s>"

Ever since then I have scared myself because I’m afraid one day I will do that. I’m not a killer I don’t think about actually killing anyone or anything but I have put this thought in my head that I will become crazy and kill someone I love. I couldn’t harm a fly.. But I can’t stop myself from thinking that I will go crazy like that. I think it’s because I have seen to many scary movies and documentaries of serial killers. I am scared of the thought of becoming it I don’t think about killing anyone and I’m afraid of even the thought of it,I even think I gave myself anxiety from worrying about this so much. What is wrong with me? [/INST]  You seem to be struggling with excessive thoughts that are disrupting your life. Those types of obsessive thoughts are associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). I can’t know with certainty if you have OCD but obsessive thoughts are characteristic of the disorder.OCD is an anxiety disorder. Anxiety is a feeling of nervousness, often about an event or something in which you feel uncertain about the outcome. In your case, your obsession involves the idea that you might kill people. One of the best ways to combat anxiety is to utilize logic and to force yourself to believe in reality. The odds of you becoming a serial killer are astonishingly minimal. Most serial killers have a history of violence and a strong desire to hurt others. They don’t simply watch a movie and become serial killers. Focus on the truth and your anxiety should diminish.The possibility exists that you may be in the early stages of OCD and it would be wise to see a mental health professional. A therapist could determine if OCD is present, help you to develop the appropriate skills for dealing with your anxiety and might potentially prevent the development of a mental health disorder. You may only need a few therapy sessions to learn to control your anxiety. Medication might also help to decrease your obsessive thoughts. Please take care. </s>"

"<s>[INST] How do I know if it’s really necessary? I have Bipolar II and am on a mood stabilizer (Trileptal) and a small dose of an antidepressant (Lexapro.)

[/INST]  Partial hospitalization refers to a comprehensive, short-term, intensive, clinical treatment program. With regard to level of treatment, partial hospitalization is a step below inpatient hospitalization but more concentrated than traditional outpatient care. Clients are generally referred to partial programs when they are experiencing acute psychiatric symptoms that are difficult to manage but that do not require 24-hour care.Individuals in partial hospitalization programs attend structured programming throughout the day, three to five days a week and return home in the evenings. To ensure client safety, many of the inpatient hospitalization rules apply (i.e. no phones, no shoelaces) to partial hospitalization programs.There are many advantages to participating in a partial hospitalization program. You are worried that the program may isolate you but the opposite would be true. Many partial programs provide group therapy which would allow you to interact with other people experiencing similar problems. You would also have the opportunity to interact with psychiatrists, social workers, nurses, and other mental health practitioners. The goal of many partial hospital programs is the development of skills that help clients better manage their lives and their symptoms.Consider attending the program. Your doctor thinks it is necessary. I have worked with many clients that had expressed similar concerns about partial programs but who were later glad they attended. Remember that the program is short-term. It has the potential to help you tremendously.At your next appointment, I would recommend discussing your concerns with your doctor. He or she may provide more information about the program which could give you a better understanding of what to expect. I wish you well. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] In the past few years, I haven’t been getting much out of life. I don’t feel anything like I used to. Anger, happiness, joy, and even sadness seem to have left me. Things that used to give me emotional pleasure now just seem to entertain and occupy my mind. I don’t have ups and downs like teenagers are supposed to everything just seems kind of flat with a few dips. Things don’t feel very “real” anymore, the real world feels dreamy and I am constantly withdrawn. My mind is always racing and I have trouble concentrating, even trouble getting to sleep sometimes. [/INST]  Based on your symptoms, depression is a realistic possible diagnosis. To be diagnosed with depression one does not necessarily experience deep and constant sadness. Your symptoms, that may be indicative of depression, include: feeling emotionally “flat,” withdrawn, having trouble concentrating, sleep difficulties, loss of motivation, procrastination, and feeling “down.” These are all signs of depression.What should your next steps be? You should be evaluated by a mental health professional. The mental health professional can verify whether you have a depression diagnosis. Secondly, seek treatment. You’ve noticed a change in your mood and behavior. You don’t have to wait until your symptoms become overwhelming before you enter treatment. Ideally, an individual should seek treatment as soon as they notice a negative change in their thinking and behavior. Third, visit your primary care physician. He or she can rule out a possible medical problem. In addition, your primary care physician can prescribe psychiatric medication.My last and most important piece of advice is to speak to your parents. Let them know about your concerns. They can help you access treatment. Keep this in mind: your parents can only help if they are aware that a problem may exist. Communicate with them as much as possible.I hope this answer helps guide you in the right direction. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, I apologize if this appears jumbled, I feel there’s a lot I need to add! I would like to know whether these symptoms may be pointing towards Bipolar disorder. I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety about 6 years ago. Since then, I’ve gotten married, moved cities and went to university. I’ve also had periods of depression, and auditory hallucinations. During the past three years (noticed it more recently) I’ve been irritable, feeling high and low. Irritable, in the sense that I lash out at my husband for no reason. I just suddenly get angry — when he hasn’t done anything- and start shouting. After, I feel an immense sense of guilt and I will often break down in tears. Other times, I have these sorts of daydreams — but they feel more real than daydreams, if that makes sense. The best way I can describe it is I’ll get an idea in my head and I’ll get lost in it — it can range from anything, a recent example was the idea of being in a famous band. In reality, I couldn’t do such a thing due to being so timid. In this sense I also overestimate my abilities, in believing that I can get anything done just because. When it doesn’t happen the way I imagined, I’ll become depressed and feel generally hopeless, useless. If it is of any use, my grandmother had Bipolar. I apologize if this was muddled, but I’m not sure whether I should refer to a doctor or not, or if what I am experiencing is related to Bipolar at all. Thank you for your time! (age 21, from New Zealand) [/INST]  Thank you for writing in with your question. We all get angry sometimes for little to no reason and we’ve all gotten lost in a daydream, however, when I look at all the symptoms that you have listed here, I think there could be a more serious problem. I’m concerned that you have had auditory hallucinations, report periods of highs and lows and have a family history of Bipolar Disorder.Having Bipolar Disorder could certainly account for the problems that you are having, but the only way to know is to be evaluated by a mental health professional. So, my bottom line is yes, you should make an appointment with your doctor. Even if your doctor doesn’t feel that you meet criteria for this diagnosis, he or she may help pinpoint the problem and therapy can help you better manage your moods and discover more effective ways of coping with stressful situations.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve suffered from depression from a very young age–pill overdose at 14 and mh hospitalization at 21. All of my “relationships” until now have been of a sexual nature and I have been very promiscuous since losing my virginity at 23. I’ve had about 20 partners, most of them as a result of prostituting myself–at 26 and at 30 years of age. I’ve felt like I’ve lived a double life for so long. Despite it all, I’ve managed to get myself in graduate school this year; ironically, I’m going for my MSW. I have been living with my current–and the only person I consider a “legitimate”—boyfriend for a year but dating for two. I question the authenticity or the healthiness of my relationship with my partner because he was initially my “john.” Needless-to-say, I have a lot of insecurities around his faithfulness. We have a lot of problems because I feel he’s not affectionate enough towards me and I’m always seeking validation. I love his family and he loves mine but I don’t know if he’s the one. I think he’s a great guy but I also think he’s as good as I’ll be able to do because no one else would accept me with my past. He’s a typical guy in every sense of the word and gets easily frustrated when we talk about “feelings and emotions.” He thinks our relationship is fine–and for the most part it is–and says I just can’t help but self-sabotage. He’s perhaps the only person that knows EVERYTHING about me–I told him about my depression, he obviously knows about the prostitution–but he uses it against me when we have arguments. I want to make this relationship work but I don’t know if it’s because the only one I’ve ever really had or because I think I’m in love. My PCP, who knows my mh history seeing since I was a teenager, suspects I have Cyclothymia and encouraged me to get professional help. Needless-to-say, I’ve been lackadaisical about it. Sometimes I feel like I want to run away from everything because no one will ever understand me but I also feel like I want to try to get better. I’m confused about my relationship and I wonder how much my mh instability is affecting my expectations? Or am I really asking for too much? [/INST]  First I want you to know how much I admire your courage for pulling yourself together and making it into graduate school. MSW programs are not easy to get into and the fact that you want to use your evolution to help others is to be celebrated. People who have recovered from life’s hurts almost always make good therapists.Let’s not, as the ’60s slang phrase goes, push the river. So far you have been systematically evolving and resilient in making changes in your life. You are having more of what you want and less of what you don’t want. This means your life is moving in the right direction. Someone who self-sabotages is typically ambivalent about their circumstance – so if this is your concern, keep talking about what you want and don’t want in a relationship. Clarity is the antidote for staying in an ambivalent situation. If you keep moving toward clarity the risk of sabotage goes down.I am assuming you are already in therapy, but if not I would encourage you to use the services at the graduate school you are attending. This will help with the process of clarifying.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My husband and I have been together for 4 years. We have 2 sons and I have a daughter from previous relationship. He is her dad, has been the only dad she has known. Last summer we were separated and I left out of town leaving my daughter with family. A week before I came home, my daughter went back home. My husband wasn’t coping well with the thought of losing his family and I don’t think he was thinking clearly. He sexually abused my 7 yr old daughter for 2 nights. He rubbed his parts against hers until he finished. The 2nd night he had her get into shower and kissed her down there. After that it stopped, a few days later I returned. She told me and I took her to the doctor, no signs of penetration. I left him for a few weeks and ended up going back. I know that he is sorry and he says he doesn’t know why he did it. It hasn’t happened again and we all sat down and talked about what happened and I continue to talk with her about how she is feeling and if she wants to stay with dad or not. She says she forgives him, her behavior hasn’t changed. She seems fine, for now. DO you think it is possible to move on past this and be a family or do I just run for the hills? Could it have been his state of mind at the time? I’m so confused whether or not to try to make this work. Am I stupid for staying or is there a chance to save our family. [/INST] I can only begin to imagine all the conflicting things you are feeling. What your husband did was sexual assault on a 7 year old. He may not have “penetrated” but he violated your trust and introduced your daughter to sex in a potentially very damaging way. I’m surprised the doctor didn’t report him to child protective services. He should have. Yes, I understand that your husband wasn’t thinking clearly at the time. But people who are upset don’t generally act out sexually on a helpless and trusting child. He made a terrible choice that isn’t excused by being “upset.”I think your family needs more help than talking it out together. Your husband needs some counseling by a qualified therapist in order to understand why he would even think about harming your child and how he’ll prevent such a thing from ever, ever happening again. I know he says he won’t do it but how can either of you know that? You never in a million years thought he was capable of this in the first place.In the meantime, you need to keep your children safe. If it’s possible, I usually suggest that the man leave the house until he’s done his therapeutic work. At the very least, he should never be left alone with any of the children. (People who abuse kids sometimes abuse both boys and girls.) I also think it’s important to have your daughter evaluated by a qualified child therapist. At 7, I question if she knows what “forgiveness” means. It’s possible that she is saying what she thinks you need her to say. She certainly shouldn’t be made to think that what she says determines whether her father stays or leaves. That’s simply too much of a burden to put on someone so young. I understand that you have good intentions in talking with her but I’m concerned that you may be unintentionally making things more difficult for her.In answer to your question; Yes, I think it’s possible for a family to get past even something as serious as this. No, I don’t think you’re stupid to try. But I think getting everyone beyond this takes more than good intentions, talk, and promises. It takes willingness to face the problem squarely and to do the hard therapeutic work. You made a positive first step by writing to us here at Psych Central. Now, please take care of your children and your family by following through and finding the professional help you need.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have always regarded myself a different person in a way that I do not pursue shallow qualities in girls I am attracted to. However, I have noticed a pattern in my romantic relationships that just keeps on repeating. Right now I have a girlfriend, I had so much wanted to get together with, but after we did get together, after just a couple of days, I suddenly started being repulsed by some of her physical attributes. Basically, everything I could not care less about before we started dating, suddenly became repulsive. This feeling of repulsion comes and goes, sometimes I feel really happy, that I am finally in a mature relationship, but then comes this feeling and I am not sure what I am supposed to do with that. It seems that every time when we engage in some kind of erotic activity, whether it is passionate kissing or something more intense ( we have not yet slept together ) I forget about those things I find repulsive. But out there when we are just hangi ng out, or learning together, just casually kissing, or especially when I am alone, these thoughts come back, and I become unsure, whether I should stay together with her or not. I do not want to have an intercourse with her, only to abandon her few days after. I just don’t want to hurt her or any other girl anymore, as I have done in the past. I think I have only fallen madly in love once, when I was around 13-14 years old and since that time, I have always blamed this one girl for dumping me. I think that I have developed some kind of defense mechanism, which prevents me from getting more attached to people I get attracted to at first. I would appreciate any kind of advice. Thanks in advance. (From Austria) [/INST]   I admire your insights on this and your courage to express it. I think you are exactly right. The repulsion is a hedge against abandonment. The betrayal from early on at 13-14 leaves you wanting the connection and intimacy — but ready to bail on her if things start going south. It is typically a defensive strategy to protect oneself from abandonment. But whatever protects also inhibits. This is what is happening, causing the ambivalence.I would encourage you to engage in some brief individual therapy to confirm, understand, and heal this type of response.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I am transgender and have been living as male for two years. So my transition is going great, and I almost have zero depression or dysphoria. Which is awesome, but something else has happened in the past couple of years, and I have only really noticed it recently. And I haven’t told anyone about this either. [/INST]  I can only offer a guess. You really need to talk this over with a therapist who can hear your whole story and who can ask the follow-up questions that need to be asked to come to a real understanding.So here’s my guess: No news to you, transition is difficult. You started the process when you were only 16. That’s a time when most teens are working out who they are and how to relate to others. You were working on an additional layer of concerns and, perhaps, fears. The need to have compassion for yourself may have overwhelmed your ability to have compassion for others.Feeling our feelings and knowing what to do with them is part of the process of maturing. In your case, you may have put off some of that developmental task while you came to terms with who you are.If you aren’t in therapy already, I urge you to find an experienced trans-friendly counselor to provide you with guidance and support as you work on becoming all you can be.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] In the last few months, my mom has become convinced that she’s sort of the center of the universe. She often thinks radio stations are made only for her and playing music that speaks only to her. She also has become convinced that someone has hacked her YouTube account and is purposefully playing certain songs to try to tell her something. She often claims to speak to people that have passed away but when you ask her if she means that she’s spoken to a dead person, she says no only that these people are somehow in her head, but she knows they’re actually dead. She has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis for the last ten years or so and I know that researchers have discovered a link between multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia, so I figured it was certainly possible that she has it. She also has been diagnosed with depression and was taking medication to treat it for a time, but she has since quit taking that medication and all of her other medication. She also freaks out everytime there is a sudden noise and she’s convinced that that’s not normal at all and she becomes sort of scared like something is going to happen. She will sometimes make comments about wanting to start seeing her doctor again or seeing a psychiatrist as if she’s aware what she’s doing isn’t normal. I’m not sure what to do or how to help her or if I’m even on the right track. Thank you in advance. [/INST] You are right to be concerned. These are unusual behaviors and may suggest psychosis. An evaluation is required. You should encourage her to consult her physician. Perhaps accompany her to the appointment. She may be reluctant but going with her could ease her fears.Once at the doctor’s office, report your concerns. Your observations will be tremendously helpful. As you mentioned, she might have a sense that something is wrong but may be frightened to pursue it further. Thus, it’s important to report your observations to her treating physician.If psychosis is present, generally the symptoms worsen without treatment. The sooner her symptoms are treated, the quicker this problem can be remedied. Time is of the essence.You should also inform her doctor that she has stopped her depression medicine. She should not have stopped it on her own as there are negative side effects that can arise from doing so. The more information they have about her condition, the easier it will be to treat it accordingly. Good luck with your efforts. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hey I am 15, been home schooled my whole life. Never had friends and I am a outcast. Females hate me I am tired of seeing all these girls with a bunch of female friends partying or at the beach. I have no friends at all. I love psychology, serial killer stories and horror movies, dramatic photography and gore. I cry myself to sleep and cry all the time. I have broke down recently. I need alcohol just to be okay. [/INST]  No you don’t need alcohol to be okay. Alcohol has become part of the problem. You won’t find the friendships you crave by sitting in your room, crying and drinking. Nobody is going to knock on your door and say, “Hey – I like photography too. Want to hang out?” Nope. That’s not going to happen. And drop the negativity stuff. Watching horror movies and killer stories is just filling you up with gunk. It makes you unattractive to people who are fun.The big plus of homeschooling is that you can go at your own pace and pursue subjects and interests in more depth. The down side for at least some kids is that they don’t grow up knowing how to relate to peers. It takes real effort to find a large enough pool of candidates for friendships to equal what is available in a big school.If you want other girls to be your friends, you have to drop feeling sorry for yourself and get busy. At 15, there are lots of ways for you to get involved in your community and to get to know people who might become friends. Join a photography club for teens. Start taking classes for teens at the local community college. Get a job as a camp counselor this summer. Help out at something like Special Olympics. Join a gym that has yoga classes or jazz exercise classes for kids your age. You won’t make friends instantly but any one of these will be a start toward being with peers. Often when people are focused on a job or goal, not on each other, it takes the pressure off. Friendships are likely to evolve once you start being around a lot of teens who are doing something worthwhile.Yes it will be difficult at first. Staying put is hard too. You might as well do something hard that is going to pay off, right?I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello. I developed a crush on a celebrity when I was 10 and it has grown into an obsession that I can’t stop (I’m 23 now). I’ve been diagnosed with generalised anxiety and have had depression in the past linked to poor self-image/esteem. My family relationships are good. I’ve had two relationships, one when 13 and the second when 15. The first time I was used by him and for 3 years until I got over him, whenever he was dating someone I would try hard to look like them (hair/makeup/clothes etc.). The second was emotionally abusive but I broke-up after a month and never wanted to reconcile. I thought about this celebrity less while in relationships but never fully stopped. Since my teen years I’ve fantasised about them: being in a relationship, conversing with them, being intimate (sexually) etc. When in a relationship with another female celebrity I became obsessed with her and still am, saving hundreds of pictures of her, watching all the interviews I could because I wanted to act, sound and look like her, eat, exercise and use the same beauty products as her if I could find that information. Whenever seeing pictures of them I feel a painful pit in my stomach. I would follow pages on instagram that followed them. After they broke up I stayed obsessed, less than initially but still, focusing more on whoever he’s currently with/dating (he’s with a regular girl now). I’ve tried to pursue his interests (e.g. art and watch the same TV shows) and also more recently tried to even use the same products and dress the same way he does if I can find that info (But I don’t want to be a man). I’m seeing a clinical psych and she said she’s unsure and to just avoid checking their social media (tried many times and even after over a month of abstaining from all social media it never worked). I’ve tried journaling, meditating, talking to friends and some things help a little but not much. I can barely differentiate what I like and what him/his girlfriends like. I can’t concentrate for a few minutes without them popping in my head even when I don’t want them to. Avoiding doesn’t help and I don’t want to, nor replace it by forcing myself in a relationship. I want to confront it so I never have the issue again. [/INST] Though they are few in number, there are studies about celebrity worship. Those who have studied the phenomenon observe that celebrity worship exists on a continuum. At one end, celebrity worship is akin to being a passionate fan. A fan is an individual who is enthusiastically devoted to the support of something or someone.At the other end of the spectrum are individuals whose celebrity worship is considered unhealthy and problematic for their lives. This type of worship involves expressing excessive empathy with a celebrity’s successes and failures and obsessively tracking the details of their lives. In extreme cases, pathological worshipers progress into stalking or other types of dangerous behaviors.Celebrities and other public figures are at a greater risk for violence than they have been historically. This is especially true for celebrity athletes. The advent of the internet, especially social media, has made it easier for fans to interact with celebrities in a manner that was not available previously. Social media may cause some fans to believe they have a more personal relationship with a celebrity than they do in actuality. Social media also has the potential to magnify the intensity of a fan’s feelings and fantasies toward the celebrity.Studies have indicated that individuals who engage in celebrity worship display the following personality characteristics: sensation-seeking, cognitive rigidity, identity diffusion, poor internal boundaries, and narcissism. Individuals who demonstrated medium and high levels of celebrity worship were prone to fantasies and disassociation.Being prone to fantasies means that an individual regularly engages in the cognitive activity of imagining situations, ideas or stories that are impossible or improbable.Disassociation involves feeling detached from one’s physical and or emotional surroundings or one’s own identity. It is commonly associated with individuals with a history of traumatic experiences. It is considered an unconscious coping mechanism that evolves in response to painful experiences. In short, disassociation is a psychological mechanism that temporarily numbs unpleasant emotions.When you think about it, it makes sense that being prone to fantasies and experiencing disassociation are correlated. An individual who is prone to imagining improbable events, and thus caught up in their imagination, may struggle to feel connected to their surroundings.Studies also suggest that individuals who engaged in celebrity worship often had sexual thoughts and feelings about their favorite celebrity, were more apt to struggle with addiction, had tendencies toward engaging in criminal behavior, including stalking, and were prone to compulsive buying. They also had higher levels of depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, social dysfunction, and reported lower levels of overall life satisfaction.The aforementioned research is not to suggest that you have any or all of these traits or symptoms. Thus far, the research in this area is limited and more work is necessary to determine what underlies celebrity worship.You mentioned that you began worshiping your particular celebrity of interest at the age of 10. It remains with you 13 years later, though to a lesser degree. It could be that this is a behavior that you have grown accustomed to and or it provides some level of comfort in times of stress.You’ve tried to stop but are struggling. Part of the problem may be that you are unwilling to stop. There is a difference between being unable to stop and being unwilling to stop. You seem to be indulging your obsession. Think about it. You are purposefully tracking your favorite celebrity and their love interests. If you didn’t search for that information, it is unlikely that you would know about it. It is a choice that you are making. The good news is that you can make a different choice.You’re in counseling and that is a good but you may need a different therapist. The two of you seem to be focused on the celebrity worship as opposed to the underlying motivation that is driving your behavior. A different focus may help. If no progress is being made, then a different therapist should be considered.It’s good that you are open to treatment. It significantly increases your probability of success. It may be that you simply haven’t found the right help. If you’d like to explore other options, contact three or four therapists over the phone and talk to them about this issue. Choose the one you like the best and meet with them in person. Choose the one with whom you feel the most comfortable. That person will likely be your best choice. Thanks for writing. Good luck and please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am in a long term relationship with my boyfriend. His best friend stays in the same apartment as us, and there are very little boundaries set between our relationship and their friendship. Every now and then, my boyfriend’s friend will use our bathroom, in our room, or come directly into our room to look for socks, etc. When he is off from work and when we are off from work, he is always around, hanging out with us. [/INST] It looks to me like your boyfriend’s relationship with his best friend is at least on the same level of importance, and maybe even more so, than his relationship with you. I can think of at least a few possible explanations but you would need to talk with him (if he even would) to really understand what is truly going on.Of course, it is possible that the two are lovers. It’s also possible that your boyfriend can’t manage the intensity of a single committed relationship with one person so he dilutes it by being in relationships with two different people. I suppose it’s also possible that the “best friend” has something on your boyfriend and has blackmailed him into this arrangement. Your boyfriend may feel obligated to this arrangement. That particular option seems unlikely given the way they end their messages with xxx and “I love yous”.Whatever the reason – Your boyfriend is showing you by his behavior that he’s a two-fer. If you are willing to accept the terms, he is willing to talk about marriage and kids. If you put your foot down and try to set clearer boundaries, I think your boyfriend will find a way to say goodbye to you. (I could be wrong. You will only find out if you take the risk and ask.)You probably have a hard decision to make: Do you agree to buy into a life of sharing your partner with someone else. And committing to a life with a person who doesn’t take into account your thoughts and feelings? Or do you make the tough decision to part company and go through the time and effort it takes to find someone who can be committed to you alone? In situations like this, it’s important to look ahead to the next 40 years and see which of thee options feels better. Only you can decide. I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My girlfriend seems to always have something wrong with her. As soon as one thing stops hurting, the next day something else hurts. 4 months ago she started getting very queasy when she ate anything, and would vomit it up, eventually. She was only able to keep food down once a week or so. It got worse, where she couldn’t hold down water even. She stopped eating altogether. 5 trips to the emergency room only resulted in treatment for dehydration and instructions to feed her light or clear food. She still couldn’t eat. She’s lost 85 lbs. (She’s overweight to start with, but still unhealthy). We got a hospital to admit her, but nothing physically is wrong. But now she has become paranoid and psychotic, she’s sure everyone is plotting against her, even myself and her daughter. She’s been in the hospital 14 days now, transferred to the psych ward, and is on a hold for at least 2 more weeks. What’s happening? How did it get to this? Her physical symptoms seem to have gone away, maybe, but the psychosis is scary. [/INST]  There are some psychotic disorders that begin as physical symptoms or complaints about physical symptoms. In clinical terms, they are called somatic delusions and their origins are poorly understood. Somatic delusions are associated with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, among others.Her physical symptoms have subsided but the psychotic symptoms remain. Fortunately, she is receiving inpatient care where her condition is being monitored around the clock. The treatment team can observe her symptoms and determine the best treatment before discharge. Most likely they will recommend medication. If she follows their treatment recommendations, it significantly decreases the risk of re-occurrence.For your part, encourage her to follow their treatment recommendations. Medication is highly effective for psychosis but it will not work if she stops taking it. Treatment adherence is paramount.It is common for people with psychotic disorders to stop taking their medications. There are many reasons why they stop, including unpleasant side efforts or more commonly, because they feel better or don’t think they need it. Some people with psychosis are unable to recognize that they are ill. An inability to recognize one’s illness is considered a symptom of certain psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. Do your best to convince her of the importance of medication. It is the best “insurance policy” for avoiding a relapse. Some research suggests that with each subsequent relapse it can take longer to recover. Thus, adhering to the prescribed treatment regime is the key to stability.In the meantime, it would be advantageous for you to read about psychotic disorders. They are many resources for family members who are caring for a loved one with a psychotic disorder. Psych Central has great resources, as does the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), and the Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC). The more knowledge you have about psychosis, the more prepared you will be for caring for a loved one with a mental illness and supporting your family in the process. Please write again if you have additional questions. I will be glad to help in any way that I can. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for almost two years now. I’m 19 and he is 21. To put it bluntly, he’s not the nicest guy. He calls me names and sometimes he’ll act controlling towards me. When I tell him I want to end our relationship, he’ll act like he doesn’t care which freaks me out enough that I never ACTUALLY end things. We’ve “broken up” before and I always contact him practically begging for him back because I literally go insane without him. It’s like I can’t breathe sometimes when I’m not with him and it is a dreadfully terrifying feeling. I have become completely dependent upon him for my happiness. The thing is, I know he treats me horribly. He loves to call me stupid and he gets angry at me now for practically no reason at all. The last reason he called me horrible, horrible names was because I didn’t respond to him quickly enough through text messages. Sometimes he’ll act like I’m not allowed to have my own opinion. He’ll threaten to break up with me if I don’t agree with him on something so I always end up agreeing even though I think otherwise. Lately, he has called me a bad name pretty much every day. He really never treats me well. I sympathize with him when he’s sad, I apologize when I do or say something wrong or rude, I try to talk rationally instead of calling him names. He never sympathizes with me, instead he’d choose to laugh at me. If someone does something to upset me, most of the time he’ll take their side. He very, very rarely apologizes. He’s probably apologized a total of 10 times in the entire two years that we’ve been together. He’s told me before that his ex is better than me and that he doesn’t actually love me. That he has just told me he does so I’ll be happy. With each new, horrible thing he says to me, I think to myself “this is the last straw, I will not put up with this anymore.” But then the next day I start to miss him and I contact him. It’s honestly like I cannot control myself. I know that this is bad and I know that I SHOULDN’T be with somebody like that but I feel that I’ve become so dependent on him that it’s nearly impossible for me to be without him. When we’re broken up, I am so depressed. Every ounce of joy is literally taken out of my life and I’ve thought of suicide because of it. I just don’t know how to live, or function, without him. I don’t have a job either. I have nothing to do during the day but talk to him and I’m in my house most of the time because I have anxiety around people and most of the time I’m afraid to leave my house.

"<s>[INST] First of all, I want to thank you for having created such an amazing and helpful website. Now, I’m going to try to be as precise as possible in describing my issues, and I hope that it will be enough so that if you ever reply to me you can help me. [/INST]  You are maturing and trying to become the person you are meant to be, and it’s causing a bit of friction between you and your parents. You are exploring new ideas about yourself and trying to find your place in the world. That is a normal part of human growth and development. In that way, there’s nothing “wrong” with you. There is an old American song by Neil Sedaka, called “Breaking Up Is Hard To Do.” A more relevant song title would be “Growing Up Is Hard To Do.” And it is. In fact it is very hard to do.Erik Erickson, a psychosocial theorist, referred to this developmental stage of life as identity versus identity confusion. During adolescence, is very common for there to be a discrepancy between who your parents want you to be and who you want to be. Sometimes misguided parents want their children to be extensions of themselves. Teenagers, faced with those circumstances, often rebel because what their parents want them to do doesn’t match their own personal interests and goals. It can cause a great deal of tension between them and their parents.The fact that you are already in treatment is great news. Counseling is the ideal place for learning to navigate the types of problems teenagers commonly have with their parents. You should also consider temporarily including your parents in your therapy. Family therapy might be the perfect resolution to this problem. It’s better to address these problems directly than to ignore them and to allow them to fester. Good luck and please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My husband(57) is a Phys Ed teacher and sports coach. He deals with thousands of students every day, but he always seems to have his favourites — normally girls of 18-20 who pour out their problems to him about being raped by family members/friends and appeal to his fatherly/protective side. There was even a case where the young girl was sending nude photos to him on her phone — which unfortunately my teenage daughter happened to see. We all went for counselling a few years ago, but now he has this relationship with a young girl who he coached softball last year. I picked up some vibes last year and challenged him but he said they were very close and he was helping her with some issues as she has been raped by her uncle at an early age. [/INST]  You’re not overreacting. It’s typically very much frowned upon for that close of a relationship between teacher and student. It is far too much contact — and clearly inappropriate. But the most difficult part about this is that it really bothers you, and he is choosing to maintain the relationship rather than honor his wife. Also his past behavior indicates that he has obvious difficulties in setting boundaries.It is time for couple counseling. You may want to talk to the therapist you had earlier to help sort this through. I would do this sooner rather than later. Without a third/party intervention by a therapist, it doesn’t sound like he has the ability to properly manage himself sound students.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am so fed up with the fact that I was born the way I was born. I am ugly, fat and have no motivation. It is so hard to watch TV because all I see are pretty people with lots of money. It is hard for me to go to the store or anywhere for that matter because everyone around me is prettier, skinnier, an richer than me. It is heart breaking that I have to live with myself. It is getting harder and harder to wake up in the mornings. The only peace I have is when I am asleep. I pray something horrible will happen to me just so I don’t have to continue another day of agony. I have started drinking more than usual. I wake up and need a beer to calm my nerves. I recently graduated college and I am having no luck finding a job, I live with my husband’s parents and I feel like such a piece of crap. I don’t want to feel this way because I have a daughter, but I am finding my drinking becoming more and more of an issue. I really need help. I feel so ugly I dont even want to show people my face. Sometimes I overeat, over drink and smoke to make myself feel comfortable in my own skin. Help. I am losing control and I am on the edge of giving up on everything.. [/INST]  There are several issues to address here. Foremost among them is the fact that you may be depressed. The content, tone and theme of your letter is consistent with an individual who may be experiencing depression. Your self-perception is negatively skewed. You have described yourself in very derogatory terms. Those are typical signs of depression.Some individuals with depression utilize alcohol as a method of self-medication. They drink because it temporarily numbs their negative feelings. Chemically speaking, alcohol is a nervous system depressant. It may be contributing to your depressed mood.Although it is common to do so, comparing oneself to others can provide an inaccurate view of reality. Your situation is very unique. Thus any outward comparisons that you make can never be fully accurate.You are being unreasonably critical of yourself. You both maximize the negative aspects of yourself (i.e. “ugly, fat and no motivation”) and the positive attributes of others (“prettier, skinnier, and richer”). There are no objective standards for beauty or for what is desirable. There are doubtlessly people who look at you and consider you prettier, richer and thinner. Those people are not necessarily unhappy or depressed because they see you that way. For almost everyone, wouldn’t it be safe to say that there are people in the world who are prettier, skinnier and richer? Wouldn’t this even be true for movie stars?Should only the richest, the prettiest and the thinnest person in the world be allowed to be happy while all of the runners-up are forbidden happiness? Of course not. Happiness is not something you win in an outward contest with others but instead something that comes from deep inside.As you stated, you are “on the edge of giving up on everything.” Now, more than ever, is the time to seek help. If not for yourself then do it for your daughter, whose mental health and well-being is largely dependent upon having a psychologically healthy caretaker.Counseling could provide the objective third-party perspective that is necessary in this situation. It could also provide necessary direction, guidance and support. Check the find help tab, at the top of this page, to locate professional psychological services in your community. Please take care. </s>"

Use this letter as a guide as to what to say.If you’re honest with her, she might stop and everything may return to normal. It’s important that you provide honest feedback to her. You’ve known her for quite a long time. She can handle the truth.If you withhold this information from her, it may cause resentment and lead to your prematurely ending the relationship. If you tell her the truth and her response is inappropriate, at that point, it may be time to find a new therapist. Give her a chance to explain herself.

[/INST]  The fact that you worry about going to prison might prevent you from harming strangers, but it does not seem to prevent you from wreaking havoc in the lives of those closest to you. There are occasions when you purposely harm them and subsequently feel no remorse. These are worrisome behaviors and responses.I can’t answer the question of what is “wrong” with you, on the basis of a short letter, but generally speaking you seem geared towards harming rather than helping people. How you treat people is a choice. You can choose to do good or you can choose to do harm. For reasons that are not well understood, some people choose the latter.In a broader, more philosophical context, our choices are considered good or evil. To help someone or to relieve their suffering is considered good. To do the opposite, to intentionally behave in ways that harm people, is considered evil. As the famous Stanford psychologist, Dr. Philip Zimbardo explains, “Evil is knowing better but willingly doing worse.”The first step in changing negative behavior is acknowledgement. By acknowledging these issues and by asking your question, you are behaving responsibly and in my view, trying to change your behavior. It would suggest a desire to change. That is hopeful and encouraging.Your next step should be asking your parents to assist you in finding a local therapist. Counseling will help to correct your thinking and behavior. You will learn how to move away from behavior and tendencies that could lead you into trouble. If you were to carry out your fantasies, you could be facing a lifetime in prison or, depending on where you live, the death penalty. You must do everything in your power to correct this problem. Counseling is the ideal solution. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Okay well I’m 17 and I was in a car accident with my best friend and well it wasn’t my fault, this woman didn’t stop at a stop sign and she hit us, I had a concussion and my friend was okay but basically we were both fine, nothing serious but the other woman, she died. I feel really bad, but now I can’t drive, I’m just too scared to! My parents don’t understand that i literally cannot drive a car, is this normal? I don’t understand…im so frustrated because I need to drive, how am i suppose to get to school and work? How can i overcome this stupid fear so i can get on with my life? [/INST]  Of course it’s normal! Before the accident, the dangers in driving were an abstraction. Now you know from your own experience how fragile life truly is and how much we depend on others following the rules to keep us safe. Your fear isn’t “stupid.” You’ve temporarily lost your ability to shut off the awareness of dangers — something we all have to do to get into a car or plane or train without freaking out.Further, I imagine you are sad for the woman and her family and may even feel what is called “survivor guilt.” As much as you are relieved that you and your friend are okay; as much as you acknowledge that the woman was at fault; you still may feel that it’s unfair that you should live and she would die. That’s also a normal dimension to a close call like you had.The first thing to do is to give yourself time. You didn’t tell me how long ago the accident happened. But if we’re talking only weeks or a month, give yourself a break. Take time out from driving to give yourself time to fully recover.Then put yourself quite literally in the driver’s seat. Just get in a car and sit there. Don’t start the engine. Just sit in the car and slow your breathing down. You may have to do this several times before you feel comfortable. The next step is to start the engine. If that panics you, again just stay put and calm yourself. Do this as many times as you need to. Next, just drive up and down the driveway. Etc. Take each step slowly. Calm yourself. Do it until you are comfortable. There’s no rush. Take it step by step until you are driving to work and school. Over time, you’ll be fine – with one important difference. You will probably be a much more alert and careful driver.If you aren’t successsful after a week or two, you may need the assistance of a coach. Talk to a therapist who specializes in anxiety and trauma. The therapist can tailor the program more specifically to your needs and can provide you with needed support.You’ve had quite a traumatic experience. With time and some coaching, though, you can get through this so that you can get on with your life.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am writing to find a manner to cope with or gain insight into my wife’s behavior. There are probably multiple areas but I will attempt to summarize in the allotted space. [/INST]  It is very true that the first step to getting better is admitting that there is a problem. As long as your wife blames others for the problems in her life, she cannot take control of the situation. If others are to blame, she cannot change them because she cannot control them. From your description, she has a substance abuse problem. In her suffering she is hurting those around her.She is misperceiving reality. You cannot trick a therapist into “siding with you.” She rejects your interpretation of the problem and she rejects the therapist’s interpretation because it differs from hers. Since she believes that she is right, she needs a rational explanation for why the therapist agrees with your assessment. She knows that the therapist is both well educated and intelligent. So why would the therapists with all of their training and intelligence agree with you? Because you have tricked them.There is often more to a story. I would need to hear your wife’s version of events. It makes it impossible to provide specific advice without it.I’m not sure what you meant by the expression “nearly out.” I interpret it to mean that you cannot or are not willing to tolerate much more of her behavior and are considering ending your marriage.Three things that you might want to consider before deciding on divorce are: 1) individual therapy, 2) an intervention or 3) a short separation.A therapist could gather many more details about your relationship and assist you in determining your next move. Ending the marriage could be particularly traumatic for both you and your family. It’s important to have a great deal of support when considering or pursuing such matters.Couples therapy may have been ineffective but perhaps she would be willing to enter treatment for her drinking. If she’s unwilling to go to rehab, then an intervention may be necessary. An intervention would involve confronting your wife, in the presence of concerned friends and family, describing how drinking has negatively affected your family and your marriage, and asking her to enter treatment. Should you choose to pursue an intervention, it would be advantageous to consult a family therapist or professional interventionist before attempting it on your own.Finally, you might try a temporary separation. Being apart might afford you the opportunity to gain a much-needed, fresh perspective about the relationship. Ending your marriage should be a “last resort” option, after you have tried everything within your power to keep the relationship together. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] So I have no close friends at the moment probably I know some people enough just to say hi but no close one and whenever I make any they go away I don’t know if its my personality the reason or the way I behave and the only friends I can gain are school friends since there is no other place I go to I can’t really stand myself alone. Thanks for helping. [/INST] You mentioned that you have no close friends “at the moment.” That would suggest that you have had close friends but something recently has changed.Maybe the people you are meeting right now are not a good match for you. No one befriends every one they meet. You are going to like some people more than others and some will like you more than others. That is the nature of social interaction.It’s also common for people to have mostly just acquaintances and only a few close friends. Close relationships are very time consuming. They require a great deal of energy and commitment. Most people simply do not have time to have many close friends. Meaningful relationships are typically few in number.If you are concerned about your ability to make friends, it would be wise to consult a professional. Unfortunately, I simply don’t have enough information to know if there is a problem. An in-person therapist would be in the best position to answer your question and correct whatever may be wrong. They will help to determine if your perceptions are accurate.There may be nothing wrong with how you interact with people, but if there is a problem, a therapist will help. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am having ongoing difficulties in getting heard and am feeling really discouraged to the point that I don’t want to bother trying to communicate or assert as I feel it doesn’t work anyhow. I’ve done numerous communication, assertiveness and conflict resolution courses and use the suggested techniques (outline the facts, stating the feeling, wants and at times a positive or negative consequence using neutral language, I statements, asking the other person/s what they think, what would work etc). But I don’t get heard. At work I don’t get taken seriously by a colleague I work with on a joint project, my asserted work needs & suggestions get ignored. I’ve discussed this with my manager asking I be included on planning meetings they have explaining I could raise my work needs & suggestions & I work better when I have the context rather than be given bits of work. I make many suggestions of how I can contribute meaningfully on work projects but am getting more & more admin work. I wasn’t employed to do full time admin but in a skilled role needing qualifications. I’ve done work I’ve been given well & enthusiastically. I’d like to discuss this concern with my manager but fear I won’t get heard as nothing has changed when I’ve discussed things with my manager in the past. I coordinate a group, we meet to agree on dates & events for the year. At times have people cancel at the last minute meaning an event has been cancelled. I’ve face to face & via email asked that they advise they can’t come as soon as they know so that as much notice of an event cancellation can be given to give the 1-2 who can make it time to make other arrangements & avoid last minute disappointment. I’ve phrased this by giving the facts, acknowledging things come up but to advise ASAP, the impact of last minute event cancellations on others especially hosts but there are still last minute cancellations. I’d suggested people feel free to arrange additional impromptu events but said if someone were to do so please RSVP quickly either way otherwise no one will want to organize anything if no one responds. The other week I’d issued an invitation to have only 1 person acknowledge it. With initiating new friendships I’m so discouraged there as despite joining many things I feel afraid to initiate things as people often say no they are too busy. So I target activities that are ongoing so I have contact with the same people so friendships build slowly without initiating too early to be knocked back. In past workplaces I’m often not included in pub invites or lunches with others who do a similar job. Advising I know of such events and would be interested in being invited doesn’t work. I hence now feel awkward and shy, not wanting join in informal activities (e.g. invite myself to sit and chat to the other tenants in my block of flats who sit int he front garden) preferring more formal structured activities. I’m at a dead end here. I’ve been to therapy, been told I have good communication skills, I have no personality disorders. I’m generally positive, well presented, interested in others, talk about a wide range of things, keen to get out there. I don’t bitch or say negative things about people. I’ve worked hard on communication and assertiveness. I just don’t feel like continuing to try. [/INST]  There is an expression made famous by fictional character George Costanza from the hit TV show Seinfeld. When he wanted to break up with someone, he said, “It’s not you it’s me.” In this case, I might say, “it’s not you, it’s them.” In some respects, what you may be describing is the nature of people.Take, for instance, the last minute cancellations by your coworkers. You sent out reminders and requests asking people to respond by a particular date because you knew what would happen if they were to wait. You did everything you could to ensure a particular outcome and still it did not work. There is nothing else you could have done.Many people wait until last minute to do almost everything. One good example is taxes. The analysts from FiveThirtyEight.com wrote an article with an informative title: “Everyone Files Their Taxes at the Last Minute.” They characterized Americans as a “nation of procrastinators.” Over 20 million people waited until the last minute to submit their tax returns. It’s not personal; some people (perhaps many people) are procrastinators.Anecdotally, I noticed this same kind of procrastination among college students. Most students write their papers “last-minute.” Certainly, there are some conscientious students who spend the appropriate amount of time working on their papers. They start in advance, leaving enough time for proper editing and refinement of their papers, and so forth but it is not the norm. They are procrastinators. It is not personal; it’s typical.Maybe your coworkers meant to RSVP but forgot because they were too busy. Some of them may not have been courteous enough to reply to your RSVP. Others are undoubtedly procrastinators. The main issue is not necessarily the behavior of your coworkers, but your emotional reaction to it. Rather than be disappointed, adjust your expectations. Avoid taking it personally. They have the right to live their life their own way, just as you do. Respect that right. They will fail or prosper based on the choices they make. Do what you can to help but back off completely when you recognize that your help is not wanted.It may be that you have yet to find the right friend or group of friends. You may be searching for friends in all of the wrong places. But you should not give up. It takes time to develop quality friendships. Good relationships require a great deal of energy. Expand your search for friends beyond those only in your spatial proximity. I hope this helps, if only in some small way. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My spouses ex is consistently in our life trying to cause extreme stress in our life by threatening to withhold my step-child as a way to torment us, by threatening to cause us financial hardship, by overall just being overly hostile in any possible way. In the last few months we’ve been in and out of court, there has been domestic violence in the other household which has caused us to worry about the safety of our child, and various other torments. I typically donate blood, and have not been able to because for some unknown reason my pulse which is normally in the 80’s has rarely gone under 130 in this time. I honestly feel like I am going to die eventually from the extreme stress in my life, sometimes I can’t move, I know I should but I just can’t. I constantly feel like in my chest something is just constricting me to the point of not being able to breathe consistently. I first thought that maybe I was having a panic attack, but panic attacks are supposed to stop at some point from what I read. I’m at a point where I don’t know what is going on with myself, I’m honestly terrified that my spouse’s ex will drive me to a point of having a heart attack or something equally horrible. I don’t know what this is though, I don’t know how to fix it, and I don’t know if this is just a normal thing people go through if they are under extreme stress. [/INST] A: I’m sorry that you are all going through this difficult time and hope that things get better soon. We all respond to stress differently. Some react with more physical responses, others experience extreme emotional changes, while some folks demonstrate both. It is crucial for our overall health to develop insight into our own tendencies and to then have a plan to combat the stress reactions. Since you are having some concerning physical symptoms with an increased pulse rate, chest constriction and breathing difficulties, I would suggest that you see your doctor for a complete physical. Hopefully there is nothing seriously wrong, but it’s a good idea to be monitored during this time of high stress.Obviously, seeing a therapist during this time would be a good idea as well. Therapy would provide a safe and neutral place to vent about the situation, but it’s also a way to increase your coping skills and learn new ways to relax while managing the ongoing situation. I would also suggest that you get a book or take a class on meditation, yoga, Tai Chi or some other form of mindfulness based practice. There’s a lot of research coming out showing the benefits of these types of techniques on our overall mental health and our ability to manage stress. Let’s face it, we live in challenging times and we will periodically go through times that push us to our brink. However, we can equip ourselves with self-knowledge and methods of coping that serve to keep us on track. We can’t always change our situation but we can change how we react to it. Good luck and I hope there is a peaceful resolution soon.All the best, </s>"

I of course am not really believing in that sort of ridiculous comment, so I try to calmly explain to her why such a thing can’t exist. She gets really mad, screaming mad, then can’t keep her mouth closed for at least 3 hours no joke. She keeps yelling at me like “Why don’t you believe in such things, this is why you’re such a loser, you suck at this, you suck at that, you have to start believing in being a god to be one.” Now before I go further, she says I “suck” at things that I already quit from, like previous sports I didn’t enjoy.

"<s>[INST] Hi, I’m 14 years old and in the 8th grade. I came here because my anger has been really overwhelming me and causing problems. Like usually when I’m angry I think about hurting these people in horrible ways or hurting myself sometimes even and this scares me a lot. I’ve even thought about killing someone and planned it out in my head and this is terrifying to me? I mean its something I’d never actually do like I couldn’t probably bring myself to do it because I am not a violent person whatsoever, but i definitely think it. I think maybe it’s because I’m young or if there’s another possible problem I really want to know. I’ve told my mom sometimes I think violent things when I’m really angry, but I never elaborated off that. I’m scared she’ll send me to some mental institution or something. I just want to stop thinking like this. I’m scared that one day I just might act on it. [/INST] A: I’m glad you wrote in with your question. I know it’s hard, but first thing to do is talk to your mom again about your problems and be very honest. Let her know that you really want to get some help with the angry thoughts that you are having and tell her how worried you are about them. You won’t be sent to a mental institution for this (unless you really do try to hurt yourself or someone else), but it would be great if you could talk to a therapist about your feelings and learn some ways to handle them. It is really important to get help now, while they are just thoughts. Don’t take the chance of waiting and risking doing something you can’t take back.It might also be helpful to speak with your school counselor. They may have some groups at school for anger management or coping with stress, or they might be able to meet with you individually. If you are involved with a church or youth group, it could be helpful to speak to one of the leaders there. The important thing is to reach out and get some help.There’s a big difference in having thoughts versus acting on them. If you learn to deal with your feelings now while you are young, chances are that it won’t lead to bigger problems later. You might also want to check out another question I answered about anger on PsychCentral for some other suggestions: I Don’t Know Why I Get So Angry.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] So I have this annoying phobia that if I don’t have a water bottle or water source by me at all times I start to panic. It’s really bad in gym class becaus the coaches hate it and so does my band director. I had to go in an ambulance in January because of an anxiety attack and dehydration which started the phobia, it got worse when I saved my brother from choking. I have few friends and the whole school day only see them at lunch and then don’t talk to anyone the rest of the day. I really want to get rid of this phobia! Please help. [/INST]  That anxiety attack really, really scared you! Now you are so worried that you’ll get dehydrated again that the worry has become the problem! A normal fear has gone haywire. Fortunately, phobias can be treated. Behavioral therapy has been found to be especially helpful. Often the therapist uses a technique called “progressive desensitization.” You are gradually exposed to your fear more and more so that you learn to manage it.Another method emphasizes relaxation techniques. Being relaxed is incompatible with fear. By learning to relax when you find yourself without water, you can calm yourself and remind yourself that you can wait, that water is probably readily available once you have time or opportunity to get it, and that the fear is irrational. Hypnotherapy is still another technique that many people have found helpful for getting free of phobias.I suggest you ask your parents to help you find a therapist who specializes in phobias. If you commit to the treatment, I’m pretty sure you’ll learn to overcome the phobia in a short time.Meanwhile, your lack of friends is probably not related to the phobia — unless you are so focused on getting water that you aren’t much fun to be around. You need to do something to increase your circle of friends. I suggest you consider joining a team or another kind of extracurricular activity so that you can get to know more people – and they can get to know you. Another route to finding friends is to volunteer. Many kids get to know other people by volunteering to help manage a sports team or by assisting in the office.Friends don’t happen by magic. That’s why it’s called “making” friends. And – btw – there are lots of other kids who want friends as much as you do. Be on the lookout for other nice people who seem to be alone a lot. Your’re all walking around hoping someone will “friend” you. Someone needs to make the first move. Why not you??I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have a hard time not being able to control my anger towards my mother. Every time she does something that irritates me i get really angry and start to breath heavy and have the need to break things, after that i start to cry and whisper to myself “I hate her, i hate her.” I dont know where my anger towards her comes from but it has always been this way. I really cant stand her. If it wasn’t for my younger brother i would not talk to her at all, But he needs me, so im dealing with her just for him. Im not diagnosed but im certain i suffer from depression and i would not be surprised if i have something else, since mental health issues runs in the family. I get easily upset and angry, but especially with my mother. I dont know how to deal with things and i dont want to break things, so i end up clenching my fists or pushing my nails into my arm or even biting my self hard just to not break anything, i’ve hit myself in the head many times just to try to get rid of my anger, im hurting myself and i dont want to do that, but i just cant control it. Im to afraid to go to someone who can diagnose me or help me since i know my family would be disapointed, and it would be really bad for my younger brother. He really looks up to me and i dont want to hurt him in any way. I know my health comes first, but i care too much for others. (age 20, from Sweden) [/INST]   Yes, your health should come first and taking care of yourself would be the best way to be a good role model for your little brother. Wouldn’t you rather teach him to deal with his problems directly rather than deny them?I am not sure why you get so angry with your mother either, but I do think it is worthy of looking into it with the help of a trained professional. Hurting yourself in order to deal with these feelings suggests that you could benefit from improved coping skills. Learning to better understand your feelings and developing a variety of problem solving techniques will not only help you now but for years to come. Perhaps a therapist can also help you understand why you have such extreme feelings about your mother.Lastly, if you are concerned about what your family would think of you seeking help, why do they need to know? Therapy is confidential. No one needs to know that you are going or what you are going for. If for some reason it takes a while to find a mental health counselor, I would suggest that you get a book or workbook on anger management so that you can immediately address your issues.All the best, </s>"

Our last marriage therapist told me to leave and that I was in serious danger, she was concerned for my safety. We had 2 marriage therapists say they felt he had a personality disorder with antisocial tendencies. I have read books about antisocial and narcissistic personality disorders and ADD. They seem to all desribe him to a T. My husband is in his mid 30’s and in special forces active duty in the US Military. He is on his fourth medication……from paxil to provigile to aderal now to cymbalta and none have made a dent in his compulsiveness or paranoid behaviors or ragefulness. How do I know if he has ADD or a personality disorder? I am struggling with the decision to divorce because I don’t know what end is up or down.

A therapist who knows you is worried for your safety. In spite of treatment, your husband continues to be rageful. That’s enough to make me concerned for you.Perhaps you need to take the input from your helpers more seriously. If your husband loves you, he doesn’t want to hurt you. Perhaps the two of you should consider whether a separation until he has a positive response to treatment is advisable. Separation might protect you from being hurt and him from hurting someone he loves. If you want to stay married, couples therapy while you are separated can help.

You could learn more about what you need to do to support his treatment and, at the same time, take care of yourself.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: Can you offer guidance for how to provide limited help and set appropriate boundaries with needy, personality disordered family members? [/INST]  Your difficult relatives are fortunate indeed to have such a compassionate and caring person in their family circle. You are certainly not alone in having aging or needy relatives who are less than wonderful. But knowing that isn’t very helpful, is it?I wish I had an easy answer to your question but I don’t. I do have some opinions but please do take into consideration that I only have a brief letter to go on.I worry about the present emphasis I see everywhere about the importance of “boundaries.” Too often, it implies putting up a wall. I think it’s more useful to define it as putting up a shield. Walls keep people out. Shields deflect the barbs of words and opinions so a relationship doesn’t hurt us.I therefore don’t agree that it is ever helpful to get “hard.” I do think you need to find ways to let the behaviors of the difficult people and the words and opinions of others roll off you.There is an old saying: “Consider the source.” You don’t have to take in what these difficult people or uninformed people say. You don’t have to argue. You don’t have to justify, apologize or explain anything. Ideally, you will find a way to smile and nod and say innocuous things like “I’ll think about that” or “Thanks for sharing” and move on.Then — and this is the important part — go to people who know the situation and who care about you for the hugs, validation, and support you deserve. You are blessed to have a stable and happy family. Don’t let the occasional visit with challenging people overshadow that.Compassion isn’t something that people have to deserve. We do what we can to ease the lives of elderly and/or difficult people because it is the right thing to do. But it is equally important to do right by yourself by turning to your own network for support so you can keep it in perspective.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] For the past two years or so I have noticed my emotions are altered randomly, either for some insignificant reason, or no reason at all. My emotions tend to cycle in order from being generaly content, to a lethargic, unmotivated, depressive “my future is hopeless no matter how hard a try” way of thinking. It takes a toll on my current relationship. My boyfriend and I have been dating for a bit over two years, and he says I haven’t always acted this way. It’s hard for me to take note of my own emotions, because I feel that they are norma, and logical. I often become upset about something random my boyfriend says or does (or doesn’t do, in some cases). At the time, I feel like I’m being completely rational. But in the morning, or about a day later, I realize how ridiculous I was acting. Unusually, I can’t even remember why I was upset in the first place. This just happened today, and here I am about 12 hours later, and I can’t remember why I was upset with him. It’s very stressful for my boyfriend, and it’s upsetting for me as well because he really shouldn’t have to deal with this kind of stress, and I feel my random crying and melancholy emotions are really unnecessary. [/INST]  It is possible that the emotions you are describing are random but generally there is a reason behind our feelings. The reason may not always be evident or easy to identify. That can be a challenge. If you keep track of your thoughts and feelings you may discover a pattern or trend. For example, you might notice that you begin to experience unexplainable emotions a few days prior to your menstrual cycle. It’s not unusual for women to experience “random” emotions right before their menstrual cycle begins. This is called premenstrual syndrome (PMS). A characteristic of PMS is mood swings. That might explain why once your menstrual cycle ends you feel happier. Think of PMS as a time when emotions are exaggerated. Many women describe feeling overly emotional at least a few days a month. Some women experience PMS more strongly than others. For women who have extreme PMS they are sometimes diagnosed with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). This condition is associated with severe depression and irritability before a menstrual cycle begins.The fact is that women have an extra challenge when it comes to dealing with their emotions and the reason is often the result of hormonal changes related to menstruation. Men do not have this challenge. They do not experience the same type of hormonal changes. Once you recognize this biological fact, you may be better able to manage the unruly emotions when they occur. Generally speaking, we cannot control our emotions but we can control our reaction to them.How can you better manage your emotions? One way is to use logic. Emotions and logic are like oil and water. They don’t naturally mix unless you force them to. Using logic to manage emotions is not always easy and it does take practice, but it can be done. When you feel an emotion that seems random, try to analyze it. Examine it and try to understand its origin. If there is no logical reason behind it, recognize that it may be related to hormonal changes and let it go.Also recognize that being tired can cause emotional instability. This is true for everyone, not just women. If you feel irritable for “no reason” recognize that it may be the tiredness that is causing you to feel a certain way. Acknowledge this and try not to let it rule the way you feel. The idea is to get into the habit of analyzing your emotions, trying to determine their origin, deciding whether they are legitimate and not letting them control your mood.On the other hand, the emotions you have described may not be the result of PMS. There may be another explanation. It’s possible that you may be experiencing depression or anxiety, although much of what you’ve described is not characteristic of an anxiety disorder. It’s more characteristic of PMS. This is especially true when you described having random sexual arousal. It’s common to have an increase in libido near or during your menstrual cycle. Again, this is often related to hormonal changes. One theory is that because there’s an increase in blood flow and lubrication during the menstrual cycle this heightens sexual arousal.As I mentioned before it might be helpful if you began a journal to document your thoughts and feelings. You may find that your emotions are in fact not random and occur right before or during your menstrual cycle. The likely explanation therefore would be PMS. If your random emotions continue to be a concern for you, you may want to speak to your doctor about your symptoms. He or she may be able to prescribe a medication that could help you during these times. If the symptoms are severe enough some women choose to take birth control as a way to manage their mood. Some also take an antidepressant. I would not recommend either of these for you specifically because I have so few details about your problem, but meeting with a doctor to further explore your situation may be helpful. Thank you for your question. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been married three years ago. We(me & my wife) are from India and belong from different family backgrounds and economic status,she being the best out of the two.The problem started after my marriage when she started disliking my parents because of my mom. Somehow my mom’s behavior did not meet her expectations. She stopped talking to them and wanted me to do the same as well. [/INST]  You are right. For some reason, your wife is very insecure. Asking you to take sides and cutting off communication for real or imagined hurts is manipulative. Asking you to shout at people is asking you to be as immature as she is. She apparently doesn’t understand that she is creating exactly the situation she fears most: Her bahavior is making a gap between you that will be harder and harder to bridge. No one should ever be asked to choose between the people they love.I wonder why your wife feels so threatened by your relationship with your parents. Does she, perhaps, not have an equally close relationship with her own parents? Does she feel that she needs to compete for your love? Since you are from different backgrounds, is it possible that she misunderstands your family’s ways and thinks they are being rude to her when they are only being themselves? Or has something happened in her life that makes her feel so unloved that she needs all of your love and attention to feel like she is getting enough? Does she feel she married beneath her and therefore needs you to reject your family in order to be equal to her?Without more information, I’m afraid I can’t be very helpful. Perhaps you can take a big step back from the situation and analyze what motivates her to be this way. If you can understand her pain, you’ll be able to be more compassionate and you’ll be better able to address her needs. Instead of arguing with her, keep asking her, in the most loving way you can, why she doubts your love. Reassure her you have plenty of love to go around; that loving your family doesn’t diminish your ability to love her.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I cannot hold down a job because I refuse to submit to arbitrary authority. I’ve been diagnosed with BPD as well. I continuously get fired or quit due to workplace conflicts. I’m trying to move to a region of the country where employment opportunities may be more varied, pertain to my career field, or pay more; however, my inability to work is making this goal nearly impossible to achieve. I simply cannot work. No amount or type of coping skill makes the pain of submission to authority or workplace bullying any less excruciating. [/INST] It’s not clear what you mean by “submission to authority” or “arbitrary authority.” I wish that I had more details about the circumstances of your firings and decisions to quit. It could be that the people in “authority” are bosses (or managers). These individuals always have more power than employees. Their job is to oversee and manage those employees. The hierarchy is such that the boss naturally has more power than do the individuals working under them. They are in a position of telling others what to do. These are, of course, general statements about the power dynamics between bosses and their employees and certainly would not apply to everyone, in every situation.The boss also provides guidance and leadership to employees. Many have earned their place in the company. They often acquired their higher-level status after having worked many years with the company. Employees, especially new employees, look to them for advice. Employees often haven’t been at the company as long as the boss and thus rely on their advice.Sometimes, people can be resentful of the boss. This is especially true when the boss is unfair, bullies their employees or creates a toxic work environment. It’s not clear if any of those situations where applicable to you or if you simply resent being told what to do, under any circumstances.If you cannot work because of this issue, then you have a dilemma. You will have severely limited your job prospects. That significantly narrows the scope of options you have for work or a career. This hurts your ability to make a living. It is you who will suffer from your inability to work with others. You have the potential to lose out on great jobs and a satisfying career. You also face a significant loss of potential income. One needs to work in order to have money to pay bills, to eat, to have a home, and so forth. You need money to live.In addition, if you live in the United States, you need to have health insurance. Without health insurance, you face serious financial and medical consequences. Those without health insurance often forgo preventative care and risk not being able to pay their medical bills, should they get sick and need treatment. Medical care can be extraordinarily expensive. Recent studies indicate that the majority of bankruptcies in the United States are linked to medical issues. Often, health insurance comes from the employer and without this benefit, many simply cannot afford health insurance.People can also gain satisfaction and a feeling of accomplishment from their jobs. This is not to say that a person’s self worth should be tied to their careers or what they do for a living but it can positively affect their confidence levels. Competence increases one’s self-esteem. Without those occupational elements in your life, you may suffer from a lack of competence, confidence and or self-esteem.If you can’t function in the traditional work environment, then you’ll need to find another way to make a living. One potential option is to be your own boss. Perhaps you can start your own business. That’s one potential workaround.You mentioned that you have BPD but I’m not certain if you meant borderline personality disorder or bipolar disorder. In any event, one strategy for attempting to resolve this problem is counseling. You might consider it to adjust or realign your mindset around these issues. Your inability to be deferential to authority hurts your job prospects and thus potentially your ability to have a happy and well-adjusted life. If you are open to it, counseling could remedy this. Good luck and please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  I’m 15. Recently, I feel like my life has been out of my control. My academics are so stressful and I don’t feel rewarded for working twice as hard as some people. Also, I have never been the most popular, which is fine with me, but one of my friends has stopped sitting with me at lunch, and including me in events with her ‘new friends’. She acts normal and nice when we talk in art, but I don’t understand! Today she brought in cookies and had to give them to some people because they were asking. Then she said “I baked this last night to give to my friends and everyone ate them!” and she didn’t give me one. I was a little rude to her last year because she got to close to me. Is she trying to have revenge? I don’t know what I did wrong! I have been very nice this whole year. I think that’s what is troubling me the most. Not understanding why I am losing someone who was close to me. I have lost 5 best friends in the past because they moved, am I going to lose her? Will dealing with her ever get easier if she doesn’t come back? [/INST]  I don’t think your friend is exacting revenge. I think she’s torn between her long-standing relationship with you and the excitement of being chosen by some of the popular kids. She’s letting herself get swept along instead of making up her own mind and taking a stand. It’s not an unusual situation. But that doesn’t make it any less painful for you.I don’t know if the cookie friend will have the strength to stand by you when she is being courted by the new group. I do think it’s worth trying to talk to her about it – if you can do it without accusing and blaming. It’s more likely to be a successful talk if you tell her you are confused and you miss her.Meanwhile, I encourage you to join something at school that interests you. You need to increase the pool of people you know who are interested in the same things you are. Try out for a play. Join a club. Volunteer at something that other kids volunteer for. (Many kids in my town volunteer at the local animal shelter, for instance.) Write for the school paper. It doesn’t matter what it is as long as you are genuinely interested and there are more than a few other people around your age doing it. Then jump into the activity with a smile. Don’t try too hard. Friends naturally develop out of this kind of situation. Give it time and a real effort and things will probably work out.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My friend has been trying to tell my family that I cut. She cuts too and sees a therapist. She will not stop telling me to do something about it when I don’t want to tell anyone. I’m not the type of person to share feelings with my parents, and I never have been. It’s been about 5 months that I have cut myself and I often think about not eating because I think I’m fat. I have a very stress-filled life with my dad making my week filled with everything. Lessons, journalism, you name it. My friend has been diagnosed with depression, being bipolar, and some others. I hate it, she can get very angry if I don’t do something, I don’t want to, like skip class with her, or lie to my parents. She causes some of the stress that makes me want to cut. I don’t do it as often as I used to, but it’s been over 50 times in the last 3 months. I’m very stressed because I have a ton more homework now that I just started high school and I have mental breakdowns a lot more now. But the thing is, I will be normal at school and nobody knows except for the friends I have told, and I sill laugh and smile, but one little thing said to me can ruin my whole day and end up in a night of crying and cutting. I have become more moody lately and more negative, and nobody will let me forget it. I don’t want to seem like the kind of 14 year old who’s like “I’m sooooooo depressed omg, I cut myself because my mom wouldn’t get me an iPhone 6, fml” — hell no. I’m afraid to talk to anyone and probably won’t, and I just physically can’t say it, and my friend doesn’t seem to understand that.

"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: My daughter, who is 14, informed me that over the course of about a year, my 16 year old son has touched her while she’s sleeping. According to my daughter, this has happened about 4 times. I asked as many questions as I could think of; the information I gathered is that it was mostly her breasts, my daughter didn’t stop him, she continued to pretend to be asleep, he doesn’t know she knows; she has begged me to not say anything to him or anyone else. I am at a loss. I don’t know what to do. I now have her sleeping in my room to make sure she’s safe. She said she feels safe, but I’m unbelievably concerned. I want to help my daughter through this, but clearly my son needs help as well. I don’t know how to approach this; get them both the help they need. [/INST]  Of course you are concerned! Of course you are at a loss. No parent is prepared for something like this. I’m so glad you wrote.First: Some secrets shouldn’t be kept. You are right that both kids are troubled. Your daughter may feel safer now that she is sleeping in your room, but that doesn’t make the impact of the situation go away. My guess is that she is upset with herself for not telling you right away and upset with her brother for violating her trust.Your daughter needs to be told that pretending to sleep when she was being assaulted is a normal response. She didn’t know what to do. Why would she? So she just froze. It’s what kids in such a situation often do. That is not something to feel guilty about.She shouldn’t feel guilty about telling you either. The most caring thing she could do for the entire family was to tell. Please — tell her that you are going to talk with her brother and get to the bottom of what this is about. Denial of the situation won’t guarantee that it will stop nor will it get him the help he needs.Then talk to your son. Don’t put it off. Approach it with as much compassion as you can muster despite your justifiable anger. He already knows that what he did was unacceptable. Unless he is mentally ill, he feels guilty about it. He knows he needs help. One thing to ask him is if someone has sexually hurt him. Often kids who abuse other kids are acting out something that happened to them.Ever since you moved her to your room, everyone in the family must know that something is up. It won’t surprise either of the kids that you looked for advice here or that you will insist that everyone get into some therapy.Find a therapist who specializes in adolescents and sexual abuse. The therapist will do an evaluation and will give you guidance about what to do next. Please don’t try to go it alone. You need support as well as practical help so that you can help both of your kids — and deal constructively with your own shock and distress about the situation.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I often Google such terms as “world’s best mother” and “loving mom.” It has almost become a habit of mine: turn on the laptop, open Internet Explorer, type in the usual queries . . . and have a box of tissues handy. [/INST]  Your mother has given you a miserable childhood but it’s up to you whether you let that ruin your life. Not everyone gets the mother they deserve. When you were little, the lack of a loving mother felt desperate. But you’re 14 now. You are no longer dependent on your mother. She can no longer push you around physically. Your dad has given you another place to go. Most important, you are lucky to have your stepmother in your life.Stepmom is the counter-model to your biological mother. If you let her, she can give you the nurturance and guidance that your own mother can’t. Instead of torturing yourself with goggle-searches, why not put your energy into making the best possible relationship with stepmom? It won’t be perfect. It can’t be. It doesn’t have to be. All she needs to be is a “good enough” mom and you have what most people have.If your bio-mom heals and comes around someday, you can include her in your life as well if you like. Just don’t deprive yourself of an alternative “mother” in the meantime. Working out a relationship with a woman you see as normal is your best insurance that you won’t grow into being an abusive person as you fear. It will also give you the experience you need to relate to others who have a more “normal” mother-son relationship.You are a smart and sensitive guy who thinks about things that most 14 year olds don’t think about. If you do your part to make a functional family with your dad and stopmom, you’ll be okay.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Raised by my mother, so she was obviously always working trying to support us. There are only a few memories I have of her and none of them are pleasant. She was mean, verbally abusive and on occasion physically abusive. She always had a boyfriend around, some were abusive as well. I was exposed to a lot of sexual activity through them or on television, I was molested by her bfs daughter (I was 7 she was 13). I was constantly alone. I always watched them fight and yell. I never felt loved by her. We never hug, kiss or say I love you. I hated her for years, and now I’m just indifferent. It makes me squirm to think about her, or to get to know her, to hear about other really good mom and daughter relationships. The thought of hugging her gives me anxiety. I don’t like the sound of her voice and now when she says I love you, I hate it. I can barely stand to be around her for only a little while. [/INST]  Sadly, not every person gets a mother who knows how to be a mom. Yours clearly didn’t know how to protect you or love you as she should. Apparently the best she could do was to keep a roof over your head and provide for you. That’s not nothing, but it wasn’t enough. It has left you with an emotional hole you are trying to fill.But — you have been lucky enough to have alternate mothers. Your grandmother and your friend’s mom can fill the emotional needs your mother can’t handle. In psychology, we call such people “benevolent witnesses.” They are people who provide a positive experience of a loving relationship when a parent can’t or won’t do it. They become the source of loving interest and care in the present and a beacon for how to be a good parent in the future. You have not one, but two such women in your life. This is a gift!I’m not sure you’ll ever be able to love your mom. You may be able to figure out what made it so hard for her to be a better mother. You may be able to forgive her for not doing better. You may be able to thank her for what she was able to do in spite of her own challenges. Your compassion and appreciation are the kind of love you can give her honestly.Meanwhile, you don’t have to look far for the kind of motherly love or mother-daughter relationship you seek. You already have them in your grandmother and your friend’s mom.I think therapy could help you feel okay about the limits of your relationship to your biological mother and would help you embrace the mothering that is available to you.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have aspergers syndrome and I have never been in a relationship before. I’ve been turned down by nearly every girl I’ve asked out even though I’ve been trying to get a girlfriend for seven years now. I met one person at my college a couple of years ago that I really connected with and still deeply care for, to the point where last night I even dreamed about her, and of course in the dream she rejected me again. Even though it has been nearly a year since then and her and I have remained good friends, it has still been eating away at me since then. I did attempt to find another relationship, one girl asked me out but it didn’t even make it to a first date because she was so over the top dramatic she literally induced a stress related illness in me. (which I found out later she does to everyone she asks out) Since then I’ve been feeling progressively more hopeless and I’m honestly doubting whether I’ll ever find someone I’m compatible with. [/INST]  Of course an Aspie can find love. I know many who have romantic partners and many who are married and have children. There really is someone for everyone out there. It just takes some patience to find them.You are only 20. Contrary to what you see on TV and the movies, it is not at all unusual for someone not to have had a relationship by then. Please relax. You have plenty of time.Part of your problem is that you are too focused on “getting” a girlfriend. It rarely happens that way. The most stable love relationships are those that evolve naturally out of a friendship. Slow down. Instead of pursuing love, pursue friendships. That means joining some activity where there are both men and women who enjoy the same things you do. Colleges are full of service organizations, clubs, political causes, and activities where people get together to share experiences, develop their talents and find friends who share their interests. When people are focused on staging an event, doing a project, or building a team to accomplish a task, there are lots of opportunities to talk and get to know each other without the pressure of dating. Over time, some of those relationships blossom into romance.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Recently, I have been imagining and having visions of people being killed. I have had multiple dreams where people have been killed, mostly stabbed, in all of which I have killed them. Murder has never appealed to me until quite recently and I find this very weird. I frequently have visions of random people being killed in some way and sometimes, if I’m stood in a large crowd and am feeling particularly anxious I see multiple people being murdered around me. It doesn’t scare me or disturb me, in fact it comforts me, strangely. My friends aren’t scared of me but I am scared of myself, especially since I sometimes have sudden urges to kill someone when they do something as small as call me a name. I often feel like I have no control over my actions and I do things without thinking. I am worried that I am going to do something bad at some point and I feel as if I have no control over what I might do. I would really appreciate some advice. Thank you. [/INST] The most concerning aspect of your letter is that you feel you have no control over your behavior. If you cannot control yourself, then others may be at risk of harm. In that case, you must seek help. That would be the right course of action.Counseling could help to uncover the cause of your unusual thoughts but most importantly it would help by teaching you how to control your behavior. Thoughts are not necessarily something that one can control. Behavior, alternatively, is generally within one’s control. Inability to control one’s behavior is a sign that something is wrong. It might indicate a mental illness. If a mental illness is present, treatment is necessary.Ask your parents to take you to a counselor. You don’t necessarily have to tell them every detail about why you want to go. It may be enough to say that you want help with emotional issues. Hopefully that will spur your parents into action. If you feel that you might hurt yourself or someone else, contact emergency services. They will help you immediately and protect you and others from harm. Good luck and please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  Hello, I was hoping to get an expert’s opinion on this before I seek help. I think I may have clinical depression. I’m not going to get too much into my personal life since I’m supposed to keep this short.For years now, I’ve been feeling very down. Nothing has really excited me and in general I have a pretty negative outlook on life. I feel completely hopeless both in my current situation and while thinking about my future. I always thought it was just hormones and well teenage stuff. I’m nearing the end of my teens now and it hasn’t gone away. In fact, it’s gotten much worse. Lately, I’ve been having a lot of trouble focusing. I used to be able to write school papers in one sitting without too much of a problem. This last week I was supposed to write a one page autobiography and how it relates to my chosen career. I sat down for a good hour and a half and all I had down was three sentences. I have been having short term memory issues-at the end of the day I have trouble even recalling what I did for most of it. I’ve also found that I’ve become very irritable. The littlest things will really start to tick me off. Most of the time I’m melancholy. I don’t really find any joy or excitement for anything, not even what used to be my favorite things to do. There are moments that I want to just break down and cry for no discernible reason. I do have a few moments throughout the day where I feel extremely happy and excited but they go away after maybe a minute at the most. Over the years I’ve just been able to knuckle down and muddle though the days but recently I’ve been having suicidal thoughts. They are nothing too serious as of yet, but they are a serious cause of concern. I’ve also been very fatigued. These days just walking up and down the stairs is taxing. Now, I do have breathing issues, but I really don’t think that’s all there is to it. I took the survey on this site and I scored a 58, severe depression. I have also been to several sites looking at the symptoms of depression. I have most if not all of the ones on every site I’ve been to. I’m writing this because I would like confirmation on what I have found out on my own. Also, I was wondering how I would go about seeking help. I would really like to avoid therapy if at all possible. I am very shy and reserved, I don’t think I would really be able to talk to the person much less enjoy it. If I were to go to a psychiatrist to get formally diagnosed, what would possible treatment options be? Also, I’m sorry that this is so long. I’m pretty sure it’s over 400 words. Thank you so much for your time and I look forward to a response. [/INST]  From the information that you have provided, depression seems like a realistic possibility. You have many of the signs; most serious among them are suicidal thoughts. Happy people don’t contemplate suicide. Suicidal thoughts should always be taken seriously. Undoubtedly, you should seek professional help.You stated that you want to avoid psychotherapy. It may not be what you want to do but psychotherapy is necessary to treat your condition.You should also consider medication. Millions of people have had success with antidepressant medication. Medication works best when the client is also in psychotherapy.Acquiring psychological services typically begins by visiting your primary care physician. Report your symptoms and ask for a referral to a mental health professional. Typically, you will either be referred to a psychologist or a clinical social worker for psychotherapy services. Your primary care physician may prescribe an antidepressant or suggest that you seek specialized services with a psychiatrist.Therapy is the perfect place to learn to overcome your shyness. Being reserved may be your description of an inability to open up to another. Being reserved and shy is not beneficial to you. It is problematic for almost all people who feel this way. Have you ever wished you weren’t that way? Without exception, every client of mine who has described themselves as you have would have answered that they wished they weren’t that way. That is was and has been a problem in their lives. Shyness is a fear. Generally, shy people have been hurt early in their lives, when they opened up to someone. They were ridiculed or made fun of. They may have been described as being “too sensitive.” Sensitivity, as we speak of it here, is a gift to poets, philosophers, writers and therapists. Being described as “insensitive” is an insult. You need to learn techniques and methods to deal with social interaction while fully maintaining your sensitivity. A good therapist can teach you exactly what you need to learn.Please search my earlier posts for my advice on how to find a good therapist.Little things, over time, can add up to full-blown depression. Thank you for writing and from one sensitive person to another, know that I am rooting for you.If you have any additional questions, please don’t hesitate to write again. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been diagnosed with Aspergers and Major Depression, however I am not sure these diagnoses are correct as hypnogogic hallucinations continue and frankly, even after two different types of antidepressants, my depression is only marginally better. [/INST]  Hypnagogic hallucinations could be indicative of a sleep disorder. Anxiety and depression could also be making the hallucinations worse, but not treating a possible underlying sleep disorder could be at the heart of the problem.Sometimes medication alone isn’t enough. You could benefit from counseling. It is a recommended treatment for both depression and anxiety. It could help to regulate your sleep which could, in turn, decrease your hypnagogic hallucinations.Another possibility to consider is that you have yet to find the right medication. It can take time to find something that works. It is often a trial and error process.Your antidepressant medication could be negatively impacting your hypnagogic hallucinations. Consider discussing these possibilities with your prescribing physician.I would recommend consulting a sleep specialist about your hypnagogic hallucinations. Ask your prescribing physician for a referral to a sleep specialist in your community. You might need to undergo a sleep study, to determine if a sleep disorder is present.

I let people say what they want about me. i feel very scared of being misjudged.. And that’s what happens sometimes.. or may be all the time.. I don’t know how to stop worrying and get back my confidence.. [/INST]  The feelings you describe often go with social anxiety disorder. People with this disorder are anxious about being with people because they have an irrational fear that they are being constantly judged by others. In your case, you avoid people you don’t know and stave off your worries about people you do know by being overly responsive and self-sacrificing. It’s as if you don’t trust that your friends like you for who you are, not just for everything you can do for them. It’s very painful.The good news is that cognitive behavior therapy has been found to be especially effective in helping people get more comfortable with the social world. Generally, such therapy is short term, lasting only 3 – 4 months of weekly sessions. Analytic type therapies, on the other hand, are often not helpful because they tend to set off even more obsessive thinking.I encourage you to find a cognitive-behavioral therapist to help you get past these feelings so you can be relaxed with people. If you can’t do that, there are self-help books on the subject. I was also able to locate several online support groups for people who experience social phobia by doing a simple search on the Internet.You seem like a very nice person. I hope you will follow through and get some kind of treatment so that you can have more fun and be less stressed when you are around others.I wish you well.  </s>"

It’s good that he can help but he can’t be there all the time. As you noted, he works and you are often left to care for your child alone.In addition to having a new baby and hearing “ugly” voices, you have severe anxiety. It’s so bad that you do not want to leave your home. You need help.It’s particularly important that you treat these problems because of your new baby. Your baby needs you, as his or her primary caregiver, to be emotional stable. If you’re anxious and afraid, so too might your baby.Don’t wait for these problems to go away on their own. Seek professional help. Mental health professionals receive specific training to deal with the very problems with which you are struggling. People can get better with therapy and medication and so can you.Ask the social worker for a referral to mental health treatment. Child protective services is much more likely to let you keep your baby if you are proactively seeking help. Some people might not think so but child protective service workers, want to keep families together. Sometimes they have to take the children away from their parents in order to protect them but their goal is always reunification. Proactively seeking mental health treatment significantly increases the likelihood of keeping your family together. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been married for 23 years. My husband used to be more affectionate but it has waned over the years. It is however, not completely gone. He will hold me at night as he falls asleep, kiss me upon arriving home and we are still regularly physically intimate. Although I’ve had to guide him throughout the years, he is supportive and kind despite being a bit distant and unexcitable. I know that most women would be fairly happy with this situation but for some reason, I have moments where I feel he could be more affectionate and romantically focused. He is an excellent provider and we have a beautiful home, nice kids and a blessed life. What on earth is my problem then? [/INST]  You are absolutely right: This is what is called an intergenerational transmission of a problem. Children do learn what they live. You grew up taking in your mother’s unhappiness with your dad as well as her belief that he wasn’t doing a good enough job loving her.Your problem isn’t your husband. Your problem isn’t low self-esteem. Your problem is that you haven’t been able to free yourself from that early teaching. You are very right to be scared that you will end up lonely and alienated just as she was. I hope that gives you the motivation to do something about it.You are fortunate, indeed, that you learned from your father as well as your mother. You looked for and found a decent guy who is steadfast, who loves you and who has made a good life with you.The something you can do is some serious therapy. Therapy can help us correct early teaching. In your case, it can also help you truly appreciate all that you have.Apparently your negative feelings have been building for years. That tells me that if you could fix this on your own, you would have done it already. I therefore encourage you to seek out a therapist and to do that corrective work. You are right that most women would be very happy with the marriage you are tempted to throw away. Since the problem lies within you, not within the man or the marriage, I doubt very much that you will find anything better.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have gone through the symptoms of Paranoid Personality disorder and my wife seems to be suffering from the same since last 13 years. she is 39 years old and is a house wife now. earlier she was working as a teacher. she is a mother of 3 kids. My questions is that how should family members behave with a patient of paranoid personality disorder and how can we save our children from being a victim of the same disease. what are the chances of getting them affected. My wife doesn’t trust anyone in my family and fights with everyone. she says that she is not suffering from any disease and thinks that i want to divorce her on this ground. [/INST]  I want to caution you against diagnosing your wife with a mental illness. She may have paranoid personality disorder, but she would need a comprehensive evaluation to determine if she has a psychological condition. Mental health professionals receive years of rigorous training to make determinations about mental health diagnoses and thus have the necessary expertise. It’s always best to consult an expert, when possible.Generally speaking, having a parent with a mental illness increases the probability of their offspring having a mental illness, but there is no easy way to determine the likelihood of that outcome. Both nature and nurture are thought to contribute to the development of mental health disorders but researchers cannot yet pinpoint the exact cause of any one mental health disorder. Your children would benefit from living in a supportive, loving environment which could help to buffer any additional stress.It’s common for people with psychotic disorders to not recognize that they are ill. The inability to recognize one’s illness is a symptom of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. Therefore, it often takes a great deal of effort to convince a family member who is actively psychotic that they need help. The best treatment for psychosis is medication. Medication will reduce the symptoms. The sooner you can get her into treatment, the better her prognosis.Your first step should be having her evaluated by a mental health professional. That will provide more clarity about what’s wrong and most importantly, how to treat her symptoms. Once her symptoms are under control, they will have less impact on your family.You might also consider family therapy to help your children deal with her symptoms. Family therapy is the ideal counseling method for family members who may be having difficulties adjusting to a family member suffering from mental health issues. Good luck. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello. I went for a day at the spa with my sisters and everything was going great. Then I went for my massage that my sister had already booked for me, it was a nice gift from her. Then I realized that it was a man who was giving the massage. I usually prefer women but no one else was available and I thought < >. I asked for a strong massage of neck and back. At first he said: I wont go that strong because I don’t want to hurt your muscles… So I thought OK, it will still be a massage and I am very stressed these days. Then he started talking to me non stop. About how my last name was special, how I was special… That I was so beautiful from the outside but also from the inside. Like he knew me. Like I was a witch able of good magic, that I had so much potential for my future. I didn’t know how to react, what he was saying was funny and they were good compliments but I was feeling uncomfortable. I was here to relax and was trying to make the most of it. I didn’t know how to react, I was just breathing hoping he would stop. His massage was nothing I asked for. He was stretching my body and not massaging. He was ”creating points of energy” and it wasn’t that relaxing. At some point he kinda touched me near my pectorals, but it felt weird, like he was too close to my breast, so I kinda moved a bit and he never went back there. At some other point he touched me near my coccyx, for my it was too far inside my bum, but also only for a sec and didn’t go back. I was so shy I didm’t say anything. It’s like I completely froze, almost naked there, I didn’t feel comfortable with him. Although nothing ‘happened’ I mean he didn’t touch directly my breast or my butt. He was going on and on about how he felt he knew me for a long time and I didn’t know what to answer, I was just expecting to have a relaxing time and it was just stressing me so much I froze and didn’t know what to do… It’s that way of touching mixed with what he was saying, asking if someone broke my heart, if I had a lot of sadness inside of me… etc etc… I came here to RELAX not for a therapy. But his questions were so surprising, unexpected in that context that still: It brought emotions in me (memories, sadness) that I couldn’t express myself. I am really depressed these days, with no energy… [/INST]  Thank you for your letter. What an uncomfortable series of events! I think there are two things that might help. First, the massage therapist was completely out of line. You told him what you wanted and he ignored it, and then he talked to you inappropriately through the entire session. Both things are not okay. You have to remember this is a service that you’re paying for. Instead of being relaxed he made you more anxious. He didn’t do his job properly.I would sit down and write a letter back to the spa. You have the bulk of it written here already — but in essence you want to explain that there were many elements of this massage that weren’t good.The writing of the letter is the intervention. Whether or not you send it is up to you and whether or not you send it with your name on it — or anonymously — is up to you. The idea is to express to them how inappropriate this was. The expressive writing alone will help.Secondly, I would have a discussion with your boyfriend about how hurtful it was to feel blamed by him. In criticizing you for not speaking up rather than helping you find ways to cope and speak up — he is doing the same thing to you that the massage therapist has done. In both instances you needed and expected one thing and got another. Your boyfriend needs to be taught how to listen and support you — not be judgmental and blaming.Finally, I would encourage you to read a book or take a brief course on assertiveness. These are rather easy skills and can help when you need to speak up and take care of yourself.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Approximately 6 years ago, I started to believe in God. I am very studious, so please don’t consider me an average believer. Anyhow God bestowed upon me success in the form of health, reputation and education. I disobeyed Him and He took it all back, also He made my life very fragile in numerous ways. One of the worst punishment He gave me was that He stopped my growth. Now before you think “It’s all in the genes” well it’s not, my parents have an average height and according to my doctor I should have been average too but sadly I stopped growing without any explanation. Now to my real problem, I have a self esteem issue in which when walking  on the streets I feel tiny (especially in front of women). This is deemed normal for people like me. Mentally speaking, I feel worthless and feel extraordinarily detached from this world (I see the world from space!). My social skills are deteriorating day by day. I used to be an excellent man once but now I am nothing! [/INST]  While there are several ways to discuss you concerns from a psychological perspective, I am going to view this as a spiritual rather than psychological crisis. It is important to make this distinction because the approach to correcting it is different.You have identified your age as 20, and that means that the issues that caused you to feel shift with God happened when you were 14. Whatever the transgression was that you feel God is punishing you for by stunting your growth happened as a teenager. You are now an adult and I would seek religious counsel that can help you find a way to ask for God’s compassion in helping you restore your connection with Him.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Sometimes I have this very strong sense of needing to be in a certain place; it’s like nostalgia, except the place doesn’t exist. [/INST]  You have only written a few short paragraphs but based on that limited amount of information, nothing that you have written would normally be associated with a mental illness. You are basically describing experiencing a very short memory.Some people have no memories whatsoever of their dreams. Most people however can remember some dreams, sometimes. Those who remember their dreams, even partially, will tell you that their dreams often occur in places that they have never been to in real life and include people that they do not know in real life.They, like you, remember people and places that they have experienced only in their dreams. These memories are not illusions nor delusions, simply because they are not based on every day, real-world experiences. They are memories and valid as such.We all, roughly, spend one third of our lives sleeping and dreaming. This is a significant portion of our entire life. The importance of dreaming has been well-established in scientific research. Allowing someone to sleep but awakening them when they begin to dream and thus depriving them of dreamtime, will eventually lead to their dreaming with their eyes wide open and thus dreaming while awake or conscious. When deprived of dreamtime people become unstable, emotional and sometimes violent.It is not my place to interpret or to conclude the meaning of sleep research. However, it is very safe to say that dreaming is very important, though not well understood. You have not confused real life memories from non-real-life memories. If you had done so or were to do so, this thinking would fit the more standard definitions of illusions and delusions. If, this simple answer to your question, ends your panic and crying, then all should be well. If the knowledge that I have provided, does not end your panic attacks then you should consult a mental health professional. Dreams can be experientially, as real as life. You dream with all five senses just as you experience life with all five senses.Memories of non-real-world things, are not a problem since they could be no more than memories of experiences in your dreams. Having panic attacks, for whatever reason, is never desirable or acceptable. If the panic attacks continue, you must see a qualified therapist. If the small amount of information that I have provided you is sufficient to end the unpleasantness that arises from your memory of this place, then all should be well. Good luck. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Australia: I’ve had trouble making friends for a long time. At 53, people are simply too busy to admit new people into their lives. And my partner doesn’t want to come out out socialise with me and build a community together, so I get hassled a lot about why he doesn’t come with me. Then as there’s not many people to go out with. I don’t do as much and feel that compounds the situations as I didn’t have as many activities to talk about and thus feel I come across as boring. [/INST]  I hesitate to support a diagnosis of social anxiety. It sounds to me like you are discouraged.You are certainly not alone in your situation. The older we get, the harder it can seem to make new friends. People do have established circles of friends. Those with adult children are often wrapped up with the grandkids. It’s not likely that you will meet new people as you once did through your job or through your children. Complicating things further is that you have a partner who is happy with you as his only real friend.But please don’t give up. You can find new and interesting people to spend time with. The solution is to find an activity that you feel passionate about. It could be a political issue, a charity, a sport, a theater group or bird-watching — as only a few examples. It doesn’t matter as long as it is an activity that attracts other passionate people.Get involved. Focus on making a contribution. By working together, you will get to know other people who share your interests. Putting your energy into making a difference takes the pressure off the longing for friends. And — you know what? — Friendships get made that way.Please don’t let your partner’s contentment with staying home stop you from going out. If anyone is tactless enough to hassle you, simply tell them that “oh, he’s a homebody” and change the subject. You are not required to be attached to him with velcro. If you are comfortable with yourself, other people will let it go.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Let me start by saying I love my fiancé. He’s my best friend and partner. We’ve been together for 3 and half years and recently got engaged. His mom has always been overbearing (he’s an only child to a single mom) and until recently his dad was not in the picture. However, his Dad, due to legal issues had to come back to where we live so he could continue to receive food stamps and benefits. Having quickly settled his legal issues, his Dad has recently discovered that he wants to build a relationship with my Fiancé after over 20 years a part. During his life his Dad is abandoned 3 kids, used drugs heavily and has practically lived off handouts from different people and family members. I’m having a really hard time swallowing that he genuinely wants to build a relationship with my Fiancé and it’s looking for something monetary. [/INST]  It is a great thing that his father is in recovery and wanting to reach out. However, the course of reconnecting does involve you. I would make a point to your fiancé that you want to be part of this. The father isn’t just developing a relationship with his son, he’s reconnecting to his son’s life and that includes you.You are with this man for three years, and you obviously love him. If you were to leave now and the father bales in a month – what does that say about your relationship?It sounds like the primary concern is that the father may be doing this in a manipulative way. That is very understandable and my strong suggestion is that whatever happens going forward goes slow. You want to be there for your fiancé so that we can talk about this process. And you want to be there to provide another view when it is necessary. I think if the relationship is going to flourish, then you need to talk about your concerns openly. Don’t be silent but don’t push your fiancé away. Remain skeptical. Your fiancé may be clouded by his father’s desire to connect and you can be there for support as well as be the voice of reasonWishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have a 15 year old brother who looks up to me. He claims to be scared of the dark. Usually after watching a scary movie he would ask me to sleep in his room. Last year in the middle of the night, I felt something near my private part and it was my younger brother trying to touch me but i noticed that was “sleeping” so I assumed that he was having a “sexual dream”. I always had a feeling that my brother is gay but that doesn’t bother me. Then another night it happened again and he tried to touch me but this time i freaked out and slapped his hand and it seemed like he was “sleeping”. so once again I thought he was dreaming. Two nights ago in my room downstairs my a/c broke so I went to sleep in my little brothers room again. In the middle of the night I felt him trying to aim for my pants and I turned around and he quickly “pretended” to go back to sleep but this time I was very sure that he was awake. Last night I slept over again since I couldnt take the heat but this time I was so freaked out that I slept my stomach facing down. Around 4 am he kept trying and trying so i turned opposite side from him and he gave up turned around and started to masturbate. I was so freaked out I didnt know what to do somehow I forced myself to go back to sleep and oversleep so I wouldnt wake up to his face of how freaked out I was. Its been a whole and I just dont understand and i dont know how to confornt him at all. What does this mean? I think its weird for my younger brother to want to touch me? It doesnt make sense. [/INST]  Your brother has homosexual tendencies. Otherwise, he would not have been trying to touch you.After the first incident, you should not have placed yourself in a position where it could happen again. You put yourself in danger. Even though it was he who was touching you, as the adult in this situation, you could have been accused of child molestation. Please don’t misunderstand what I saying. I’m not accusing you of molesting your brother because clearly that is not the case but someone could have unfairly made that accusation.Going forward, you must never put yourself in a position where he can touch you. You should not be sleeping in his bed. If it’s necessary to sleep in his room, then sleep far away from him, alone and on the floor. Make it clear that he is not to leave his bed or you will leave the room. Also, talk to him about his masturbation. Tell him that you will not accept any sexual behavior on his part when you are present. You and he should never be sleeping in the same bed and only in a true emergency in the same room.You should also ensure that no one else sleeps in his bed. Since he has attempted to touch you, it’s reasonable to believe that he may try to do it to others. Young children, especially, are at risk.If you choose to confront your brother, you may want to do so with the assistance of a family therapist. It’s a very sensitive issue that may require professional help. You may want to contact a therapist and speak with him or her about the situation. After gathering more information about your family, they could advise you about how to address this situation. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Last year I wanted to see how would it feel like to cut. I remember I got very upset about something. It made me feel like i hated myself. So I cut my self on the wrist, but I was scared, so I did it gently but it didn’t satisfy me and I felt like I wasn’t even strong enough to do anything. It made me feel weak.So every time I cut I try to do it deeper and deeper. But it doesn’t hurt at all. It makes the pain inside go away. This year I did it the most. I usually cut on my stomach which is the area where most people wont notes it. The first time i did it it made me scared. I felt like a total loser why would I ever do that?? i asked myself. So i decided to never do it again. It scared me. But with more things happening this year i wasn’t able to control my emotions at all. The only way that i could let them out is through cutting. I usually do it when i feel that i am worthless, ugly and not worthy to live. Or if i get into a fight with a close person. I haven’t told no one because i know they will say i am stupid for doing it.But I cant stop. it seems like the only way out. This year I felt very depressed. I don’t know why mostly i was very depressed because of myself. I hate myself. I feel like i am harming every ones life. I don’t deserve happiness in this world.This year my step dad lost his job. My mom lost a baby. My cat got hit by a car.I was almost diagnosed with lupus. My mom always tells me i am ungrateful and don’t deserve anything. That really made me feel worse. I get into fights with my mom a lot. I don’t want to tell her she will get disappointed and even maybe yell at me telling me i am so stupid. I don’t really know what she would say. But i hate my self for doing it. I ruin my own life and the life of others. I just cant stop. [/INST]  I think I may understand why you are cutting. A large part of it likely stems from the fact that fundamentally you are having feelings of worthlessness. I do not think it is a coincidence that you cut when you are having very negative thoughts about yourself.Another reason you may cut is because you believe that you deserve to suffer. You did write that you “hate yourself” and that you “ruin the life of others.” It also seems like you don’t know other ways to deal with your emotions. That may be another reason why you cut.Some individuals who cut say they do it because they can’t feel, almost as though they are emotionally numb. They are disassociated from their emotions (i.e. feel nothing) and the only way to feel anything is to cut themselves. When they do cut they feel pain and feeling something is better than feeling nothing. They describe it as a release.Perhaps the aforementioned reasons explain why you harm yourself but more importantly is how to stop this behavior. You say that you can’t stop but please know that you can. I have known many adolescents who were eventually able to stop. Usually they stopped when they came to believe that they don’t deserve it and were taught alternative ways to deal with their emotions.It is also important to understand that you do not deserve to suffer. As I discussed above, part of why you self-harm may be connected to your belief that you deserve punishment. You don’t deserve it. That is the type of thinking that allows you to hurt yourself and it has to change. I believe that if you were able to enter counseling you would learn to change your thinking and eventually your behavior.You also should know that there are better ways to deal with your emotions. I would recommend that you make it a point to speak to someone when you are feeling upset. You said that your mother would be upset if she learned that you were cutting. You don’t necessarily have to tell her that you were cutting but you could go to her and have a discussion about what’s bothering you. If not your mother, then go to a friend, a mentor, a school counselor or someone you trust. You need to reach out for help.Asking for advice and talking about what’s bothering you are two ways to deal with this problem. You may also want to consider keeping a journal. Writing about your feelings may be a healthy outlet and could serve to defuse your strong emotions. You may be less likely to cut yourself. Other ideas include exercise, engaging in stretching or relaxation exercises, taking a yoga class, and so forth. Those are also ways to defuse your emotions.The ideas listed above may be beneficial to you but I would strongly suggest counseling. I recognize that when someone is cutting they are suffering tremendously. It is a sign that the individual needs help. Cutting is dangerous and you could accidentally harm yourself more than you intended. That is why it is important to consider counseling.I am encouraged that you wrote a letter about how you’re feeling. The next step is to ask your parents if they will take you to a therapist. I believe it is the best way to handle this situation. Counselors are trained to deal with the issues that you are facing. If you don’t want to ask your parents then go to the school counselor and he or she can help you either within the school or refer you to an outpatient therapist. Thank you for your question and I hope that you’re able to find help. Please write back if you have any additional questions. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I’ve started dating someone recently and I’ve realized that we are fairly bad at it since we can’t really seem to get into very personal topics. We met through a mutual friend almost a year ago, starting chatting on social media a few months ago and texting. Even though in the beginning personal topics were discussed, we’ve talked mostly about non-personal stuff, which I was okay with since I wanted to save them for face to face discussions. Last time we were out by ourselves, nothing happened, it just left me with a strange feeling. Also I’m now leaving it up to him to propose going somewhere, will see if it happens. Next time we have the opportunity to talk, what questions should I ask or what should I talk about? How do we get into personal conversation and avoid or at least reduce irrelevant garbage? Thank you. [/INST]  Thank you for writing. What you are calling “irrelevant” talk is often a way that people start to get to know each other. Although you did some chatting on line, you and this guy are now getting to know each other up close and personal. It’s not at all unusual for people in the early stages of relationships to stick to conversations about the weather, sports and current events.As they get more comfortable, they start to ask follow-up questions that move into more personal matters. For example: When talking about sports, they might ask when the other person first got involved with the sport, whether they played on any team as a kid or what makes the person so excited about it. The answers to such questions can segue into childhood memories, information about friends, and more information about what the person enjoys and why.If you are interested in this guy, I don’t understand why you are leaving it up to him to make the next move. You can make the opportunity to talk by suggesting an activity that lends itself to conversation. Go on a hike or walk or just to go for coffee. Then take the initiative to gently move the conversation to things that are a bit more personal. People generally do like to talk about themselves. If you ask a few questions that show genuine interest in his life, chances are he will respond positively. If he doesn’t, that may give you the information you need to decide if you want to continue to pursue the relationship.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, I am concerned about my health. I feel like I have a superiority complex and that I am above people which can seem odd or laughable in conversations. I have not been diagnosed, however I feel I may have a personality disorder and some mild psychosis. [/INST]  You seem to have a strong desire for attention. Generally speaking, people want to be noticed and they want to feel important. Sometimes that need is greater among people who didn’t sufficiently feel loved or valued by their primary caregivers. Perhaps that was lacking in your development and you behave in this manner in order to compensate for those unmet needs. There might be other explanations.The best way to determine what might be wrong and how to correct it is to be evaluated by a mental health professional. An evaluation will determine what treatment would be the most appropriate for your set of symptoms.You are attempting to connect with others but in a seemingly maladaptive way. A good example of this is your desiring the attention of someone who physically harmed you and who wanted nothing to do with you. You should not be accepting of that type of treatment from others. You should avoid unhealthy relationships but because of your strong desire for attention, you seem to be willing to tolerate them. Therapy can be helpful in teaching you how to appropriately interact with others and how to recognize signs of an unhealthy relationship. Learning these skills can significantly improve your relationships and your quality of life. Please take care. </s>"

Well my situation is that I develop feelings of affection for others very quickly and that is my problem but this time around I don’t think it is so. [/INST]  I understand why it is difficult to approach her. Good friendships can be hard to find and she has been a good friend to you so you don’t want to risk it. But, on the other hand, most things that matter require some degree of risk.You say she has been a good friend to you. Have you been a good friend to her as well? If not, that is the place to start. Make her life brighter and easier in any way you can. Help her believe in herself just as she has helped you. Be a positive presence in her life. My guess is that things should move naturally from there.If, however, you already have established a balanced relationship, it may be that each of you is waiting for the other to make the next move. You could tentatively and respectfully ask her if she would be open to seeing each other socially. Keep it light. Take it slow. Don’t start talking about “settling down” until you get a clear indication that she feels the same way you do.I hope your patience is rewarded.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My name is Ashley, I am 20 years old. Still very young and have a lot to learn, that is what brought me here. My boyfriend, Michael, is 27 years old, lives with his grandfather and just recently finished Cosmetology school. I have known him for almost a year, but we have only been dating for 7 months. In those 7 months we have spent almost all of our time together and have only had a few big fights. My parents found out about 2 months ago that Michael was on Methadone. He used to do Heroine and Opiate Pills. When I met him about a year ago he was at 40 mg of Methadone a day and now he is down to about 25 mg a day. In the time that I have known him he has never done Heroin that I am aware of and I trust that he hasn’t. However, he has taking a few Opiate Pills, which my parents are not aware of. The first time he took a pill while we were spending time together he got very mean and violent. The next morning, he didn’t remember a thing, but apologized and promised it would never happen again. And it hasn’t. When him and I first started dating he drank a lot and when I told him that it bothered me, he stopped. Now, he only drinks once or twice every two weeks. My parents believe he is going to ruin me life and turn me to drugs and other bad substances. I know myself and I trust that I would never do anything to put myself in harms way. I have made it very clear to Michael that if he ever goes back to Pills or Heroin that I will leave without giving him the opportunity to explain. He is working, and finishing up his last few exams at the Cosmetology school. He currently does not have a license due to the DUI he received about 6 months ago, but he has been going to classes to get an occupational license. He only has once class left before he receives that. For the most part I am truly happy with Michael. The only times I’m not is when he drinks which is not often. Like I said, once or twice every two weeks. He knows he messed up in his past and continues to make mistakes, but he claims he is trying. And I see him trying everyday, but my parent’s do not. They refuse to see him, speak with him. They have not spoke to him since they found out he was on Methadone. I am torn. I love my family, but I love Michael as well. When my parents found out about him taking Methadone and began pretending that he didn’t exist, I moved in with Michael and his grandfather. Recently, Michael and I have seriously been talking and looking into getting an apartment together. I’m not sure what to tell my parents. But him and I both are serious about making this work and having a life together. Him and I have been through so much bad things together in the last year that should have torn us apart, but instead just brought us closer together and made us stronger and I truly believe that it will all be worth it in the end, when it comes to the issues with my parents. He is a good man that made big mistakes, but is doing everything in his power to make his life right, now. I just wish my parents could see that. Am I making the right choice by choosing Michael and possibly losing my family? My parents are smart people, but I feel like if I don’t live my life the way I want to even though I might get hurt and I just walk away now because it is what my parents want, I will always wonder what could have been if I just continued to have faith in Michael, have faith in us that we would make it? I would always wonder what could have been. [/INST]  Thank you for asking this question. Your letter is very touching because it is so sincere. Your parents want the best for you and that is likely to be what is causing the trouble. Michael has a very long road of recovery in front of him, and I am glad he is off to a good start. Recovery from the kind of addiction he has is difficult and it is common for there to be achievements mixed with setbacks and disappointments. You letter speaks of these already. While taking methadone he has taken opiate pills, you say he has cut back, but hasn’t stopped drinking, and he is still struggling with the aftereffects of his DUI. In other words, Michael is far from being out of the woods.If you are serious that you want to stay with him, your love will not be enough and it will cause strife between you and your parents. If you want to be a partner to someone with an addiction you need to work very hard at not losing your family, your friends and yourself. Your love needs to be mixed with the wisdom of the millions of people who have come before you who have loved those with drinking and drug problems. I recommend you go to six Nar anon meetings or six Al-anon meetings in your area to learn more exactly what you are up against.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am having this problem and it is not a regular well I will put it off another day, Procrastination problem. I seriously cannot get anything done if it is on my own time. I face anxiety and get to where I am afraid of failing and seeing what the outcome will be no matter what. [/INST]  Laziness is not the problem. Nor is the “need to grow up.” This problem likely stems from your childhood experiences and interactions with your parents. You were raised to believe that you had to be perfect. This fear was instilled in you. The fear has stayed with you and it is degrading your life. It is clearly holding you back. It is keeping you from realizing your full potential.Keep in mind is that you are no longer a child. You don’t have to impress your parents. You don’t have to answer to them or be “perfect.” No one is perfect. The standards that you felt compelled to meet were unrealistic. No one could have met those standards.Understanding “why” you engage in certain behaviors is an interesting analytical exercise but it does little to assist you in correcting them. I would recommend psychotherapy. A psychotherapist could teach you more efficient behaviors. By your own admission, when it comes to almost every activity, you procrastinate. You may simply need to be taught a different way of doing things. Learning a new skill set could greatly assist you in breaking the cycle of procrastination.Psychotherapy can also help you learn new ways of thinking. Both you and your therapist could analyze your thought patterns to determine psychologically what is holding you back. Fear and anxiety are the symptoms but what thoughts underlie those feelings? What keeps the fear and anxiety alive? The goal of this process is to determine how logical or illogical your thought patterns are and to correct them accordingly.Analyzing and systematically correcting your behavior and thought patterns are the essence of cognitive behavioral therapy.If you are not interested in psychotherapy, then you may want to read self-help books. M. Scott Peck’s book The Road Less Traveled discusses issues such as anxiety, procrastination and the fear of living. You may want to check Psych Central’s book reviews for other recommendations. Others find cognitive behavioral and other related therapeutic workbooks very beneficial.In terms of finding support groups, I would encourage you to do a Google search for procrastination or anxiety support groups. Psych Central hosts anxiety forums that you may like. Check with the community mental health center or local psychotherapists to determine if anxiety support groups are available. I hope this helps. Please take care. </s>"

[/INST]  I am so sorry you have to deal with this difficulty with your wife. It can be one of the most frustrating things to watch the person you love experience radical changes in her life that affect you. Of course it is too difficult to know for sure, but it does sound like this should first be checked out by a physician. The radical nature and unpredictability of this lends itself to a medical review first and foremost. My strong suggestion is to ask her to go for an examination with her general practitioner and offer to go with her for support. Approaching this as a condition she is having symptoms with is a good way to begin before trying to investigate the possible psychological underpinnings.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  From a teen in the U.S. I have a twin sister And she’s been abusive towards me my entire life. I can’t put everything she has done into this, but I’ve been physically and emotionally abused by her my entire life, ever since I can remember (which is three). [/INST]  Why oh why hasn’t your family been in therapy? Obviously, this isn’t okay. Your sister’s behavior and your mother’s fear of her isn’t at all normal. You are carrying many diagnoses that need treatment. This has got to stop. If you or your mother could end it, you would have done so long ago.I hope the family hasn’t been “protecting” your sister by not involving other members of the extended family who might have been able to help you. You didn’t mention your father. If he is in the picture, he might be able to help as well. Ideally, your sister would be removed from your home and provided with therapy to deal with her apparent need to victimize her sister.Your family needs family therapy. If they won’t participate, at least get yourself into therapy. You need and deserve the guidance and support a counselor can provide while you get ready to leave home.If you are already in treatment (and I certainly hope you are with all those diagnoses) but haven’t talked to your therapist about this situation, please share this letter with her. Your therapist needs to know that you are living in an abusive situation day in and day out.Meanwhile, prepare now to leave home as soon as you can. Do well in school so you have a chance at scholarships. If that isn’t possible, get a part-time job and learn skills so you will be able to get out of the house and support yourself.I’m so very sorry that you haven’t had the close twin relationship that is so often the case with multiples. You and your twin should have had help with this situation long ago.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I can remember at least 3 incidents as a child, the main one being when I was around 7-9 (we were the same age). My friend and I used to play many sexual games — these included humping and kissing each other and examining each other. I remember feeling very guilty and sad about this — sometimes when I wouldn’t want to play anymore she would force me — however I was a very bossy child so I do not know how much of this was my initiative. [/INST]  You are feeling guilty about something you were involved in as a child. Please try and remember how little you knew about the world and how it functioned. You were not a fully functioning adult mind in a child’s body. You were a child in a child’s body.First of all, sexual games of the sort you have described, are very normal. If you were to study child psychology, you would see that these types of sexual exploration are very common. There are many types of exploratory play that children commonly experience. Many children have been caught by their parents playing “doctor.”I think you would feel much better if you actually did do research into children’s sexual play activities. You would find that it is innocent and quite natural. And most importantly that it is quite common. It is not commonly talked about. Sexuality in the United States is not commonly talked about. It is commonly joked about but rarely seriously, openly discussed.No child can be a pedophile because by definition a pedophile is an adult. Until you do the research that I have suggested or perhaps go to a therapist who will discuss their knowledge of the subject, I can only ask you to take my word for the fact that what you experienced is very, very common.Do you know how much money your next-door neighbor makes? Do you know how much money your mother-in-law makes, or your brother or your friend at the coffee shop? Probably not, because people don’t talk about how much money they make, or how much money they have.Do you know if your neighbor, mother-in-law, or friend at the coffee shop has engaged in childhood, sexually related play activity? Of course not, because they don’t talk about it any more than they talk about how much money they have in the bank or how much they make every year.Doing some research or talking to a counselor who is trained in sexuality, will quickly prove that I am telling you the truth.Good luck. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Dubai: Hey, I hope you are doing well. I am 18 years old, I am the eldest in the family and I have a big problem. You see, my brother is 16 years old and is in high school. I live with my mother, brother and sister. My younger brother seems to have a big issue, ever since he was a kid, he was always angry and would fight with little kids, and then gradually grew up to be a loner. He dislikes hanging out with boys his age, dislikes going out with us, or participating in any activity. He just likes to spend his time on his laptop playing Minecraft (and other games) and watching youtube videos, he never studies, barely actually… just before the exams, and ignores his chores, we can’t talk to him because he is just angry… And in our religion, praying is quite important, it relaxes the mind and he never prays, just wastes his time… We can barely afford his high school fees (30k dirhams which is around $8,167.71 US Dollar) and don’t even know how will we afford his college fees, he probably won’t receive a scholarship. [/INST]  Your brother is lucky to have such a supportive family. You’re right. He has a big problem and the things you and your family are doing are not helping him. Since this has been going on since he was a child, he is suffering from some undiagnosed problem. He needs a mental health evaluation.I suggest that the money your family is paying for school would be better spent getting him some professional help. He isn’t doing what he needs to do to succeed in school. More important is to help him have a chance to succeed in life. School can come later.I wish you well.|  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am completely falling apart. I am overwhelmed with guilt because many of my problems are self-induced. I feel I am completely incapable of making any correct decisions and I only make things worse. [/INST]  First and foremost, I am sorry for the loss of your sister. It is difficult to lose a family member to suicide, especially someone with whom you were so close. It is important also that you know that your sister’s suicide is not your fault. You may feel guilty but that guilt is misplaced.When someone is suicidal, it is a sign that they are severely suffering and likely have a serious mental illness. Most mental health professionals struggle immensely with how to appropriately deal with suicidal clients. For the layperson, knowing how to appropriately deal with a suicidal individual, even when it is a family member, is nearly impossible. Love cannot cure mental illness nor can it prevent someone from committing suicide. Family members simply do not have the education and training that is necessary to deal with the complex problem of suicide.With regard to poor decision-making, the fact that you are aware of your problematic decisions is very insightful. Many people make poor decisions and remain completely oblivious to those mistakes.You can’t change history but you can make better decisions in the future. No one can be free of mistakes but it is important that going forward, you recognize the importance of being correct in your thinking. To be correct in your thinking you need to think critically about every decision. Critical thinking skills can be learned.There are two main ways to develop critical thinking skills. The first is to study the characteristics of self-actualizing individuals. Self-actualizing individuals have the ability to see reality clearly. The more accurately you can judge reality, the fewer mistakes you will make in life. It is important to make as few mistakes as possible because you will pay for all of your mistakes, financially, psychologically and so forth. Read Abraham Maslow’s work regarding the characteristics of self-actualizing individuals.The second way to develop critical thinking skills is to enter cognitive therapy. Cognitive therapy can assist you in examining your past mistakes and the associated faulty thinking process that accompanied those mistakes. Cognitive therapy can also assist you in assessing your ability to be logical and will challenge you to make the most rational decisions.You may have made mistakes in life but you can positively affect your future by learning critical thinking skills. You asked about whether or not you have a mental illness. Though I cannot know with certainty, I do not believe that you are mentally ill. It is most likely the case that you made decisions without utilizing the proper critical thinking skills. The good news is that these skills can be learned through research or by entering therapy.

"<s>[INST] My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 1/2 years. I am 17 years old and he is 20. For the first year our relationship was as great as it could be. He was caring, and loving, and always seemed to care about my feelings and problems. But since I moved to a different city an hour away from him, he’s realized he had been giving me too much of his attention and was not doing things for himself. Now he barely calls me, and I only get to see him in the weekend. I have told him several times that he needs to call me a little more and care about me a little more. I try to communicate with him, he just doesn’t seem to care. It seems like he only wants a girlfriend in the weekends and be single during the week. That really bothers me because he’s the only person I can talk to comfortably, and in a way I depend a lot on him. (I don’t live with my parents or have a good relationship with them, also I don’t have any friends). I know I have a lot of problems, but he has helped me fix so many of them, and it just feels like he has abandoned me. I have no idea what to do at this point and feel completely helpless. I can’t talk to anyone because I don’t have anyone that cares enough to listen or talk to me. Is he really abandoning me or is it just me being too emotional about the small stuff? (I’m a very emotionally unstable person) [/INST]  When you two first got together, you were only 14 1/2 and he was 17 1/2. At those ages, he was an older and maybe wiser guy who could be someone for you to lean on. It may be it was kind of flattering to him to be needed so much. Now he is in his twenties. It sounds to me like he is feeling torn between some loyalty to you and wanting to explore what it means to be young and single. He may be ready to give up being the strong one in favor of finding a relationship that is more equal. You’re hanging on as much from dependency as from love – which is never the basis of a healthy relationship.What you do at this point is start to deal with the underlying problems that have left you so alone. Appreciate your teenaged romance for the good thing it was and let go. A relationship that is so one-sided and built on caretaking is not one that will last. You need to take over the “fixing” and learn how to take care of yourself. Find a counselor if you can. If you feel helpless about how to find and keep friends, group therapy is often a really good place to start. Take advantage of any opportunities for growth that come your way. Develop yourself so that you have a whole, healthy person to bring to the next relationship.If you need someone to talk to while you look for a counselor, you can call the Boys and Girls Town Hotline at 800 448 3000. There are counselors available there 24/7 for young people like you to talk to. Check out their website at: http://www.boystown.org/national-hotline.I wish you well.  </s>"

I’ve seen him talking to a blank space, getting so angry and trying to hurt me. As a child he tried to drown his best friend. I read his journal (I know but I’m just concerned) He has in it fantasies about murder, rape, torture. And he expressed an extreme fear of being humiliated, and that he is. I warned his school. But he just keeps getting angrier. [/INST]  I’m terribly sorry that you are in this situation. It’s a parent’s nightmare to see a child they love headed for trouble and to feel so helpless to change it.I do share your concern. If he has been able to fool several psychiatrists, it will be difficult to get your son into treatment. However, I do encourage you to take him to your local crisis team for an evaluation if he talks to a “blank space” and to call the police if he ever tries to hurt you again.There is something you can do: Go for therapy yourself. Develop a relationship with a therapist who specializes in adolescent behavior and who can be both a sounding board and a resource for you. You need and deserve the support of having someone hear what you are dealing with on a regular basis. It may also be that on learning details, an experienced therapist will be able to give you some guidance about how to get help for your son.I wish you well.  </s>"

There were also pictures posted on my instagram for both days even after i changed my password after the first day. [/INST]  Anything is possible, of course. But from what you told me, I’m thinking your brother is messing with you. It’s highly unlikely that MPD would suddenly show up in such a limited and specific way.

"<s>[INST] My boyfriend an I have been together almost a year, and I noticed some odd things about the relationship with his mother. He has an older brother and an older sister. They both have jobs, pay rent, help out, his sister is married and moved out. [/INST]  No, you’re not completely off. From what you say, this mom is not only “babying” her youngest son, but is toying with seeing him as a sex object as well. You can’t change their relationship. He can — but only if he wants to. And he may not want to. From his point of view, he has life pretty easy. All he has to do is sacrifice his own adulthood, and he isn’t expected to do anything. He quite literally isn’t “driving” his own life.There are equally pressing things to think about (besides his relationship with his mother) as you decide whether to pursue a romance with this man. Why would you want to hitch your life and your future to someone who has never finished school and has never had a job? Unless something shifts remarkably, he will not leave his mother for you. Even if by some miracle he did, he would probably expect you to pick up where mom leaves off — supporting him and babying him.I encourage you to take a big step back. You deserve to have a man in your life, not an overgrown baby. However sweet he is, eventually you will want him to do his share in supporting the two of you and making a life together. Give him the opportunity to “man up” and see what he does. Make your decisions from there.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From India: I am currently going through a lot of confusion. I became close friends with a girl (Let’s call her G) with whom I shared a deep emotional and intellectual connection even though there was no physical attraction initially. However our emotional intimacy led us to start dating. We dated for a few months and I found G to be an amazing, caring, supportive woman. I found in her a lot of characteristics that I find in my mother. We are very different as individuals in terms of our likes and dislikes but there was a deep bond we both felt. [/INST]  From what you said, this is part of a larger pattern: You either feel passionate about someone you don’t find compatible or you have deep compatibility with someone you can’t allow yourself to find sexually attractive. I think you are right. Your problem isn’t a lack of passion for G, it’s a fear of commitment. After all, if you felt passion for her, you would no longer have any reason not to marry her and make a life together.Please do yourself and G a very big favor and get some therapy to deal with your dilemma. It wouldn’t be fair to her (or to you) to marry her knowing that you aren’t interested in her physically. If you don’t deal with your mental split between compatibility and intimacy, you would probably end up having an affair after marriage. Your wife would feel betrayed. You would feel guilty.

"<s>[INST] Hi..I am an undergraduate student in the last year of my studies. I am an external student doign independent study. I have gone through a lot of emotional turmoil in the last few years. My fiance cheated on me with another girl which led me to depression. This year I broke out with my best friend and have intense feelings of guilt. Also since the last 2 years I was physically unwell diagnosed with unrine infections and was constantly on medicines. I always had a weak memory and needed to revise my studies frequently. But recently since 2010 I have been having severe forgetfulness isues. I just keep daydreaming all the time and sometimes I feel like my head is going to explod with the multitude of thoughts inside it. I keep forgetting my course work even after revising them so many times. I also find it very difficult to concentrate the moment i look at my book after 5 minutes i get up and start using the Internet or start calling someone. Its like I am just trying to occupy myself so i dont have to go back to work. I force my self to concentrate then my head pains so much. Sometimes I feel there is a huge basketball inside my head bouncing up and down. But i dont feel like that when i am reading a novel or simply relaxing. Since I am doing independent study I am most of the time at home.my parents wanted me to finish my education and regain my health back.I am often very lonely. I want to study but I cant concentrate my head pains and i daydream like crazy. I feel so lazy and lethargic. And often I feel depressed because of all these various thoughts that keep running in my mind. I also cant stop talking…If I dont talk I sing to myself.I feel like a volcano waiting to blow up. I also have a very short temper and snap at people. I get upset at very minor issues and end up crying which seems an outlet to my tense feelings. The only time I feel at peace is when I sleep. Do i need to visit a Psychiatrist? Or is it just me being lazy and not wanting to work? Please help me…I am desperate. [/INST]  You seem to be exhibiting the signs of depression including: difficulty concentrating, inability to focus, memory problems, irritability, emotional dysregulation, and lethargy. Depression makes sense in the context of losing both your best friend and fiancé. You have endured two major life losses. Your reaction is understandable.You have asked two questions, one of which is “are you being lazy and simply not wanting to work?” In light of your recent losses I highly doubt these explanations would be accurate. Depression seems like the more logical explanation.Your second question is related to whether you should visit a psychiatrist. Yes, you should see a psychiatrist and a therapist. A psychiatrist can evaluate your mental health condition and determine whether psychiatric medication would be an appropriate form of treatment. A therapist could help by engaging you in talk therapy. Both could benefit you greatly.You also mentioned that you have several ongoing medical problems. These should be evaluated by a medical doctor. Don’t neglect these problems. They may be contributing to your recent difficulties.Receiving professional mental health treatment would be the most efficient way to deal with these issues. I’m sorry but I am not familiar with the mental health resources in your country. Hopefully there is an easy way to access these services. Please take care. </s>"

Each time I start to get better things go all downhill again but each time I try to get help or reach out for my mother I get it thrown back in my face saying I’m only saying this for attention and that none of this is about me but then I get moaned at for not telling people how I feel. Kind of like a lose, lose situation. [/INST]  You’ve been dealing with your mom’s depression since you were tiny. It makes sense to me that you feel quite stuck. You want your mom to be happy, but it is at the expense of your own happiness. You don’t want to be unhappy but making any positive move toward your own happiness creates tension and misery with your mom. Yikes.I don’t think it’s likely that your mother is going to change on her own. She’s been depressed for 20 years. There is no indication in your letter that she is doing anything to help herself besides controlling you. It’s important to remain compassionate toward her but at the same time to work on getting yourself unstuck.I don’t think you can handle this on your own. You need the practical help and emotional support of another adult. You didn’t mention a dad, so I’m guessing he’s out of the picture. But do you have any relatives or adult family friends you can confide in? If so, ask them to help your mom so you don’t feel so alone and responsible. Perhaps they can help her get treatment for the depression that is ruining her life. Might it be possible for you to go to live with a relative for awhile to give both you and your mom a break?If your school has counselors, I encourage you to talk to them as well. They may know of other options for you.This is your last year of school. Start thinking now about what you want to do next. Perhaps start a part time job — both to get some experience and to get out of the house more often. Start to build a life for yourself that is independent of your mother. Think about what steps you would need to take to be able to leave home to live on your own or with friends.I wish I had a magic wand to make this situation better. Since I don’t, it’s up to you to actively find the help you need either within your extended family, at school or on your own.I do wish you well.  </s>"

[/INST]  I’m sorry that you are struggling. It’s clear that you want help, especially because of your expressed desire to be a good father to your young daughter. Children need good parenting.Your symptoms are unusual and concerning. My recommendation is to be evaluated by a mental health professional. You feel that “no one will listen” but a mental health professional will listen and provide treatment for your symptoms.How can you find a mental health professional? There are multiple ways to do this. One way is to ask your primary care physician for a referral. Another way is to contact your local community mental health center and make an appointment for an evaluation. You can also contact your health insurance company and ask what services they recommend.Typically, you will first meet with an intake clinician who will gather information about your symptoms and your psychosocial history. Next, you will meet with a mental health professional who will evaluate your symptoms and make recommendations for treatment. The treatment recommendations may include consulting a psychiatrist for medication. Both psychotherapy and medication could greatly assist you in reducing your symptoms and stabilizing your mood.One of the many advantages of seeing a mental health professional is to gain a trained and objective perspective about your symptoms. They can also provide expert guidance and social and emotional support. I hope you follow my recommendation to seek treatment. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My girlfriend is paranoid about stuff sometimes (eg.

Your girlfriend was evaluated by a mental health professional and that should be reassuring to you. It’s possible that she has something more severe than the diagnosis she received, but it’s unlikely because she was seen by a professional and we must have at least some confidence in their opinion. However, having said that, getting a second or even a third opinion is very common. But at some point we have to rely on the experts in their field or we have to conclude that we are more of an expert than they are. Often that is just because we don’t like their diagnosis. We may not like it but it doesn’t mean that they are wrong.Her symptoms are not well controlled perhaps because she is not taking her prescribed medications. That, of course, is worrisome. She should be following her doctor’s orders. You might suggest that she ask her treating professionals about trying a different medication that has fewer side effects. You might also suggest counseling. Counseling is a highly effective treatment for many of the symptoms that you have described.Generally speaking, you can make suggestions about what your girlfriend should do but whether or not she follows them is her decision. Worrying about it does not help her or you and in fact, only makes you feel worse. Do what you can and recognize that you have very limited power in this situation. You can’t control other people.You might consider consulting a mental health professional to help you address your own anxiety problems. Anxiety and stress are psychological vacuums that suck the joy out of life. They should not be your emotional norm.If you would like to right back and ask a more specific question, I will try to provide a more directed answer. Thanks for your question. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My ex-girlfriend just abruptly ended our 8-year relationship and immediately started a new relationship. Moving in with a guy she’s only know for a few weeks. She still says she loves me, misses me, feels empty without me, but that we can’t be together “right now.” We had a very loving, good, sweet relationship, but it was complicated because I’m a single father and I have had a hard time balancing everything. Often, my ex got the short end of my attention. Last year, behind my back, she thought she’d fallen for a guy who ended up being a conman that stole money from her. She developed a relationship with him while he was in jail. I didn’t discover it til’ months later. After nearly a year, she finally came out of the “spell” she was in and realized that she didn’t want anything to do with him. But that was a huge red flag that she was unhappy with both herself and our relationship. We should’ve gone to counseling, but didn’t. My question is: Is it possible for her to avoid having to really deal with our break up just by being in a new relationship? Can she really forget how deeply she’s loved me? Can she just transfer what she feels for me to someone new? [/INST]  How complicated. And how sad. Your ex seems to be a woman who can’t tolerate a “loving, good, sweet” relationship. When things get too close, she manages to fall for someone else. The excitement of new romance is a great distraction — even when it is with someone as inappropriate as someone who is in jail. I don’t think she was unhappy with your relationship. I don’t think it has to do with your children. My sense is that she can’t stand being happy in a stable relationship. The problem is with her feelings about herself.Sadly, the answer to your question is that, yes, she can avoid having to deal with your breakup and yes, she can talk herself out of her love for you. When someone’s fear is bigger than their ability to love, they can find lots of reasons for leaving. I don’t know what happened to her that makes this make a kind of sense. I do think some counseling is needed for her to come to deal with this pattern of fleeing exactly what most women would give anything to have. I worry about you accepting her if she comes back without an agreement to get that counseling. Twice is enough for you to deal with this heartache.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My spouse and I have been living apart since day 1, living in different states. He battles issues of addiction, but seems to be fine with kicking the drug piece. Alcohol is still heavily involved. He moved away in with his sister 1,000 miles away to escape the problems faced here and restart his life. He eventually married me after 3 years of dating. He hasnt started a new career, couldnt get into the military, so I want him home. He is worried that moving back will bring back bad habbits, when I feel it was just escapism and more a bandaid verus getting to the issues as drinking is still an issue. He feels most comfortable with his sister, my job is stationary my career being 10 years strong with the federal government, I dont see the need to move when he only works in a bar (of all places) but doesnt fully support himself. I feel his mind races and he has coping issues and learning how to move stuff in the past. He had issues with his parents, being mixed race. Now I want him home, I know we have things to work on, but he is more terrified of facing the area where the issues with drugs were. He is up and down, agreed to move back but still having issues with facing the area and the people. His alcohol consumption is terrible, through the roof at least 5 drinks per day and sometimes can finish a gallon in as little as 2 days. I don’t know what to do, how to start dealing with this, I know he has to make the choice, but I don’t know what I can say. I am accused of not understanding, I ask why he flew back to marry me. But I can’t seem to separate him from his sister (who is in the military). There are a few issues yes, but I feel I can’t do much when my sleep is interrupted and I am 1,000 miles away. I’m dealing with his addiction, childish fear and not wanting to leave his old go to person and start our lives, I’m ready to throw in the towel but don’t want to leave. [/INST]  I’m sure that you care for your husband. I am sure that you love your husband. I am equally sure that the relationship, though a loving one, is weak. Clearly your husband is a very troubled man. He cannot support himself, he is recovering from a strong drug addiction, and he is currently an alcoholic.I’m also sure that living apart is not a solution to his problems. I am sure that living with his sister is not a solution to his problems. No matter where he lives drugs are as readily available to him there as they would be with you in a different location.You have developed and maintained a 10 year long successful career with the federal government. That is something you should be proud of and something that you should maintain. It is a great asset to both you and your husband. I am sure that there are just as many part-time bartending jobs where you live as where he is living currently.You need to be realistic and recognize that you do not have a healthy relationship with your husband. The relationship is weak and unhealthy and one step away from a natural ending. I think it is most obvious that you love your husband. It is also obvious that he needs you, however it is not obvious that he loves you, at least not in a normal healthy way that would nurture a healthy relationship.He chooses to stay away from you to avoid the environment that, in his mind, contributed to his drug addiction. I doubt sincerely that any area in which one lives causes one to choose the use of drugs.Living with your sister, avoiding a certain part of the country are not known methods to deal with an addictive personality. He needs professional help, perhaps years of counseling to help him overcome his problems. In that long process, he could well use a loving wife who will support him emotionally and financially. Good luck. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been with my girlfriend for about six months now. She tell me that I am what she has been looking for in a relationship. I believed her, I do not hide anything in our relationship.

"<s>[INST] My 10-year-old son has been repeatedly stealing. My husband and I have spoken about this with him several times. He always promises us that he will never ever do it again and that he has realised his mistake , but a couple weeks later he brings home something that is not his. He has so far been caught at a grocery store where he was forgiven, stole from me at home to buy few books. All our efforts have been futile. Today he bought home a couple of toys that he stole from his friends. We would like to take him to his teacher tomorrow and make him return the items, but fear that he will be socially scarred for life and worse, he may stoop in to do worse things for us exposing him to his freinds .. Please help. We are desperate parents and only want best for our child. [/INST]  It is clear that you are suffering deeply. I’m sorry that you’re having such a difficult time living. My heart goes out to you.You mentioned that you were sexually abused twice in your life. The abuse that you suffered very likely has a lot to do with how you’re feeling. It also likely explains why you have difficulty trusting others. You were hurt and understandably you do not want it to happen again. Relationships are difficult. You don’t want anyone to get too close. You are guarded. In an effort to essentially hurt yourself before someone else does, you purposefully harm yourself. It may also be your way of gaining control. What you may be experiencing, at least in part, is post-traumatic stress. Post-traumatic stress is a common response to trauma. People who have experienced traumatic experiences may feel emotionally numb. Some describe this numbness as being almost detached from life.With regard to college, maybe it wasn’t for you or maybe it was. With your emotional problems, it’s not fair to judge how suitable college is for you. You went to college because that is what your family wanted. You view that as something negative but try to think about it from a different perspective. You are learning about what makes you happy; you are experiencing life. Maybe you are meant to be an artist, a musician, a gourmet chef or a college professor. It is the wrong point in your life to come to conclusions about your future career.You wrote that you essentially do not know how to continue with living. I would concur with this statement. You need guidance. Everyone in life needs guidance. You need the help of a wise, competent and knowledgeable therapist who can help you overcome this unpleasant time in your life. You mentioned depression, experiencing passive suicidal ideation, and having panic attacks. What you didn’t mention is whether or not you’ve ever tried counseling. You could greatly benefit from counseling. If you have not tried it, then you have not given yourself an opportunity to improve your life. Life has ups and downs. Your life may be unpleasant now but do not believe that it will always stay that way.I hope you will consider therapy. Please click on the find help tab to find a therapist in your community.

"<s>[INST] From Hong Kong: I’m a 14 year old guy and I don’t know if it is rare or not, but I seem to have an interest on the inside of people’s mouths. When I look at people’s mouths, I tend to have an erection, and I feel kinda excited about it. Sometimes I like to search for mouth pictures online, or search for mouth videos on YouTube, just to give myself the desire of looking at people’s mouths. Sometimes I would just weirdly (?) ask my classmates to open their mouths, and they would usually do it, and I would get really excited and I would erect. Is this a normal “fetish”? Or am I just a really weird person? [/INST]  Fetishism is sexual attraction to an inanimate object or to a body part that isn’t traditionally thought of as sexual. The cause of fetishism is unknown. It can become a problem and be diagnosed as a paraphilia if it interferes with normal sexual or social functioning and if sexual arousal is impossible without the fetish object. Because people who have a fetish are usually very private about it, there is little statistical information about the types or frequency so I can’t tell you if your fetish is “normal”.What I do know is this: At 14, you are discovering your own sexuality and may be dealing with unwanted or confusing arousal at times. You are young to find a sexual partner, but you are not too young to have sexual desires. It may be that the inside of the mouth reminds you of female genitalia that are forbidden to you due to age or culture. What started as a harmless substitute is now becoming an obsession. That’s just a guess based on little information. I only ask you to think about it.Nature is unfair. The body is often longing for sexual contact before it is permissible. I hope you are allowing yourself the very normal, usual fantasies about sex with a partner instead of avoiding normal yearnings by channeling them into a fetish that could become a problem for you. Fantasies and self-stimulation are the way that everyone practices getting comfortable with themselves as sexual beings to get ready for sexual intimacy when the right person and the right time come along.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] For my entire life I have had to deal with anxiety, and because of this I’ve always had a hard time making friends and opening up to people. Things that have happened in my past does not help this. For about a year now I have gotten very close to my now best friend. I go to her house a lot and spend the night often. Lately we have been staying up late, and have been talking about our emotions and things that are bothering us. I don’t know how to talk about how I feel or how to put my feelings into words. So when we talk it is mostly her talking and me listening. I want to be able to rant to her or to just be able to tell her whats wrong with me when I’m upset. The thing is I never know how to put it into words or how to explain it in the slightest. When I get face to face with people my mind just kind of goes blank. Would you have any advice for me? Thank you for taking the time to read this :) [/INST]  You are welcome. It is my pleasure to read and answer your question.There’s really no right or wrong way to speak about these issues. The best advice I can give you is to be honest and sincere. Honesty is important for having a good relationship. You might first try talking to your friend about how difficult it is for you to share your feelings. That might be a good start.Another idea is to write her a letter about your difficulties with sharing your feelings. Writing is more contemplative than speaking. It affords you the opportunity to think through what you want to say before you say it. It could help you to clarify your own feelings. It could be a good exercise for you and it could improve your relationship with your friend.Relatedly, you might want to start writing a daily journal. Many people believe that journaling is very powerful. It allows you to organize your thoughts, detached from the busyness of day-to-day life, clarify your feelings, increase your memory, identify patterns of behavior and thinking, and so much more. It’s something to consider. I hope this helps. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My mom has been cheating on my dad for many years, and I have also known for many years. Let me start with a short summary of my parents’ relationship with each other. It’s terrible. My mom has directly told me that my dad doesn’t help her emotionally or physically. She even told me that if it wasn’t for me and my other siblings, they would’ve gotten a divorce such a long time ago. Since I was around 10 years old I noticed that my mom is on the phone with the same person A LOT. I know it’s the same person because the same number comes on the screen every time she gets a call (she doesn’t have a contact for him.) When I was 10 years old I asked her if she was cheating and she lied straight to my face. She told me that she wasn’t cheating and that it was just a friend. I forgot about it for another year and started thinking about it again when I was 11. I’m 14 now and I’ve been holding this in for so many years. Every time I think about it I get anxious and shaken up. I look over her shoulder and see flirty messages from this person, and I’m started to hold grudges against my mom. I feel like I’m 100% going to explode on her one day, but I love my mom to death. What can I do to help myself get through this? Should I talk to my sister about it? Should I tell my dad? I haven’t even told my closest friends (or anyone) about how I’m feeling about this. I just need some advice. (From the USA) [/INST]   Thank you for talking about this with us. Your mom has put you in a very difficult position of having to keep a secret — which isn’t good. The anxiety and tension that this has created certainly isn’t fair, and you need some support.You didn’t mention your sister’s age and I think it would be difficult for her if she were younger. It also sounds like it may be difficult for your dad — and if your mother has been so careless he may already know. I think the first place is to get some support outside of your family. Your school counselor is a good place to start. He or she can help guide you with next steps. You have done well speaking about it here. I would take the next step and talk to a professional who can guide you.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I had looked over the characteristics of one on a website before I had even thought about myself potentially being a narcissist because I was and still am very interested in psychology. And as I was reading, I was relating to the symptoms. [/INST] It is a brave thing to open yourself up to feedback here and I think everything you are talking about has more to do with you being fifteen years old than a personality disorder. As a teenager, you will be more egocentric than what will typically be true for you later in life. It is a very well-established fact that adolescent egocentrism is part of the developmental process and it is a necessary stage in development. According to adolescent psychologists, it may actually have a lot to do with future healthy psychological growth.It is natural to think about the things you are thinking of- for the most part. The parts of your character that you’ll want to be more mindful of try to change are those parts that lie to get what you want and thinking you are always right. These are common character flaws that will not serve you well as you mature. Struggle to be more honest with yourself and others—and listen more to what others have to say. This will help keep you more balanced as you mature.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi, I don’t know whether I am just reading too much into things or whether there actually is something wrong with me. I have noticed that I am very sad quite often I have also noticed that I tend to fidget a lot and cannot stay quite for long, I also have mood swings very regularly where I will be completely fine and then get really moody with friends and family for no reason. I get stressed out a lot over the smallest of things and cannot get anything done as I get too easily distracted. I have a very short attention span and cant spend much time on things before I get bored and give up, I tend to space out a lot as well and just snap back into reality after about 10 minutes which makes concentrating in class very hard. I also used to have tendencies to become very violent and lash out at people for no reason. I am not sure whether this is normal or not and whether I am just getting worked up over nothing but these symptoms have been going on for about 7 years now and don’t think that is normal to have felt this way for so long, so I am asking you to get a professional view on this as I don’t want to mention it to my parents just in case they tell me I am being silly and there is nothing wrong with me [/INST]  Seven years is a very long time to be worried about something. I can’t offer a diagnosis on the basis of a letter. But I can tell you that the distractability and fidgeting is consistent with ADHD. The moodiness may have more to do with your age than a mental illness. But, again, I can’t really make an assessment via email. A professional who can talk to you and get to know you can be much more helpful.I suggest you share your letter and this response with your parents. Sometimes worrying about something can be as distressing as the original problem. Ask them to help you make some appointments to help you understand yourself better.I suggest you first see your physician to make sure that everything is fine physically. The teen years are a time of enormous physical growth and change. Sometimes it takes awhile for the body to adjust. If everything checks out medically, then see a mental health professional for an assessment. When you know what you are dealing with, you and your parents can make informed decisions about what to do to make life a bit easier for you to manage.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] They think it can go away over night. I am currently 18 years of age and have been suffering from depression since I was 9. For years I wasn’t aware of my depression but since it’s gotten worse it’s pretty clear that I am suffering from it. So far it has stopped me from living a normal life, I never go out. I’d rather stay in my room away from everyone, even my own family but now it’s starting to bother them. I know they want to help me and they’re trying to get me started in life by getting me a job but I just feel like they’re pushing me. You see, they’ve gotten me a job in a pub and I only work on Fridays but it’s completely out of my comfort zone, I’m no where near ready for something like this and it’s just adding pressure but my family don’t seem to understand that. They say that only I can help myself get better but I know I can’t do it on my own. I haven’t even been to seen a doctor yet so I haven’t been officially diagnosed with depression but I took an online test that said I have major depression and so I told my mum about it but she just seems to ignore it, thinking it will go away over night. This is really frustrating me, I can’t get the help I need and I’m just getting pushed into a life which I’m not ready for yet, I feel completely useless and pathetic. So far I’ve only refused to go to work, it’s just too much to handle and all I get is shouted at which only makes me feel worse. What do I say to my family to make them understand what I’m going through? [/INST]  You could try having a serious, heart-to-heart conversation with your parents. If that is not an option, then consider writing them a detailed letter about how you’re feeling. Writing a letter gives you an opportunity to thoroughly explain your experience with depression. It would help to include a statement regarding the seriousness of depression and that excellent treatments are available.You may want to consider giving them this letter and my response. It might convince them that you could benefit from professional help.Your parents seem as though they are trying to “push” you out of your depression. They may believe that forcing you out of your “comfort zone” will help you to overcome your symptoms. On one hand, their strategy may not be totally off base. You have gotten to the point where you don’t like leaving your room. Limiting your activities to only those that are within your “comfort zone” reduces your anxiety but it reinforces your fears. Avoiding uncomfortable activities makes your symptoms worse.On the other hand, their attempts at helping are causing you significant distress and it does not seem to be working. It is also driving you away from them rather than bringing you closer.Professional help from a mental health professional is what is needed in this situation. Ask your parents if they would be willing to take you to a therapist. A therapist can assist both you and your family in understanding and correcting this situation. Individual therapy and family therapy may both be helpful. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I received a letter from a reader that is much too long to post. However, he raised an issue that may resonate for others so I’ll put a very edited down summary here: [/INST]  One of the issues you didn’t explore is why a preacher’s son would become a chronic liar. I’ve seen it any number of times. One possibility is that you didn’t feel you could live up to the standards that were set by your parents. Not feeling you could be the best, you went 180 degrees and became the best at being the worst — and you did it mostly secretly so you could maintain their high regard but protect your self-esteem by identifying yourself as a successful liar.The Marines apparently gave you a “second chance” and, to your credit, you took it. But once you went back into familiar surroundings (and without the high structure of the military) you slipped right back into your “old skin.”In your letter, you mention that you tried counseling only once and with a religious counselor. I suspect that a counselor with those credentials is too similar to your parents. I also think that you probably lied to the counselor.I strongly urge you to seek out counseling from a licensed psychologist who does not identify as a religious counselor. Send a copy of the letter your wrote to PsychCentral plus this response to the therapist before your first session. That will at least lay out the problem honestly and will jump start your treatment.Your letter was a good first step but unless you follow up, it will go nowhere. Do make an appointment with an experienced and licensed therapist and get down to the real issues. You are still young. You can still change and make a better life for yourself.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’d been seeing this guy for maybe two weeks and I hadn’t ever kissed anyone before him. he kissed me and that was all fine but then later when I was half asleep he just wouldn’t stop touching and trying to make out with me. I told him that was enough and he’d stop for a bit but then just keep doing it. it made me feel uncomfortable so in the end I just lay there and pretended to be asleep. Over the next few days I kind of brushed the whole thing off saying that he only did it because he liked me but after a while I realized I just couldn’t stop thinking about it. I broke up with him a while ago now but I still think about it all the time and it makes me feel sick and really embarrassed. I feel like I can’t be in another relationship because the very idea of kissing someone makes me remember what happened. But at the same time, I feel like I’m over reacting and the only reason I felt uncomfortable is because I’m so frigid. I just don’t know what to think about the whole thing and I don’t want it to ruin my chance at new relationships. I currently find it hard to see myself being happy in a relationship and I don’t know what to do. Please help! (From Australia) [/INST]  My best guess is that what is most troubling is you not responding and pretending to be asleep. Putting the focus on him rather than on your reaction is likely to be where the discomfort is. I would recommend you talk to a therapist about this reaction as it is likely to be closer to the source of your discomfort.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"

"<s>[INST] Since I began masturbating around eight years old or so, I have had sexual fantasies about incontinence. When I was younger, I fantasized about indulging in this fetish with others but nowadays I only think about being incontinent on my own in a cabin far up in the hills in some woods where noone can find me with an incinerator! So basically, it has to be far away from real life and very hidden for me to find pleasure in it and to escape the shame. I do also have completely normal fantasies and nowadays have to force myself to think about this fantasy in order to orgasm, but it doesn’t naturally come into my mind and, until properly aroused, I still find it genuinely disgusting. [/INST]  There are many sexual fetishes that involve urine or urination. It is also very possible to feel guilt or anxiety about a sexual fetish. Behaviorists would have one explanation for this phenomenon but other branches of psychology would have different explanations. Psychoanalysts would also have varying explanations.The same area of the body that provides sexual pleasure also is used for urination and defecation. You can see how easily these two processes could be associated within the mind of a child. Parents often make a strong point of telling a child that these areas of the body are dirty and when you touch yourself there you must wash their hands immediately. Many of these children grow up to feel that sexual activity is also dirty. Any pleasure that comes from a “dirty thing” is something that they feel is wrong and as such should produce guilt, they should feel guilty about wanting and liking something that is so dirty.Sexual fetishes could also be easily explained by early association. Behaviorists believe that phobias are the result of unintended pairings of unconditioned stimuli with conditioned stimuli. For example: the child cuts his finger, he is bleeding, the child has no reaction to the blood. The blood is a neutral stimulus to the child, meaning he has no reaction to the blood. However, the mother screams. The scream of fear of the mother is the unconditioned stimulus, which produces the unconditioned response which is fear and crying, within the child’s mind. The child sees the blood and associates blood with the unconditioned stimulus which is the mother’s scream. Through this one accidental pairing, blood or the sight of blood now has the power to produce the same unconditioned response as does the mother’s scream. This associative learning can endure for a lifetime. As a result the child and in the future the adult, will feel terror at the sight of or thought of blood. In a similar fashion, if a child accidentally feels sexual stimulation while perceiving urine he could later associate urine or urination with feelings of sexuality.Many therapists who do dream interpretation, would interpret a dream about a bathroom or going to a bathroom in a public place, as a sexual dream.Many women report female ejaculation and have for many years. Many researchers deny the possibility of female ejaculation but new research has shown that it may be real. Some researchers believe that female ejaculation is really urination but others believe it is not. Recent studies suggest that it is not urine at all but rather a substance that contains many of the same chemicals found in ejaculate. Scientists believe that female ejaculation occurs most frequently with G-spot stimulated orgasms. You are presently seeing a urologist. If there is any anatomical irregularity, I am sure that your urologist will discover this. There may not be any irregularity anatomically or otherwise.In my mind the biggest problem is the guilt that you feel and also the anxiety. You mention in your letter, that you have not had an orgasm in three years and the event that has prevented you from orgasming in three years, was a small amount of urination at the time of your last orgasm. In my ideal world, I would want you to feel no unwarranted guilt, to have no anxiety, and to have a healthy, normal, pleasurable sex life. Notice, that I had no concern for the small amount of urine that is present at the time of your orgasm. The only concern I have about this is the fact that it produces for you anxiety and guilt.I would highly recommend that you see a competent therapist, perhaps sex therapist, counselor etc. They could quite easily help you with the issues that we’ve been discussing. I’d like to close this answer by telling you a story that I well remember from one of my early psychology classes. The professor told us about something that Freud had written. He said that Freud had received many letters from the mother of a homosexual man and that the mother had promised Freud a large amount of money, if he Freud would help her child to no longer be homosexual. The mother told Freud how grateful she would be if he helped her son. She told him how worried she was, how she could not sleep at night and the great anxiety that she felt in her every waking moments. My professor went on to say that Freud wrote back to the woman and told her that he could very well understand the problem. He told the woman that he would be happy to schedule her for regular appointments because she was the one who had the problem and the problem was her anxiety and not the homosexual activity of her son. Freud told her he did not believe that the son had the problem but that she did.I hope that you will take my advice and make an appointment with a competent therapist. You should not be living in fear or anxiety. You should be having an anxiety free sex life, with all the pleasure it can provide. If you have any questions please write back. I wish you the very best. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From India: I am married for over two decades. My wife’s elder sister is also married and is around a year older than I am. She stays in another city and visits her parents every year, or two, as my in-laws also stay in the same city as ours. Though not until many years after my marriage but, over the years, I have become very fond of her. I find her very beautiful, very charming and full of virtues, so much so that I cannot keep my eyes off her when we meet. I am obsessed with her emotionally and miss her presence for weeks and months after she returns to her city. Her departure always leaves a big void in my life and I keep thinking about her long after she is gone. My wife is the only emotional support I have and she is very caring and full of virtues, too. I love her a lot. However, I often strongly feel like opening my heart out to my S-i-L but am afraid that all hell would then break loose because my S-i-L is a woman of great character and cannot even think of reciprocating such feelings towards me. Nevertheless, I feel sometimes that if I confide in her then, maybe, she might keep this as a secret between the two of us as its divulgence shall ruin her sister’s marriage. I realize that my conduct is unbecoming of a husband and also immoral but I feel completely gripped by her thoughts. What is your advice? [/INST]  However charming and beautiful she is, your sister-in-law is not available. To tell her your feelings would damage your relationship with her and your relationship with your wife. It could even damage the relationship between the sisters and your relationship with the entire family. Even if your S-I-L kept your secret, this would be so. She could not look at you without knowing that you are betraying her sister.But you know this. In spite of knowing it, you persist. Instead of looking deeply at yourself and why you won’t totally commit to your marriage, you distract yourself with the excitement of the forbidden. Ultimately, this will destroy the relationship with the wife you say you love.I think you are asking the wrong question. You say you love these two women but you are not committed to either. One of my best teachers used to say that two relationships are fewer than one. Spreading your feelings over two people means that neither person gets all of you. For some people, this is a way to avoid taking the total emotional risk that is involved in really joining with another.My advice? Get into counseling and deal with whatever it is that frightens you about really marrying your wife — all the way. Only then should you make a decision about what to say to the two women.I wish you well. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a woman in the U.S.: I have never been able to get an answer to this. We got a family puppy when I was in the 9th grade. Our puppy was scared of being in boxes in which he couldn’t climb out. He would panic and cry for someone to get him out. My mother enjoyed putting the puppy in a box to see what he did and let him panic and cry until I couldn’t take it anymore and picked him up. [/INST] According to the Mayo Clinic, “a personality disorder is a type of mental illness in which you have trouble perceiving and relating to situations and to people — including yourself. There are many specific types of personality disorders. In general, having a personality disorder means you have a rigid and unhealthy pattern of thinking and behaving no matter what the situation. This leads to significant problems and limitations in relationships, social encounters, work and school.” People don’t always neatly fit into one or another of the personality disorders. Often there is an overlap of symptoms.You tell me that your mother may have narcissistic personality disorder. It sounds to me like your mother also has a sadistic streak. The connection between narcissism and sadistic personality disorder has been explored in the research literature.If a person is sadistic, it means that he or she derives gratification from punishing, harming, or abusing others. Most people don’t purposefully inflict physical and/or emotional pain on others because they have empathy for others (including animals) and a strong sense of morality. Not so the person with sadistic personality disorder.Not everyone with narcissism also shows sadistic tendencies. Most narcissists have an inflated view of themselves, have difficulty getting along with others, and need to feel in control to feel safe. But they don’t  get satisfaction from inflicting pain.Narcissistic and sadistic people generally have low self-esteem. It is thought that both generally are the result of confusing negative to abusive experiences in early childhood that result in inferior feelings. To compensate, the person goes overboard and acts superior. In the case of sadists, one proof of superiority is the ability to inflict pain. It is unknown if there is also a biological factor that contributes to the behavior and thinking of those with personality disorders.Engaging these people in treatment is difficult. From their point of view (since they believe themselves to be superior) any problems in relationships are the fault of the other person in the relationship. Your mother’s response is typical. She thinks what she is doing is funny. She isn’t able to empathize with the pain of the pets. She doesn’t understand why you don’t share her amusement.  But, if by chance, she starts to understand that she has a role in why others are upset with her, there is treatment that has been found to be helpful. Often it includes medication and cognitive behavioral therapy.I wish you well. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  Hi! I’m a young teen, and I have depression, that I suppose is kinda severe, General and Social anxiety. Around 2 years ago I was put on anti depressants, which have worked pretty well. Around a year ago, I abruptly stopped taking them without really telling anyone. I’m not really sure why, but I did. This was around the holidays, and I was on vacation with family friends in a vacation house owned by some of their relatives. Now, it was a beach house, and, being the middle of winter and family meant that it had not been cleaned beforehand. I was originally sleeping with my friend, but moved to my mom’s bed. My father passed away when I was 9, which caused some underlying anxiety to get worse, along with the typical grief and depression. I slept ok for the first night, but on the second night, I could not relax. It was storming, and an outside swinging door was banging on the wall. This put me on edge. There was one or two old stains on the sheets, and because of that, I started picturing bed bugs or whatever in the bed. (Not hallucinating, just imagining). I then started to get the “bugs crawling on you” feeling, and started sobbing and babbling nonsense. I tend to do that when I get panicked. After around 15 or so minutes, my mom gave me my prescribed lorazapram, and I calmed down and went to sleep. The worst part was when I was on the 5 or so hour drive home. We have a minivan, and I like to sit in the way back to have more space to spread out. My younger sister, 9 at the time, was sitting in front of me. I’m not sure how it started, but for what seemed like most of the drive, I was having a panic attack. But it was different. I also was hitting my sister, hard enough to hurt her, screaming nonsense, and basically having a tantrum. We live in a historical area, and while we passed signs for places I had been, I started yelling at my mom to go to the places. I really have no clue why. It was horrible. I was basically curled up in a ball, screaming and hitting my sister for at least an hour. I really can’t remember much. I’ve had other episodes like this, but not this bad. [/INST]  The problematic episodes you have described occurred almost immediately after abruptly stopping your antidepressant medication. That might explain your symptoms. One should never abruptly stop taking medication. There are a variety of dangerous reactions that can occur with the sudden discontinuation of antidepressant medications. If you wanted to stop taking your medicine, you should have consulted your prescribing physician.After discontinuing antidepressants, many people experience physical changes and mood disturbances. People often feel irritable; it can affect their sleep, their balance, their ability to concentrate, and so forth. Discontinuing medication can be difficult. It’s common for people to stop taking their medication when they feel better. When they stop taking it, many of their symptoms return. They fail to appreciate that it was likely the medication that had led to their improvement.It was a mistake to stop taking your medication without consulting your prescribing physician. I would recommend telling both your parents and your prescribing physician about what has happened. You should also consider adding counseling to your treatment regimen. Counseling is the ideal place to learn stress management and problem-solving skills. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi! I’m wondering how to keep your calm around very agitated people. I can usually be peaceful in crowded/loud places no problem, but my mother-in-law is a very dynamic and anxious person, and whenever we have a conversation I feel exhausted and drained at the end (even physically). She gesticulates a lot with her hands but also moves her head very rapidly up and down and to the sides when she talks. She also has a high-pitched voice and talks very loudly, borderline screaming (not usually because she’s mad but because she’s very expressive). I also get cut off a lot when I speak, and she finishes my sentences for me, but most of the time, it’s not even what I wanted to say… And it’s not mean spirited, she just rolls at a faster pace than me, and told me many times that she’s impatient. I also have very sensitive ears, which does not help in this situation and feel easily excitable around her, like a golden retriever, but in a more stressed/anxious way. I try taking deep breaths when I notice myself getting agitated, but is there anything else I could do to keep myself calm and peaceful? Thank you so much for your help! (age 30, from Canada) [/INST]  I’m wondering if you also get agitated around other high energy people or just your mother-in-law. Taking some time to reflect on this might also help you know how best to respond. It’s one thing to be sensitive to all loud, gesticulating communicators and another if you really only feel drained after interacting with your mother-in-law. Either way, staying calm will be key.Try mentally preparing as much as possible before the interaction. If she gets loud, keep your voice at a low volume. If she speaks faster, keep a steady pace yourself. Focus on listening to the content of what she is saying rather than trying to take in all the extra movements and tones. Finally, with her in particular, I would speak to her about the differences in your communication styles and see if you can find ways to meet in the middle.In general, it can also be helpful to use imagery and metaphor to keep your energy separate from others. You can imagine that you are surrounded by a bubble of light, that a window is between you and the other person, or imagine a mirror between you and the speaker with the mirror facing toward them. It can also be helpful to ground yourself before and after the interaction. There are many ways to do this but saying a mantra or prayer and taking a deep cleansing breath are great techniques. You might also benefit from taking a class on communication, or even meditation or yoga. Hope these suggestions help.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi, Please help. In October 2013, my Granny had passed away due to a long term battle with Cancer. Shortly after this (January 2014) my Girlfriend of 6 years had developed Psychosis and spent the next few months going in and out of hospital. I have stayed with her for the past year and a half dealing with it. throughout the past year, I have had two friends that were getting rather violent and angry towards me and stopped talking to me as a result in April. I had a friend commit Suicide in May. I have other friends whom I talk to and see every now and then, However I feel as if they are avoiding me. [/INST]  You are dealing with a number of recent losses which understandably have made you upset. On top of that, you have noted possible symptoms of depression.I don’t have enough information to know if you made the right decision regarding your girlfriend. You said that staying with her would’ve led to severe depression but did not say why. If you are correct, then it would seem that breaking up was the right decision.She is also experiencing her own psychological difficulties. Neither of you sound healthy enough to maintain a flourishing relationship, at this time. After you both are more stable, maybe then consider reestablishing the relationship.You should consider counseling. Depression and relationship problems are two of the most common reasons people enter counseling. Counseling can provide you with guidance about your relationship and teach you how to manage your possible depression symptoms.Another option is a grief/bereavement support group. Many people benefit from talking about their losses. Sharing your loss often facilitates the healing process.Once you are feeling more stable, you will be in a better position to make decisions about your future and with whom you want to spend it. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My friend (16 male, no family issues, no relationship, Newton Utah) has confided in me about “trances” or “blurry mind things” that he gets. On a hunting trip with his brother, father, and grandfather, his mind went slightly blurry, his shotgun drifted towards his brother and he thought “I can get all three of them and no one will know.” It really freaked him out. He loves his family very much. It is completely uncharacteristic of him to think any harmful thoughts at all. He told sometimes in class he’ll think of how to take out all his class members. How he’ll “tactically” kill them. He loves to air-soft, plan, and wants to become part of the secret service. He was home schooled until this year and is taking a police class of sorts in school. He told me that strategizing is his true love in life. I’m worried about him and tried to research his condition but nothing came up. He has never picked up a shotgun again since when he had thoughts about murdering his family. I know he needs help but we wanted to get some more information first, before telling his parents. Its really hard to tell family about this kind of thing. I want to help him. But I also want to respect his wishes of researching it first. ANY information you can possibly find would be of the utmost help to us. Thank you so much for your time and have a wonderful day. [/INST]  Thank you for telling us. This is important. I deeply appreciate how much you want to help your friend — and the time to do that is now. The fact that it scares him, that he’s told you, and that it scares you — is all the research we need. It is time to tell his parents. The label for this isn’t as important as the fact that it causes so much distress. Labels don’t help people — people do — and your friend needs help. Your friend trusting you and the obvious quality of your friendship is what is important. I wouldn’t wait. You and he talking to his parents together is the right thing to do. I admire your courage and taking this proactive action. I would do this sooner rather than later. Now is the time.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 7-8 months. He is an amazing man and I am very much in love with him. He is sweet caring, hard working, and he adores me. He has one flaw, but its a huge one to me. He’s jealous and insecure. [/INST]  I’m glad to see that you already know that your relationship is past saving. You can’t help him. He has serious trust issues that cause controlling and abusive behaviors. However much he means it at the time, his promises to change haven’t resulted in any positive action. You are wasting your time trying to talk, reason, or argue with him.Run, don’t walk from this relationship before you get hurt and before you become even more distant from the self you want to be. Then please take some time to think about what you can learn from this experience so you can avoid getting involved with another insecure and controlling person. You absolutely deserve better.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Well, I must admit that I’m somewhat embarrassed about posting here for help. I find myself in a difficult position and would appreciate some advice. [/INST]  You should not be embarrassed to ask for help. You’re doing exactly what you should be doing. In my opinion, you have actually waited too long to ask for help. You began experiencing problems in high school but ignored them. Had they been dealt with then, these problems might have already been resolved.Millions of people receive mental health treatment in the United States. These people include lawyers, doctors, high-ranking military officials, congressmen, senators, and so forth. They may have received counseling or are taking psychoactive medications.HIPPA laws guard your privacy concerning mental health treatment. Neither your employer nor your insurance company can obtain psychotherapy information without you signing a detailed authorization form. If you do not personally tell your employer that you are receiving mental health treatment, then they would not know.You are concerned that treatment would inhibit your ability to work in your chosen profession. I believe those fears are unfounded. Treatment would enhance the quality of your life, not diminish it.The best way to begin treatment for depression is to speak to your primary care physician. Ask for a referral to a mental health professional. PCPs are general practitioners who have many connections with specialists in the community. You can also try searching for a mental health professional by clicking on the “find help” tab above and entering your zip code. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My mother and stepdad have been having financial issues for a few years now. They also have 3 small children that they need to support. For almost two years I have been lending my mother money, which she pays back at her leisure. About a year and a half ago they had their cars repossessed in which case I ended up having to lend them my car almost full-time. She had agreed to help me make payments on both the car and insurance, and she did for a little while, then it stopped. A few months ago my parents lost their house and had to move in to my place. I have a 3-bedroom townhouse, with my 3 children, and 5 more people moved in. They were supposed to pay half of everything, but they haven’t. I’ve been paying my mothers cellphone bill, the water, electric, cable etc. All on my own, and it’s becoming a huge burden. Since my husband and I are separated, I can’t afford it at all. And I’m behind on all of my bills. Every time I bring up money to my mother she gets mad and calls me ungrateful. The only reason I really have put up with it, is because of my younger siblings who are all still in elementary school. I don’t know how to get my parents to stop taking advantage of me. I rarely ask for anything in return. Occasional babysitting so that I can work, but that is it. I’m in debt, not to mention the emotional stress that I’m under with 6 kids and 3 adults living in a small townhouse. It’s hard to function properly. My mother doesn’t understand the burden she’s put on me, and there is no way to make her understand. She won’t hear it. If I bring anything up how I feel about anything she’s defensive and angry. She throws in my face how she went through hell with me when I was a teenager, like I owe her all the stress that I’ve been under. I’m trying to raise my own family, and it’s been extremely difficult under these conditions. Even my children are being affected by these circumstances. I don’t know what to do anymore. [/INST]  This isn’t going to change until you make it change. I wish there was an easier answer, but you must not allow your mother’s inability to effectively manage her life ruin what you have built up for yourself and your children. You do not owe your mother anything. You didn’t ask to be brought into the world and you have long since balanced the scales since you were a teenager. At 26 you cannot be in orbit around your mother’s life. Your obligation is to your children and they are not going to get a whole mom if you are carrying this resentment.Pick a date for your mom and stepdad to leave and explain that this is something that you are committed to. Her anger is only designed to make you feel guilty. Don’t take the bait. Explain that you can’t have her stay and you cannot continue paying. Your mom needs to grow up and move out. Stop paying for her cellphone. Let her be angry—she might need to feel that until she can finally take responsibility for herself.I am not suggesting you do this tomorrow. But I am suggesting that you explain what your timeline is and do not let up on it. The stress you are under will not go away on its own. You have to stay well for your children and yourself. Your mother’s anger is nothing more than attempt for her to avoid her responsibility. She might profit from Debtors Anonymous – a 12-step group for people in chronic debt. Take care of yourself now, and let your mom have the dignity of having to manage her own problems.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"

What’s wrong with me? [/INST]  I appreciate you sharing your problems with intimacy with us here at Psych Central. It seems as if this reaction has been part of your personality make-up for a long time. I have three suggestions, and depending on where you think you could jump in, you can take advantage of one, two — or all of them.First, I would find the therapist trained in cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT. This form of therapy — when done individually — can be very effective in helping you learn how to challenge your thinking. Anticipating your own reactions, combined with the consequences, have developed a thinking pattern. A CBT trained therapist can help you undo this.The second recommendation I have is to immerse yourself in a class where you’re learning something new you’re interested in. Learning something new — with new people gives you the advantage of interacting and connecting, but all under the umbrella of developing a new skill. This can be a way for you to meet new people in a safe environment with a common goal. This often helps.Finally, the most direct way to deal with this is in group therapy. It might take you a while to find a group therapist, but a group does two things simultaneously. First is a direct challenge to your inhibition, and secondly the group can support and help your transformation.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"

She showed me her wounds she made and a knife she use. She save all her dried blood on tissue and write the date she harm self on it.

"<s>[INST] My cousin “Robin” is 58. She’s single and lives alone. I’m her only family and I live 300 miles away. She is about to lose her job due to her personality disorder. She’s an intelligent woman, but over the course of the last 20 years I’ve noticed an increasing inability to manage daily affairs. She is a complete anomaly to me — scatterbrained & unable to focus to the point of incapacitation — then OCD and histrionic on the most mundane of non-issues. She alienates friends and family by talking in non-stop circles — obsessing about a topic until she’s beaten it to death (and then questions herself and starts over). All the while, she’s unable to perform basic tasks in a timely manner because she get’s distracted. I’ve recently seen her take two hours to but breakfast on the table — even throwing the scrambled eggs out because the first batch didn’t set up “just right”. [/INST]  You can try to make your case to Robin about why you think she needs help but be prepared for her to reject your advice. Given the information that you have provided about her, she doesn’t seem willing to seek help, especially because she “doesn’t trust medicine.” Her distrust of medicine might extend to counseling. That type of attitude often means that an individual will be unwilling to seek help, even if it’s obvious to others that it is needed.On the other hand, her having utilized alternative forms of treatment, in the past, might indicate that she may be open to getting help.After you have made your case to Robin, you have basically done all that you can. She will either take your advice or she won’t.That is the unfortunate reality in these situations. People have to want to help themselves.You can’t force someone to do something they don’t want to do. She is an adult and, despite having a personality disorder, she has the right to say no to treatment.She blames others for her problems, doesn’t take responsibility for her actions and is on the verge of losing her job (because of her behavior). These actions are characteristics of certain personality disorders. Blaming others for one’s problems and never taking responsibility for one’s own actions are why some personality disorders are so difficult to treat.If she refuses to seek help, don’t take it personally. She would likely be saying no due to her personality disorder and not because of a personal dislike of you.Even if she says no to treatment, you can still be her friend and provide emotional support when necessary. That might include calling her once a week or visiting her on occasions, and this may be all that you can do. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years now. We had a good start but then my boyfriend started complaining that I wasn’t giving him his emotional needs. I first didn’t realize what he needed and he kept complaining and fighting for the past 2 years and I only understood and matured lately. I’ve been trying to give him what he needs for the past 2 months but he won’t open up. A few days ago, he admitted to me that he was emotionally cheating on me and that he just figured it out and he kept apologizing and crying, begging for my forgiveness and telling me he’d give me whatever I needed but that he didn’t want us to break up because he couldn’t bare losing me. He admitted he was totally wrong and that he had no excuses but the reason it happened was that he wasn’t getting what he needed from me and he swore he never went looking for his needs elsewhere and he kept pushing the girl away but he got weak after a while. My boyfriend has never been unfaithful and I know he loves me insanely, he’s just over friendly with girls and I honestly find it really difficult to deal with, because I’m very insecure, because I find his behavior exceeding “limits”, and especially that he wouldn’t accept me to behave this way around guys. [/INST]  Of course only you can make your choice, but I can tell you what I hear in your letter. It is interesting to note your description of this relationship. Both of you are trying to respond to each other, but it isn’t working.You have been with him for two years (since you were 17) and it may be time for a break. You may simply have been helping each other through a tumultuous time in your life. At this point trusting him is difficult, and his efforts at trying to be affectionate haven’t worked.Being attached doesn’t mean being in love.This may simply be a habit. His instinct was to turn to someone else rather than put the effort in with you to make it work. Perhaps that tells the tale. Take a break you can both stick with and see if your feelings change. That will give you time to decide if you want to work on the relationship. If you do decide to make a go of it you may want to try some brief couples therapy. Your college is likely to have some good people on the counseling staff that can help.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Vietnam: I am having a lot of problem in my relationship recently. And it seem to be the same problems that happened in my last relationships too. I had many broken heart relationships in the past too. I feel like I can’t handle a normal long term relationship. When things are normal and perfect, I tend to start ruining it and getting anxious. I start picking up a fight or being unreasonable and non sense to my girlfriend. Luckily I haven’t made any serious damage yet because I try to hold it up but it’s just escalate more and more in my action and behaviour until I brought us down together. Then I feel satisfy and guilty. [/INST]  The first step to solving a problem is recognizing it. I applaud you for facing something that must be very difficult for you. I am very glad that you haven’t complicated things by getting addicted to drugs or alcohol.It may be that something happened to you either while growing up or when you started having romantic relationships that made you pessimistic about whether someone can really love you. You very much want a relationship, but you fear that you will be rejected. One way to resolve that dilemma is to ruin a relationship before the rejection you imagine actually happens. That makes you feel more in control and preserves your self-esteem. You “fire” your girlfriend before she can “quit” on you (as you are sure she will do).You are wrong that you cannot stop this. You are only in your 20s. You are not hopeless. Your letter shows that you are smart and insightful. Now you just need some help to overcome your pessimism. If you could do it on your own, you would have done it already.Unfortunately, I’m not familiar with the services available in Vietnam. If there are counselors, I suggest you see one.

"<s>[INST] From a teen in the UK: 5 months ago I was attacked in town one night and a group of people (around my age) beat me up and tried to hurt my friends. Since then there hasn’t been a single day where I haven’t thought about that night and often worry about it happening again, it causes me to get very upset if people start shouting at me or anything like that because I get scared that they’ll hit me, even if it’s someone close to me and I know really that they won’t hurt me. It’s also caused me to be very paranoid when I go out and the other day when there was a man behind me on the canal I started crying and may have had a panic attack and had to call my friend to calm me down. I know it’s probably nothing as serious as PTSD but it’s really starting to interfere with my life and I don’t know what to do anymore. [/INST]  Yes, it is possible that you are suffering from PTSD. Everything you report supports the possibility of that diagnosis. Your daily anxiety tells me that you need to confer with a professional. There is no shame in responding as you have to such a traumatic event. You are having a normal reaction to an abnormal situation.You’ve already tried unsuccessfully to handle it on your own. In spite of trying their best, your friends haven’t been able to help you either. Your symptoms are serious enough to take more seriously. That means making an appointment to see a therapist who specializes in trauma work.Please don’t hesitate to talk to your parents about what happened and how you have been feeling since. Show them this response if it would be helpful. A few sessions now can help prevent your current level of anxiety from growing into something more intractable.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am having a difficult time dealing with my past abusive relationship. My ex, who I was with for two years was emotionally and sexually abusive. I ended the relationship almost a year ago but am still having a hard time. I occasionally have flashbacks and get frightened or angry and cant stop thinking about what happened. I feel guilty for being so upset because there are other people whose experiences are so, so much worse than mine, but I am still having a hard time getting over it. I am now with a really amazing man who knows about what happened. He really tries to be supportive, but has a difficult time understanding. He gets angry because he doesn’t understand why I allowed someone to do that to me for so long. He thinks that I stayed for so long because I actually enjoyed being sexually abused, and although he doesn’t mean to, he makes me feel like he thinks I am disgusting. He also says that it feels dirty and wrong to instigate anything intimate with me, because unless I initiate it, he feels like I won’t tell him if it’s something I don’t want. He tries so hard to keep me from feeling like I have to do anything and is so worried about making me feel the way that my ex did that I’m afraid to tell him when something he does triggers me, because even though I assure him he has done nothing wrong, he still feels like it’s his fault. I don’t know how to talk to him without us both feeling like horrible people and I don’t know how to get over what happened when I feel like it’s invalid for me to be upset at all about what happened, since it wasn’t as bad as what many people experience. [/INST]  It sounds like your earlier relationship was traumatic and that you’re continuing to react to it. I would recommend EMDR, a trauma treatment protocol, to see if you can lift the feelings from the past, as untangling yourself from that experience is the first order of business. I’d also recommend would work with a couple’s counselor very briefly to repair the relationship you have with your husband now. This can put you on a new path. Here are links for couple’s counselors, or you can find one in your area by checking out the find help tab at the top of this page.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have always picked my skin. When I was little, it was scabs, and not just your everyday children picking scabs kind of thing, I would bleed and scar terribly and I was at the nurse’s office all the time. Then, shortly after I discovered picking and biting my lips. There was never a week I went without having large sores develop in the areas I would bite, and I would bite the sores too before they were scabbed. In middle school, I started picking at my acne although I never got that much, the pimples i did get left nasty scars. My lips are constantly bitten at, you will rarely see my hand away from my lips. In efforts to stop biting my lips, and I know this is very disgusting, I began to pick at the inside of my ears until they would bleed. I had nasty scars and infections, and would get comments from friends and family asking what they were from. Most of the time I don’t even notice I’m picking my skin. But it gets so bad sometimes that when I’m really anxious, I scratch at my hands and pick a those scratches while they are still raw and bloody. I don’t think its self harm, I don’t do it to hurt myself intentionally, I just feel like I’m going to explode if I don’t. But something especially unsettling is that a few hours ago I began to peel at the soles of my feet. There is thick, callously skin there and I haven’t had my hands away from there since. The gash in my skin is a light pink color and i have an olive toned skin. It is in a half circle around my ankle and covers about 1/3 of the surface entirely from barely over an hour of picking. It’s bloody in spots too. I feel very disgusting and germ-phobic about feet, so when I catch myself doing it I wash my hands and tell myself. I’m done. This has happened at least 4 times now. My foot burns and I cannot walk on the heel of it at all without great pain. I really can’t stop even while I’m writing this and I need help. Thank you.  [/INST] A:  Thanks for writing in with your question. I agree that you do need some help. First, it sounds like you may need to see a medical doctor for this latest episode because it sounds more severe and is making it difficult to walk. You could be risking infection if you have open wounds that are not being treated. Second, you have not mentioned ever seeking any form of treatment so I am assuming that you have not seen a therapist and suggest that you do so. Skin picking (Excoriation) is a psychological disorder similar to obsessive compulsive disorder and impulse control disorder. So, it is a real condition that you can get help with. You do not have to feel guilt or shame about it either. It would be no different than if you were to develop diabetes or another medical or psychological disorder. Please speak to your parents and your doctor soon about finding a therapist qualified to treat this condition.   Here is a link to an excellent article that might help you understand this disorder a little more fully: http://www.trich.org/about/skin-faqs.htmlIt may be helpful for you to share the article with your parents as well.There are many treatments available to help you deal with the anxiety you feel inside.  As you develop other ways to cope with your feelings and impulses, you will give your body time to heal as well.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve been with my boyfriend for 2 years and 7 months. Since we are getting close to our next 3 year anniversary, he told me he wanted to talk to my family because he wants to ask me to marry him. I love him so much and of course i want to marry him, but before that i want to confess him something. I was planning not to but it’s making me feel uneasy and terribly bad. I do want to tell him but i want to be sure if am doing the right thing and how should i tell him. [/INST]  It speaks to your maturity and character that you want to start your marriage with a clean slate. I would hope that your boyfriend understand that there’s a difference between lying and keeping personal things private. Lies are meant to manipulate and deceive. Privacy is about self-protection and preserving some personal boundaries. I think the stories you’ve shared fall into the latter category.Let’s start with the easy one first: You ran up debt when you wee younger. You have been doing the honorable thing and are paying it off before you marry. You aren’t asking him to be burdened by it. It seems to me that this is your own business. If you choose to share it, I would hope that your boyfriend would see that not only did you learn your lesson about debt but that you have learned how to handle money so it won’t be a problem between you.The miscarriage does require a conversation. You didn’t lie. You don’t have children. But you didn’t tell the whole truth either and medical history could affect things in the future. It’s understandable that in the early stages of your relationship you wanted to keep such a personal thing private. As your intimacy with your boyfriend has increased, the boundaries between what is personal and what affects both of you has changed. I imagine you and your boyfriend will want children someday. Your doctor will want to know about prior pregnancies in order to give you the best care. In general, family members shouldn’t know things that your husband doesn’t.You are 30. I imagine both of you have done things in the past that you wish you hadn’t. People who have lived life and had experiences generally also have some regrets. Regardless, all of our experiences shape us into who we are as adults. We don’t get to pick and choose. I hope that you and your boyfriend will be able to talk about your histories with a focus on who you’ve become and your hopes for the future.I worry about your level of worry about such a conversation. If your boyfriend is so judgmental that he can’t be understanding and sympathetic when you talk about such issues, maybe you should rethink marrying him. Life is far too complicated to hold it against someone for being private about private matters.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi. I’m gonna resume my life so you understand why I’m asking if I’m insane. Basically, my parents were both drug addicts before they had me. They quit when they found out mom was pregnant and then moved in with my paternal grandparents. My dad, although he quit drugs, he did not quit drinking and became an alcoholic. He spent most of his time hitting mom and she would hit him back. After mom died when I was 8 he became even more violent and started hitting my grandparents. He once hit me too. My grandma is suicidal and has attempted suicide 4 times. In middle school, kids would make fun of me all the time, call me names, and hit me. High school is pretty much the same situation. At home, dad says I’m dumb and won’t get anywhere in life because, as he says, I can’t do anything right. Now I know I’m not the smartest person in the world but I don’t consider myself dumb either. I’ve thought about killing myself but I’m hoping I’ll live a happy life once I get out of this place. My dad makes everything miserable and I’ve planned on killing him. I’ve thought about buying some kind of poison and putting it in his drink. This is why I asked if I’m insane. I can’t go to a real (and by real I mean someone who’s in front of me) psychologist because my dad doesn’t like that. [/INST]  I’m so sorry you are faced with such a difficult home life. No one should be subjected to abuse, violence, neglect, and misery.You asked about whether you are “insane” for considering poisoning your father, the father who abuses you and also those around you. No, your desire is not “insane” given the very troubling set of circumstances you face on a daily basis but murder is immoral and illegal. Your desire may be understandable but you must never attempt to carry out your desire. You could spend the rest of your life in prison.It is imperative that an adult or professional intervene in this situation. There are multiple ways to achieve this. One way would be to call child protective services and report what is happening in the home. Your father would be investigated and removed from the home if it is determined that he is perpetrating violence.You could also speak to a school guidance counselor or a faculty member including the principal, school nurse, a teacher, etc. It’s imperative that you let someone know what is happening at home.Finally, if you feel that you might harm your father or harm yourself, call 911 or go to the hospital immediately. You can be helped by emergency professionals. They will provide immediate assistance and connect you to mental health professionals.It is important that you let someone know what is going on. I’m concerned about your safety and the safety of others in your home. When people are hurting and are in severe distress, they may make choices they will later regret. When people are highly emotional they’re not always thinking clearly, which underscores why intervention is needed promptly in this case. In the meantime, is there anyone with whom you can stay, another relative, a friend, etc? If it’s possible, you should temporarily remove yourself from the home.I hope you will take my advice and seek assistance immediately. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m a 17 year old female.  I constantly feel the need to have a mental illness because I get bored by normal things. I have obsessive thoughts about having bpd I think that makes you special. I have most of the symptoms except for impulsivity/reckless behavior and extreme fear of abandonment . I also don’t have anger issues but I feel empty like nothing matters much as before. I don’t even want attention I just need myself to be satisfied. I’m super-cautious and almost never take risks. I believe I have less severe form of social anxiety as I find it really hard to start conversations and I don’t express myself because I think I’m weird and different and people will judge. I have a history of self harm and suicidal thoughts  and childhood sexual abuse. I also used to see things that aren’t there but I don’t know if I made myself to believe that I am seeing things or if they were real. I also feel like no one really knows me and am so good at hiding things – like I’m another person in public and can switch off my emotions. My paranoia sometimes disables me to do anything. I am also supersensitive and can get hurt easily by words but I don’t show it. I just wanna know if I have bpd i don’t even care to get better cause I feel more comfortable being my real self which may be sad or in pain ( it’s like I get bored by being happy I don’t want to be stable). Thank you! [/INST]  I would recommend seeking a psychological assessment from a clinical psychologist.  Psychological assessments involve various tests which will provide a specific clinical diagnosis, if any such diagnosis exists. Given your present age and the various symptoms you have described, I believe it would be helpful for you to do this to get clarification into the symptoms, thoughts and feelings you have been experiencing. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Australia: My daughter is in her early 30s. She is married and lives overseas. [/INST] What a complicated situation. You are in the middle of a family where people escalate arguments very easily and hold grudges.I can offer you a few suggestions:Remember that it takes 2 to have an argument. There is no point in staying on the phone for a 30 minutes argument. When speaking with your daughter, emphasize the positive. If she picks a fight, simply say that you aren’t interested in fighting and that you love her very much. Then say a friendly goodbye while letting her know you will be happy to talk to her again.Don’t get caught up in drama: Stay out of your daughter’s relationship with her mother-in-law. Gently tell your daughter that your relationship with your husband’s children is not something you can discuss with her. Stay out of your daughter’s problems with her husband except to validate her concerns about her marriage and to applaud her choice to get into therapy.Your present husband has a role in the problems. He rejected your daughter’s attempt to acknowledge him when he refused to take part in her wedding. He lost his temper and hit her. His apology is a good start but only a start. I think you and your husband need more help than I can offer in a short response. A therapist will provide you and your husband with on-going support and practical help as you navigate so many complicated relationships. You’ve tried your best to manage all this on your own without success. You both deserve the ongoing support a therapist can provide.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been seeing my therapist for 4 sessions now to talk about things related to my family, my past, just difficult things I had to go through and our goal is to understand myself better. Now this last time I saw him, he asked me what my sexual fantasies were. I don’t understand how it could be beneficial to talk about them but I didn’t think of that at the time so I didn’t ask him. But is it a violation of privacy’? Is it out of line of him to ask me that? (From the UK) [/INST] Thank you for your email. Therapists are trained in a variety of different ways and what might seem inappropriate for some is perfectly natural for others. The fact that this caused a strong reaction is important in and of itself. I would use your discomfort as the basis of your next session. Rather than my trying to assess whether or not the therapist has overstepped his boundaries with the question, I’d rather see you talk to him about your reaction. Since you’re just beginning to see the therapist all the questions you’ve asked here are appropriate to ask him. Finding out what is the nature of the question, why is it beneficial to talk about this, and importantly — that you feel as if it’s an invasion of your privacy. While difficult I think these conversations are essential for you either building a deeper relationship with the therapist or moving on.Just to give you a taste of the various forms of psychotherapy here is a blog that helps distinguish the four major ones quite well. While it is common for therapists to be “eclectic” in their approach most will identify with a primary type of therapy the conduct.As for the goals and effectiveness of psychotherapy and different formats, there are many. In this blog you can learn the different modalities and approaches that are used.But of all the points about various forms of therapy, therapy styles, and therapist’s training I think the most important feature of your question is that it concerns your rights as a mental health consumer. Your rights are important to know and understand as part of the treatment process.Central to your rights is your involvement in a treatment plan with the therapist. Again, this varies depending on the modality (such as individual versus group therapy) and methodology. All of your questions are good ones, your concern is legitimate, and your feelings about being asked are an important part of the process. Even if it ends up that you wish to leave talking to your therapist about your reaction is important for your growth, regardless of if you stay with the therapist or not.To learn more about your rights you can check out this post.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My much older boyfriend is going through a messy divorce. He wants to be with me, but has a troubled son my age. I met my 45 year old boyfriend about a year ago. We weren’t thinking and I ended up in a situation where I was his VERY young (21) mistress. He’s the love of my life, but he already has children – something I’ve wanted of my own. They are sons roughly my age, and one is VERY rude and troubled. I was scared that he wouldn’t want to have children with me in the future, so I left. Later that week he finally separated from his wife, like he kept saying he would. [/INST]  Guilt is one of the worst reasons I can think of for staying in a relationship. Trust your instincts. Your concerns are not unreasonable. They are coming from somewhere. If your boyfriend hasn’t been willing or able to insist that his son treat you with courtesy, it’s a red flag. If you really want a traditional love, it’s likely that you will resent not having it.Yes, it’s hard to let go of a love relationship. I’m sure there are very sweet sides to this man or you wouldn’t be involved. But it is also true that you fell in love with him when you were only 21. You are now a year older and wiser. Now that you are past that intoxicating period of new romance, you may quite reasonably be rethinking the situation and whether it’s really for you over the long run.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] So in the last year I have lost +50 pounds. I did it the healthy way. Now in the last few months I have become obsessed, I am constantly thinking about food finding out what I will eat planning the calories for the day. I try to make myself eat more calories because I know I’m not eating enough (usually less than 700) I can’t stand eating with people because I feel like they will make me eat more so I always make excuses to not go. I get major anxiety when I do eat, because I feel guilty and it’s like there’s a voice in my head telling me I will get fat if i continue eating and once I eat a few bites of something I know I shouldn’t have I will end up eating anything in sight and I want to puke, but I never have. I never go anywhere because I have a schedule for everything and certain times where I eat and exercise, although I think this is because of my OCD. I workout everyday and then I will ride 2-3 horses a day. I can’t stand the thought of being fat again especially because I know how hard it was for my old horse to carry me around when I was overweight and every time I reach a goal weight I set another that’s less. People tell me I’m thin, but all I see is fat. I know this is bad and I have tried to stop these behaviors but thoughts saying I’m fat,obese, ugly keep coming back. It’s driving me crazy its like there are two people bickering in my head constantly over what I should do and I can’t decide which one is right. I am always cold, dizzy, and tired/fatigued. I have wanted to tell someone about this, but then they might think I just want attention or think I’m weird. Currently I’m 5’6 or 5’7 and 120 lbs (age 15, from US). [/INST]  Thank you for writing in with your question. If you were to look up the Body Mass Index (BMI) for your height and weight it would say that you are in the healthy range, but losing 50 pounds in one year at your age is too much for your body and mind to handle. It sounds like you could be developing an eating disorder and/or body dysmorphic disorder so I feel that it’s important for you to get some professional help now before it gets out of hand. You are thinking too much about food and having negative emotions, such as guilt, attached to eating. That is not a good sign.You should be able to enjoy the weight loss and be happy with your life and your body, but it sounds like the negative thoughts and feelings have taken over. Furthermore, the fact that you are also having physical symptoms such as dizziness and fatigue is another sign that you should speak to your parents and your doctor. If you aren’t sure what to say you could print off your letter and my response suggesting that you get some help. Don’t worry about what people think of you, it is your health and your future at stake. You deserve to be happy.All the best, </s>"

This is now my ex boyfriend, but the love of my life and his too, he says, but he can’t get past this. This trust issue happened 5 years. His ex wife cheated on him. This has ruined everything.

You said it very clearly here, now it’s time to say it clearly to him. Let him know that because of what his ex-wife did he is interpreting everything as if he’s going to be betrayed again. Explain that it is not fair to you because it means that, in spite of what you do, say, or share with him, his mind interprets it as a betrayal. This leaves you helpless. The pain his wife has caused him in the past is never-ending in his future. Be clear about the fact that this is not yours to fix. Any woman he dates is going to be seen as a cheater because in his mind he can only foresee it happening again. Here’s a link to an excellent article about this kind of trauma.Tell him that it feels miserable to be mistrusted when nothing you’ve done warrants it. I would be very clear about this putting all the responsibility for his perception and struggle in the relationship on him. Don’t mince words.I know these are strong terms. But the bottom line is he either changes his attitude and sees you for who you truly are or there is no need for you to be with him.Finally, offer to go with him to see a couples therapist. This can be both supportive and enlightening for him. This gives him a chance to hear what you have told him from a neutral third party, get support from you by going with him, and give him a chance to see the dynamics he is causing.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am 24 years old. There always seems to be something to worry about. Before I had my child I dealt with a lot of anxiety all my life. I am now dealing with being a homemaker. I quit my job that I have had since high school to be at home with the children ( I have no experience with children prior and have had to jump in head first). I never resented my stepdaughters or my husband (recently married) before I became pregnant. After I got pregnant I was overloaded with fears and anxieties over everything. Now that the baby is here (she is 8 months old now) I had hoped that some of it would lessen but it hasn’t. I feel anger at my husband (because he does not believe I should be acting this way (I agree with him)I am always raising my voice with my stepdaughters because of frustration that they cannot understand, they cannot listen to direction, that I have to be their mother but receive none of the appreciation and unconditional love that their biological mother receives after she has abandoned them for a year and now wants them in her life again, for not being able to work anymore because we couldn’t afford child care for them, that I have to deal with one of them being possible ADD. None of this is their fault or mine. I feel frustration at my own toddler as well. I don’t want to hurt any of them at all. Before I was pregnant we played, talked, and lived together happily except for some of life’s little bumps we were happy. I dealt with the occasional depression growing up (my own as well as my fathers Manic depressive episodes) but I have never felt so much anger, frustration, and lethargy in my life. Is this postpartum depression or is it manic depressive behavior? If so can you recommend a place or support hotline or something?

"<s>[INST] I found out my mom is having an affair, what do I do? My family lives in Rome, and I go down to visit once in a while during breaks. a few days ago I found out my mom is having an affair through her skype chat that she forgot to close on our computer. It has all these details including the fact that she’s knowingly keeping it from me. She wrote that she didn’t want me a part of her personal life, at least not yet. not only did that hurt me, but a message about meeting him in Florence finally clicked when my mom told me she was going away next week, but wouldn’t tell me where or with whom. I don’t know what to do. a lot of websites say just to leave it alone, but I’m a single child, and extremely close to both parents. My mom is my best friend and I feel constantly sick knowing that this is going on. Please let me know what to do, I feel helpless. [/INST]  What a dilemma! I thank you for writing us here with the question. This might fly in the face of what you have read, but the truth is trying to keep this secret is not going to be easy and is likely to erupt down the road. Since your mom was careless and left her chat open I would tell her you saw it and that her carelessness has put you in a difficult position. Let this be your mom’s issue to deal with. She has made choices that she must now cope with. You not telling her means that you will have to carry the family secret. This is likely to create great stress for you, and most likely will come out in the future.If you do not feel this is doable I would make an appointment with a family counselor, explain the situation to him or her and get some guidance. You may also make e appointment for you and your mom to go together and talk to her about what you found.I am definitely not in favor of keeping the secret. It puts you in the middle and creates difficulty for you. It is likely that you will resent your mom and feel uncomfortable around your dad if you try to keep it. Every family event is likely to haunt you, and when the issue comes out (which is very likely –if you found out, your father is likely to as well) it may strain your relationship with your dad if he knows you knew.If your mom is having an affair there are problems between your mom and dad. By talking to your mom you are putting the issue where it belongs, not taking it on.

Your husband needs to be much more directly involved with his family concerning how they treat you. This sense of entitlement, mistreatment and alienation is something that you and your husband need to address together. Dynamics like this are designed to split the two of you apart. The most important thing is for you and your husband to be on the same page with how to deal with them.This does that mean isolating or alienating yourself. Offering them invitations to come to your place and you and your husband having a plan for how to receive them would be important. Going back onto their turf seems like a bad idea. When you were there, the treatment of you was horrific. Why put yourself in their crosshairs again?

"<s>[INST] For quite some time now, I’ve had this overwhelming sense of emptiness as if something about myself was somehow off kilter. Everyday I go through the same self-scrutinizing process. Waking up, “what the hell’s wrong with me?” Showering, “why am I such an awful person?” Brushing my teeth, “Damn, my conscience is seriously a hot mess right now.” You get the idea. This vicious circle is pretty much part of my everyday routine. The scariest thing by far was my recent revelation of my sociopathic behavior.

It’s pretty futile and silly to lie to your conscience, but I digress. [/INST]  Yes. As a matter of fact I do. I don’t think you’re a sociopath. You are too angry with yourself for that. I do think you are in significant distress and that you need some serious help. You know that too.

Actually, they never did. It’s time to try something that is proven to be helpful. You need to get a thorough evaluation by a qualified psychologist and talk over a treatment plan that is based on his or her findings. Take your letter with you. It will provide an efficient overview of your issues.Remember that therapy is for you. Lies may impress the therapist but where will that get you? Judging the therapist or trying to seduce won’t get you anywhere either. Please be selfish enough to skip the drama and get the most out of therapy you can. Accepting the attention and support that good therapy provides can help you have a more satisfying life. Go for it.I wish you well.  </s>"

I’m sure there must be some positive qualities or you would not have stuck by him for so long. But now that he has shown the truth of his character, I hope you will do everything you can to put lots of distance between you.The good news is that you are only 31. You have lots of life ahead of you. Learn from this hard experience and look for a man who will love you and only you and who will be the father that your kids need. Don’t waste another second of your love or your time on the old BF. Make yourself available to a healthy guy.If you find it hard to let go, please do consider seeing a therapist. Your self-esteem has taken a major blow. You may need some help and support to build yourself back up again. You deserve it. Your children deserve to have a mother who feels good about herself and who can show them what love and a healthy relationship look like.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] This feels kinda stupid but I know I need help? I’ve slowly lost touch with everyone in my life, including my whole family. I have exams coming up and everyone expects me to do amazing but I can’t. I can barely find energy to get up in the morning. there are times when I feel like crying, even though there’s nothing wrong. I’ve always got a headache, or stomach ache, or just generally feel ill. I think I hate myself and this makes me hate everyone else too. I feel like I’m ‘digging my own grave’. I talked to someone honestly, and she basically told me to ‘suck it up’. Sometimes I wonder if she’s right though, maybe its just me being a twat. Recently, I’ve buried myself in all the fantasy worlds in tv shows. My whole family seems more complete without me, and just generally happier. The friends I used to have got left behind as I moved schools, and I ended up with the popular kids. I just don’t wanna cry anymore. I’m just so tired. and I can’t talk to anyone. my parents think I’m crazy, and I’m making stuff up. they’re too busy with my siblings to even notice me half the time. sometimes I wonder if they wish they didn’t have me. I’ve also gained a lot of weight. it sucks. I’m taller than my own dad like is that even possible? and fat. I’ve tried working out… I look like an idiot. I just want to leave everywhere, but that isn’t possible. I’ve been brought up as a Christian, but sometimes it feels like even god doesn’t want me. I went to a retreat, and came back happy and refreshed. no matter how much I pray I cant get it back. it seems like whatever I do now I always wrong. I’m so sick of being here. sometimes I wish I could just sleep till I’m old. talking to people makes me feel like an attention seeker, begging them to notice me. but I need their help, I don’t know how to ask for it. Everyone keeps asking me if I’m alright, apart from my parents. I thought they were the people who were meant to notice you and know you the best? I always say sure I’m okay but I literally don’t know. I wanna leave home. (From England) [/INST]   At 16 years old I can say that many of your feelings are shared by others you age. It isn’t easy trying to figure out where to fit in and how to choose a direction in life. I admire the fact that you are trying different things to feel better even though you don’t feel supported by your family. This takes courage and resilience and isn’t easy.The sadness you are describing can be coming from many sources. I would just tell your parents that you are not feeling well and ask to go to the physician. Your parents may have an easier time if they believe you need medical attention. When you talk to the physician explain to him or her that you are having these thoughts and feelings. The physician can do two things. One, he or she can check out if there is anything physical that may be causing your symptoms. Secondly, if it is time for some counseling he or she can talk to your parents about the need and help make a referral.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve been happily single-by-choice for many years. Definitely not even considering ANY possibility of new “romantic” relationship. Out of NOWHERE, I started constantly thinking about & plotting ways to spend time with a man approx 15 yrs younger than I. He works evenings & nights as a security guard where I reside. He’s been working here for approx. 6 mos. I’d seen & even spoken briefly to him several times previously, but without a hint of warning I became “closer” (no physical exchanges due to my faith & beliefs). Here’s the kicker: he couldn’t be FURTHER from what has always been my “type”. Where I live there are many different nationalities & people from many diverse ethnic backgrounds. I’ve always been attracted first & foremost, by physical appearance & to races other than mine (Caucasian). This “young man” is Hispanic, having only arrived in Hawaii last year, and is pure WHITE, skinny, shaved head, big ears & a horrible physique. Now’s the time to add the fact of my extremely good, rare physical shape-not only for “my age” but for women in general. I’ve had 5 large babies but have always been very athletic-serious weight-lifting for many years as well as running, canoe-paddling etc. In 2009 I realized my 35-year dream & underwent an abdominoplasty which removed 2 lbs. of loose skin only-no liposuction needed-& complete abdominal muscle restoration (stretch marks & scars are history & I’ve had extensive tattooing over the surgical scars. People think I’m “fibbing” when they learn about my large family because my body definitely is not the “norm” in the many-children dept. I’m 5′ 2″, still somewhat muscular, have long, straight hair (in which I keep all traces of white from becoming obvious) & am feisty & energetic. I’m certainly not movie-star gorgeous but not too shabby for 61* So…what is up with my totally out-of-character attraction to this guy? He has a beautiful accent I call “Sprench” for Spanish/French because it sounds like a little of both. He’s been very kind & considerate but I think I’ve frightened him with my hyper, “dog-with-a-bone” personality. He’s separated from his wife, who’s in CA. I mean, if my kids ever knew about this they’d think I’d totally lost it. I have 2 bodybuilder sons & all my children are super attractive, as are their kids. What do I do??? [/INST]  You may have matured to seeing and connecting beyond other attributes you’d found attractive. By the way you’ve described your background and situation it seems like your previous “types” didn’t work out. Someone’s type is almost always also a euphemism for their troubles. Since there is no romantic inclination and his uniqueness, kindness, and thoughtfulness are real elements of the relationship it might be worth letting it be an evolving friendship — rather than an obsession. Any new relationship has an intensity that wears off and becomes more compassionate. My guess is that this will evolve in the same way as you are not looking for it to be romantic. It isn’t always a pathological thing to feel good in the presence of others.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I’m 17 and I don’t like to speak and I try to avoid every situation where I have to speak. I’ve been doing this since I was little but I would only avoid speaking to other children. However as I got older I stopped talking to teachers. When my teachers called on me I would just stay silent. Now I’m doing it to my family. When my mother or siblings says something to me I just stay silent and they think I’m ignoring them. I’m not. I have a reply in my head but I just can’t bring myself to say it out loud. [/INST]  I’m very surprised that your parents or teachers didn’t address this with you long ago. What may have started as a little anxiety has now become a much harder to break long time habit. The longer we are silent, the harder it is to speak.One of the important developmental tasks of the teen years is finding your own “voice”. That means more than the act of speaking. It also means finding out what’s important to you and learning how to express yourself to others. Conversations are one way that we all clarify our thinking, refine our interests, and learn who we want to have as friends and, eventually, what kind of person we want to have as a partner. This is important stuff. You don’t want to miss out on it.I encourage you to make an appointment with a counselor. In the safety of a counselor’s office, you can start to deal with the anxiety that is at the root of the problem and start to break the silence habit. You don’t need to become a “chatty cathy” to be okay. But you do need to become more comfortable expressing your thoughts and feelings. I really believe you have much more to say than you think you do.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I decided to see a private therapist for the first time today, and after the session I felt like it was pointless (I have met with a school psychologist before, and she was absolutely amazing, & professional, so this made me question today’s experience.) [/INST]  I don’t know anything about this particular therapist. It seems like you and I are similar in this regard. I don’t know how much experience he’s had. I don’t know what education he’s had. I don’t know what degrees or training he has completed.You and I differ in one very important detail: you’ve had the experience of sitting through a lengthy session with him. The result of your session is that you have little trust for him, little confidence in him and serious reservations about returning. That’s enough. Any one of those things is a more than sufficient reason to find another therapist. You list a number of other reasons why he might not be the right therapist for you, but the only important one is that you are left with serious reservations after your long session. It is these reservations and those alone, that say you should look for another therapist.It is the therapist that matters, not the surroundings in which he works. Many of the most successful and highly paid therapists in the world, conduct therapy in an office at their home. I’m equally sure, that some of the worst therapists in the world also conduct therapy at their home office. In many ways it doesn’t matter where the therapy is conducted. It only matters how good the therapy is. Many well-known celebrities and wealthy members of a community, seek out a therapist who does not have an office and waiting room in a public building. They simply do not want public exposure. They don’t want to be seen opening a door that says “therapy, therapist, counselor, psychologist, psychiatrist, etc. They don’t want to be sitting in a waiting room with other individuals and hear their name called out. They seek out privacy and anonymity.I cannot say that they are either right or wrong to prefer privacy and anonymity. If they prefer it that way, then that is certainly the right way for them. If entering a public building for purposes of counseling or therapy, is in any way anxiety producing for them, then by no means should they do so.You have no obligation to return to your therapist. Forget the book. Mail it back to him, have a friend drop it off on his porch, place it in his mailbox or simply donate it to the local library. The fact that you feel somewhat compelled to return, due to the possession of his book, shows an unhealthy power balance. He should have no power over you and you should feel no need to continue with him. You did not ask to borrow the book. He handed you the book and said read this before our next session. He did not respect your wishes as to whether or not you would want to have a second session. He never asked. Would I say this is unethical? Yes, I would.The next time you look for a therapist, make sure you get all the answers to the questions that I have listed above. Expect that often you will have to try two or three or even more therapists before you find one that you like and respect. The therapist that you had chosen, was the only one that offered you a discount and agreed to see you. That is not a basis for choosing a therapist. Don’t feel bad that you made the wrong choice. You tried and believe me, trying is the most important thing. Keep trying. I guarantee you that there are good therapists out there and I also guarantee you that there are poor therapists out there. Choosing a therapist is not like buying a loaf of bread. You might say “all white bread tastes pretty much the same, so I’ll just buy the one that is cheapest.” Sometimes, you just can’t afford to buy anything other than the cheapest bread. When that occurs, you might ask yourself if you really need bread. If it turns out that you don’t really need the bread, then perhaps it would be best to wait until you can afford a better loaf of bread. Also remember, that often times the best bread is not the most expensive one. Find a bread you like and find a therapist you like. Neither has to be the most expensive one. It just has to be the one that you find, you like the most. Good luck and don’t give up on your search for good therapy. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I truly believe that I have high functioning autism. I have a lot of the symptoms, if not all of them. I have taken multiple online tests and they all say that I do have autism. The only problem is, is that my mother will not take me to get tested. I need a diagnosis, but I do not know how to get one without my mother. What do I do? [/INST] I admire your desire to understand what it is that you are struggling with and finding ways to cope with a mental health concern that involves impairment in social interactions with others.Autism has been identified as a spectrum disorder, meaning that the range of symptoms can be at level one, as you are identifying, high functioning autism. Level two autism and level three, which is severe. In level three individuals require substantial support in coping with life because they struggle a great deal with communication and social interaction. Often there is a type of rigidity that prevents adequate coping with changes, and highly repetitive behaviors interfere with normal functioning.In level two autism individuals need substantial support and clear deficits in social interactions. Typically there is great difficulty coping with changes as well, and there is also an inflexibility and repetitive behaviors.Finally, in high functioning autism individuals need some support and benefit from learning how to initiate social interactions. The inflexibility with behavior shows up when there is difficulty switching activities and there are problems with organization.To take a test PsychCentral’s test on autism go here and another one here which includes information on what would have been called Asperger’s (now high function autism.)In order for you to move forward, since you identify yourself as being in the 9th grade and 15 years old, I would take the results of the quizzes and set up an appointment with you school guidance counselor, of a trusted teacher. Ask to have a meeting and explain there is something important you need to discuss.Show the results of your quiz and this response. Explain how it is that your issues align with these results, and be prepared with specific examples from the classroom, and other social encounters. In other words, if your mother won’t argue your case bring it directly to the individuals at school. You mom may have many reasons for her position, as it may require testing, classification, and other interventions that she may be opposed to. What you would be asking for from the counselor are direct ways to help. I imagine that there are socialization groups that might be helpful in giving you strategies for developing more social interaction skills.Please write us back and let us know how you made out!Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Over the past year I’ve been starting to have panic attacks, or at least that’s what I think they are. They’re extremely sporadic (two in October, another in November, then nothing until one in April and a very bad one in May; haven’t had any others since). [/INST]  Something is obviously wrong. Your symptoms are telling you something. You are not sure if you are having panic attacks. Though I cannot know with certainty, your symptoms seem consistent with panic attacks. You would need a psychiatric evaluation to determine a diagnosis.As you noted, extreme anxiety is often rooted in the fear of losing control. But there’s a difference between fear of losing control and being out of control. It’s possible that some aspects of your life are out of control and thus you are reacting with panic. I would need more information to know what the problem might be.I don’t think it’s a coincidence that these problems have coincided with your first year of college. People have ideas about how college is “supposed” to be. Their expectations rarely line up with reality.You might be taking too many classes or chose the wrong major or the wrong group of friends. You might also lack stress management and coping skills. Studies show that college students are experiencing mental health problems at epidemic levels. The heart of the problem often involves an inability to tolerate stress and manage life problems. The good news is that these skills can be learned in counseling.I would recommend that you begin counseling. When you return to school in the fall, you can then utilize the schools counseling center for more assistance. The bottom line is that depression and anxiety are highly treatable conditions. You will feel a great deal of relief once your symptoms are under control. It would be unwise to ignore these symptoms or to simply hope they will go away. Both anxiety and depression tend to worsen without treatment. Don’t suffer with treatable problems. Treatment will be immensely beneficial. I hope you will try it. </s>"

Got along with everyone, my senior year I lost my best friend, I almost didn’t graduate I couldn’t pay attention in class I just didn’t want to do nothing it took me about 3 years to finally pull myself together. I met my fiance and he showed me life again. I have been great up until a year and a half ago. I can’t go out to public places I fear everyone is looking and laughing at me because I’m ugly or fat (I’m not ugly or fat) my fiance has to do everything (go grocery shopping take the kids to school,take them to doctor appointments.) I have no friends cause I cut them from my life I don’t talk to my family no more. I literally just stay in the house all day. I don’t want to feel like this I have tried going out with my family but I freak out I start breathing heavy my heart races my hands get sweaty, I start crying and I just want to get home. If I do go out to the store I walk with my head down and I try not to make eye contact with no one. I get in and get out. I’m tired of feeling this was it’s literally taking over my life and my family’s life. I can’t even take my children outside or to the park. I feel like a crappy mother and wife. Please help me.

"<s>[INST] I am 15, and I think I may be sociopathic. A part of me has always thought that something was off about me, so I did some googling and ended up reading articles about sociopaths and the symptoms of being one. [/INST]   I don’t know that labels help that much when it comes to the kind of symptoms and reactions you are having. So I wouldn’t label them as sociopathic. Rather, I would say that these reactions are causing you distress and they concern you. I would say your lack of emotion and contrasting angry reactions, lack of regret, and poor impulse control (not thinking through decisions) is the range of emotional reactions that might best be served in group therapy. Being in a group with your peers would help you learn more about why these things happen — and what you may want to do about them. I would talk to your school’s guidance counselor to get an idea of what groups might be available for someone your age.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am 40, professional and from the outside, I’m sure it seems as if I’m doing fairly well. I’m in a job that should be a “dream job”. I have been happily in therapy for a long time and I believe I’m pretty self-aware. However, a lot of who I am is tied up in my professional life and it has been very dissatisfying lately. [/INST]  I do not believe that your age has much to do with your desire to use drugs. Younger individuals might be more prone to drug usage but people use drugs at all ages. As you stated, much of your identity is closely tied to your professional life. You have described your professional life as currently being dissatisfying. Your desire to use drugs may be the result of your dissatisfaction with your career and, correspondingly, with other aspects of your life.You did not detail what the problem may be. It might be a minor problem or something bigger but without more information, it is difficult to know what might be wrong.People use drugs for various reasons but they often do it to escape reality. Being high “feels good” in the sense that they no longer have to think about or deal with their problems. Biochemically, being high is temporarily pleasurable which is another reason why people use drugs.Using drugs is not the answer to your problem. It only has the potential to make the situation worse. My recommendation would be to discuss this fully with your therapist. If you have already done so, it might be time to think about a different therapist. Some therapists are very skilled in some areas but not in others. Perhaps your therapist has simply taken you as far as he or she can. I can’t know any of this from such a distance but I do acknowledge the possibility that change might be productive. A fresh analysis of your situation might provide insight into what may be wrong.

My father was abusive towards my mother and I witnessed all of that when I was younger. I have passion for photography and recently, I’ve been trying to find a job in that field. So, I found one that’s part time and id have to work during some weekends. I am also finding a full-time job. I told him about it and showed him the page I found and at that time, he didn’t seem to like it and gave me excuses like my camera is just a basic one so how am I supposed to be giving clients that kind of quality. I told him that it was written on the website that they don’t really mind what camera I’m using and then he gave other excuses. I asked if he doesn’t want me to take on the job and he denied. I already suspected in the first place that the main reason he did not want me to have the job is that I may find a better guy than him and that we will have lesser time for each other since he too has a full time job. I also get mad when he doesn’t pronounce properly or has an obviously wrong grammar when he speaks to me or when he says ok to everything even when I say that he won’t be able to handle it (he would ask to carry my stuff when his hands are already full). We kept talking about the photography job that I was going to take on. He then said that he wants to take on the same job in that same company. I got really mad because that just doesn’t make sense. [/INST]  One issue at a time. First, something isn’t right with the relationship. Your boyfriend’s insecurity is very limiting and it sounds like he doesn’t have enough of his own direction in life and wants to do what you do, control you, and limit you. This is draining you — my guess is that is where the irritation is coming from. I would recommend some counseling because this is now a long-term relationship, and it would be important to untangle these issues before going forward.Secondly, the vivid dream sounds terrifying, and I can understand your discomfort. I would recommend you have a medical or if possible a psychiatric checkup about this. There are several possible reasons for this kind of image occurring, and the fact that it has now happened several times and is unwanted makes the evaluation important.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello! I am not very ardent in psychosis so I thought I’d consult. I have recently been doing this thing where if I remember an extremely stressful experience or I recall something I’ve been procrastinating (cleaning a room,homework,organizing emails etc.)/an embarrassing memory my mind feels as if it shakes and only focuses on those memories and I involuntarily (I don’t know how to describe it other as being possessed by the memories) lose control of my hands and they/my shoulders tremor (my fingers lose control and shake in the air in a motion like piano playing, and my shoulders jerk back and forth) and my whole body shakes until I push the certain memory away or focus on gripping a table/my phone and then it calms to only my fingers/hand twitching until I calm down enough to be level-headed. It’s psychically tolling and I am always mentally and psychically exhausted after calming. It is only a thing that has happened in the past year. It can also happen in random spikes, even when I am not breaking-down; as when I’m sitting with friends or out at the movies my hands will take control of themselves and tremor. I have diagnosed disassociative amnesia and schizotypal personality disorder but I can’t find these disorders being tied to these symptoms anywhere. I have only ever taken medicine/psychotherapy for depression symptoms when I was 11-12. Thanks for your time and information! [/INST]  Your symptoms are unusual. You might be describing panic attacks. It is also possible that you’re describing something else entirely.Panic attacks can be triggered by a memory, as you have described, and they can also happen seemingly randomly. Alternatively, it’s unusual to experience your degree of physical trembling during panic attacks.You should undergo an evaluation by a primary care physician. Ask your parents to assist you in this endeavor.If you are already in contact with a mental health professional, report your symptoms. He or she can determine if your symptoms are psychological in origin. Having both a physical and mental health evaluation will give you the best chance of determining the cause of your symptoms.

"<s>[INST] My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. The first 9 months he was very very romantic and sexually active, but then the spark went away. He stopped buying flowers and gifts and saying sweet things to me or even saying happy birthday or celebrating our anniversary and texting me. We broke up a few times for his lack of romance, but he wanted to get back together each time after a few months. But again, He wouldn’t say he loved me or anything. And it just gets worse. The last 2 months he refuses any touch or holding hands and even sexual activities. He says there is something wrong with him or makes excuses. Today I found out about aromantics that is a kind of asexuality. I wonder if he became aromantic or is he just depressed? If he is aromantic, is there something we could do? I am a very very romantic person. [/INST]  Thank you for getting in touch with me. While I am unable to diagnose your boyfriend, it does sound as though there is a bit of a disconnect with your relationship. Given that during the beginning of your relationship your boyfriend did behave in a more romantic and sexual way, it is unlikely that he is aromantic. I would recommend that you focus on your needs in a relationship.  If you choose that you want to try to work through this with your boyfriend, I would suggest having a frank discussion about the state of your relationship. It is also quite possible that the two of you express your affection for each other in different ways. I would recommend reading The Five Love Languages by Gary Chapman. Through exploring your love language, this will help you to determine if you and your boyfriend are still in fact compatible, or if you need to part ways.–  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m a really quiet 20-year-old girl. I don’t smoke, I don’t go partying. I moved to Canada a year ago and I met my boyfriend. He is amazing and I don`t really have anything to complain about him as a boyfriend. [/INST]  You won’t like what I’m going to say but it must be said: You are in no way ready to move in with your boyfriend. I think your obsession with his past is how you are telling yourself exactly that.You say that you are quiet, that you don’t like to party and that you are just about to start college. You’ve been with your guy for less than a year. My best guess is that you are clinging to this relationship because you are nervous about launching a new life at school.Furthermore, you are not as mature as you think you are. You worry about whether you are pretty enough and you have gone searching for pictures of your boyfriend’s exes. Those behaviors do not indicate maturity and positive self-esteem.College means new friends, new experiences, experimentation with new ideas and a developing sense of self. It is a difficult but very important transition for many young people. But it is an important time of self-discovery. All that will be minimized or even eliminated if you are trying to make a home and a life with your boyfriend.Being 7 years your senior, your boyfriend has already gone through that developmental transition. He knows who he is and what he wants. From what you told us, I don’t think he’s a “player”. I think he reacted in an immature way to his cheating girlfriend when he was young. If he has matured, he will understand that you need time to do the same personal work that he did.My advice to you is that you and your boyfriend take a big step back. By all means, enjoy each other’s company. But don’t be exclusive for at least a year. A 7 year age difference isn’t necessarily a big one, but this happens to be an important 7 years. You need to have the freedom to explore yourself and relationships before you commit to a lifetime with your current boyfriend.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello. My girlfriend has 2 boys ages 5 and 4. The 4-year-old is in a very big power struggle with her. He is urinating all over the house, shouts at her, and routinely disobeys. He can be physical at times with his brother and mother and me. She has tried spanking, praise, and rewards. But nothing seems to do the complete trick and he falls back into these cycles where he is super bad. [/INST]  I’m very glad you took the time to write. This little boy is highly distressed. The fact that he does well at school and with sitters suggests that the problem is with his relationships with his family members, not a mental illness.Although you’ve tried many types of discipline, I’m afraid that may be part of the problem. Inconsistent methods of discipline confuse kids. They don’t know what the rules really are. Often they then push the limits until the adults have finally had it. By then, the child has gone way too far and the adults end up doing and saying things they regret. Then things tend to simmer down for awhile — until the next blow up.There is more going on here than I can address in a letter. Ideally, you and both of the boys’ parents should go together to a family therapist/parent educator. Yes, together. I hope the three of you can put the child’s needs ahead of whatever tensions may exist among you. Someone needs to take a look at the whole picture to see what is driving this kid to such extremes when he is at home. Often things the adults in a child’s life think are not all that important loom large for a child. By talking to all three parental figures, a family therapist may be able to tease out the dynamics that are reinforcing the bad behavior.The fact that this little boy does well in other situations is a very, very hopeful sign but it won’t last forever. Please don’t wait another week or month to get the help you need to address his problem — both for his sake and for everyone else’s.I wish you well.  </s>"

The only thing any of the events have in common is the fact that I came very close to seriously injuring someone, and only a physical outlet was able to alleviate my anger. Please, if you could, tell me what is happening. I do not know and I don’t like not knowing. Thank You. [/INST]  I think you may have an anger problem. It does not necessarily seem related to PMS but you might find that your emotions are especially unpredictable right before menstruation.There are multiple ways to address this problem. One way is therapy. A therapist can help you to explore alternative outlets for expressing your strong feelings. A therapist can also assist you in understanding what is at the root of your anger.You also might want to consider enrolling in anger management classes. Check with local mental health agencies to inquire about what services are available to you. Many anger management classes and programs are quite sophisticated and effective.You could also read about self-help anger management techniques. Check Amazon, Barnes & Noble or your local library for books.When your anger becomes overwhelming you react with physical aggression. This happens in the form of breaking pencils. Physically releasing your strong emotions can be very helpful. A better alternative is exercise. It is a great physical outlet. Through exercise you could release much of your pent-up anger and frustration. Studies show that people who exercise have a greater capacity to control and manage their emotions than people who do not exercise.In addition to anger reduction and mood stability, exercise has other positive benefits such as weight control, increased energy and self-esteem. I am not suggesting that exercise is a “cure” for anger but it has the potential to neutralize or decrease the intensity of your anger.It is important that you make a concentrated effort to address this problem. You have come very close to physically injuring someone. Take it as a warning sign that you are on the verge of out-of-control behavior. If you had not restrained yourself, you could have been arrested and might be facing jail time.You have the choice and the power to positively affect this problem. Make the responsible choice and get help now before you do something that you may later regret. I wish you the best. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been feeling very lost the past few weeks and do not know what to do. My relationship with my girlfriend and family is getting more and more stressful and I don’t know what to do. [/INST]  I am glad you found the courage to speak up about your girlfriend and your anxiety. It sounds like there are a few things going on that have to do with your relationships with people and having difficulty making, expanding, limiting or keeping connections. I would suggest that since it is affecting you with your girlfriend, your family and your friends that the best approach could be group therapy. I would encourage your to find a local therapist (the find help tab at the top will do it) and look for someone who spcializes in groups. You may also want to look for someone in the American Group Psychotherapy Association.Group therapy can help you with the anxiety you feel from wanting separation, the desire to improve your relationships, and the desire to balance between your needs and the needs of others. I think it will give you the most direct help in getting what you want.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Recently, a friend went on about how much she enjoyed horror films. I’ve always hated them, but found myself unusually disturbed by her enthusiastic interest. It wasn’t that I was scared or found such movies gross, I simply cannot cope with the fact she could gleefully watch people die in horrific ways. This spread beyond the horror genre, to the point I completely stopped watching movies or shows and playing games, or really indulging in anything, that featured violence or death in any way. [/INST] People might be drawn to horror movies for the same reason that they’re drawn to roller coasters. Some people like the adrenaline rush associated with the aforementioned activity. Movies and roller coasters may be a safe way to experience strong emotions. It may also be simply a matter of preference or maturity. Younger people are particularly drawn to horror movies and that tends to change over time.Since you did not ask a specific question, I can only offer a general answer. If you don’t like certain types of movies, there is no reason to watch them. You may want to avoid vocalizing your opinion if you don’t want to risk offending horror movie fans. If someone asks you, and you wish to share, then perhaps you can tell them what you think. But if your goal is to keep friends and those friends are fans of horror movies, then you might not verbalize your view so broadly.You also mentioned that you had “several perverted sexual fetishes.” That information would have been helpful to me. If you would like to write back and ask a specific question, I will try to give you a more complete answer. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a man in France: In the past two weeks my ex girlfriend and I of 27 yrs have started getting along well, she is friendly and polite when I visit her. She responds to my phone calls and texts quickly and always makes herself available to me. She told me last night that she feels sad when I leave her to go home and that I should be staying at her apt but I blew it. I let her down once too often. [/INST]  I suspect your analysis is correct. Your girlfriend is pulling back to protect herself from further hurt.As you have discovered, it is far easier to lose trust than to regain it. All you can do is exactly what you are doing. Show her that you have indeed learned from your mistakes and treat her well. If you are consistent enough for long enough, she may risk opening herself up to you again.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi, I have been having problems with depression, but I won’t go all into that. I think I should see a therapist but I’m scared of therapists and not sure what to do. I want the therapy to be private but I have no one I would be comfortable being in there with. Is there a way to help me be more comfortable around them? [/INST]  Thanks so much for having the courage to write in for help. First, I want to let you know that feeling scared and uncomfortable with the thought of going in and sharing your problems with a therapist is very common, even with adults. Most people are a little reluctant to share things with someone they’ve just met, even in social situations. Over time, you’ll likely feel more comfortable as you develop trust with your therapist.Since you are a minor, a parent will need to be aware of your treatment and give their consent. That doesn’t mean they have to be in the session unless you want them to.Here a few suggestions to make seeing a therapist easier.1) “Get to know them” online. There are many online therapist directories where you can see a photo and read about the therapist’s approaches to therapy. If you need help finding a therapists you can click here to see an example on an online listing.2) Learn more about the therapy process. The more you learn about therapy, the less mysterious and scary it is. Here’s a great article about psychotherapy by Psych Central’s Dr. John Grohol. Therapy is a safe place where you can share what’s going on inside of your heart and head.3) Request a brief phone call. Once you and a parent find a few therapists that may be a good fit for you, ask to schedule a brief phone call to help put you at ease. You’ll be able to share a few details about why you’re seeking therapy, ask the therapist a few questions, and see how you feel about it.4) Remember it’s just a conversation. It may help to think of as just talking to another person who wants to help you sort out your thoughts and feelings, and who’s trained in ways that will help you feel better.5) Therapy is effective. Therapy for depression is very effective and most people feel a lot better after a handful of sessions. Feeling scared about meeting with a therapist may actually be a symptom of your depression.  I encourage you to talk to a parent or guardian to help you find a therapist and get an appointment.Take good care of yourself!Julie Hanks LCSW  photo credit: Dottie Mae </s>"
"<s>[INST] I met a guy on Facebook we began speaking and all was going well. we then decided to meet for the first time it was spectacular I fell in love with him instantly as he says he did with me. after a few days or maybe weeks we began dating. [/INST]  It seems to me that it isn’t the fact of the child that is bothering you. It’s that your boyfriend didn’t tell you himself about this very important part of his life.There are many red flags in his story: Why isn’t he paying child support? Why doesn’t he see his child? What does it mean that the mother doesn’t let him see his daughter? He may be sweet to you, but to me there are many unanswered questions about his maturity and responsibility. I would think much more of him if he were making a real effort to man up and take on his share of raising his child. It’s possible that your level of distress is that you also have some questions about his character.I think you tell him that lots of women are happy to be with someone who has a child. What they are not happy to do is to be with someone who lies by omission and who doesn’t take his responsibilities seriously. Since he has these character flaws, he isn’t ready to be in a mature relationship with you or with anyone else.You haven’t invested enough time in this relationship for it to be this painful to let it go. At 18, you have plenty of time to find a guy who is worth your love. I encourage you to take a big break from this relationship and let yourself be available for someone who is truthful with you from the start.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am 22, and just suffering from depression. I do not know what has caused my depresssion or if there is a cause, however I have done lots of searching within myself. I have found that I have strange dreams and nightmares. I have had a reoccuring nightmare of being intimate with my father, not always involving sex, but being intimate. When I have this dream I feel guilty and scared. Every time I have the dream it feels like the first time, but then I remember that I’ve had the dream before and I pretend like I didn’t dream it. I have never asked anyone about this dream, I am too scared. I am afraid that it’s just a dream, but I am more afraid that it may have really happened. I struggle with trust issues, and I always have my entire life, especially with men. I do not know if this ties into these dreams? I am starting to feel awkward around my father. How do I make this dream stop, but most of all how do I know if it’s more than just a dream? [/INST] To know what these dreams mean, I would have to talk in-depth with you about various aspects of your life. With few exceptions, it is difficult to interpret a dream or set of dreams without having more knowledge of an individual’s personal life. But, having said this I do have a few thoughts regarding your dreams based on the information you have provided.It is not uncommon for memories of sexual abuse to surface through dreams. For various reasons, these memories can be buried. One reason may be that the abuse was too difficult for a person to deal with at the time that it had occurred. The memories may be psychologically blocked through unconscious defense mechanisms, namely repression. This may explain why you do not have any conscious memory of this event. It is possible to forget events that did occur.Another reason you may have no memory of these events is that the abuse occurred when you were very young and it can be difficult to access these memories. Many people cannot recall much information about their lives before the age of four or five.The fact that these dreams keep occurring may indicate that they may be true. Reoccurring dreams are usually signals that important information is trying to be conveyed. Generally, reoccurring dreams are saying “pay attention, this is a problem or issue that needs to be resolved or dealt with.” It may be that a message is trying to be conveyed to you. In your case it may be that what is trying to be relayed to you is something about sexual abuse and your father.You also have very strong feelings associated with the dreams. This is another indication that the dreams may be true. Another sign that these dreams may be accurate is that, by your own observation, you have been struggling with trust issues regarding men. If your dreams are true, the sexual abuse could explain why you have had, your entire life, trust issues with men. It might also explain in part your depression. All of these aforementioned factors signify that you may have experienced some form of sexual abuse.You may never know if these dreams are true and accurate. But I would suggest that you pay attention to them. They may be trying to send you a message. The dreams may stop once you acknowledge that it is a possibility that the abuse occurred. It’s equally possible that the dreams may continue to reveal more of what may have happened. You, however, will not be able control your dreams, no matter how hard you try.Usually these dreams begin to occur at a point in an individual’s life when he or she is psychologically ready to hear them. This might explain why they are occurring now.I suggest that if you are having difficultly fully understanding these dreams or if you are having trouble handling the information that may be being relayed to you about your father, consult a therapist. A therapist can help you adjust to this new information and may even be able to work with you, using this new information, to address your trust issues with men and your depression.

"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: I have an overwhelming fear of home invasions. My house in the past has been broken into multiple times. Despite the fact that we now have an alarm system, dogs, etc. I still do not feel safe. This fear often keeps me up at night, listening for any noises or looking out for anything out of the ordinary. During this time i often experience panic attack like symptoms as well as extreme paranoia. [/INST]  No one can blame you for being afraid. You are not fantasizing a problem. Your home has been invaded — multiple times! It makes sense to me that you are anxious about it.It’s highly unusual for a home to be invaded multiple times unless there is suspicion on the street that there are drugs in the house or there is someone living there who is involved in things they shouldn’t be. If that’s the case, you need to explore options for getting out. Your school counselor may be able to give you some advice. There may be scholarships to a private school or an exchange program or a work program that you qualify for. Or you may want to investigate whether a relative in another community will let you move in for awhile.But — If your family has just had horrible luck or you are living in a high crime district that your family can’t afford to leave, your family has already done what it can to ensure that there won’t be another invasion. If that’s the case, you have to figure out how to manage your fears or be miserable until the day you go off to college or move on yourself.I can make a few suggestions:I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. We have gone through an adoption together that was finalized in June ’14. I’ve been suffering from depression but things have gotten better everyday. My boyfriend suffers from manic bipolar disorder and there have been days where my depression has made that harder for him to deal with. But recently, things have finally seemed to become (a new) “normal” again and we’ve talked through a lot of the issues and feelings we’ve been going through. [/INST]  There are many dynamics that make your situation particularly challenging including your depression, your boyfriend’s bipolar disorder, your new adoption, your discovering his attempt at infidelity, and an overall lack of social support. Any one of those issues, by itself, is a major life challenge and you are attempting to deal with them all simultaneously. Your high levels of stress are most likely impacting the relationship.Counseling could be highly beneficial to you and your boyfriend. It could provide the necessary guidance for handling these issues. Couples counseling could help you understand the dynamics of your relationship and determine how you both may be contributing to its problems. Your boyfriend’s attempted infidelity needs to be addressed immediately and couples counseling could help with this.Ask your primary care doctor for a referral.

"<s>[INST] One month ago my 14 year old daughter texted me from school saying that my husband (her stepdad) had asked her to change her shirt in front of him while I wasn’t home, and that he had also came into the bathroom while she was in the shower and ruffled the curtain and said “let me see”. I was devastated because I never ever thought something like this could happen. He has moved out now, and has promised to go to counseling. My question is if families are able to come back from something like this or not, and also, if he gets help and apologized to her and I make sure all precautions are in place so this never happens again, if it’s horrible for me to expect her to be ok with letting him move back in. We have two sons together and I want our family to stay intact. He is an incredible person and provider. He has been very depressed since the passing of his father. He admitted to it and cried for a whole week because he feels so horrible for what he has done. I know on he inside he is a good person. I’m just blown away that this happened. I want to protect my daughter above all else. I’ve told him if he moves back in and anything like this happened again I would report it and he would lose his kids. He swears it was just a glitch and he was just depressed and he is very, very sorry for it and he would never do it again. He did not ever touch her, and when he asked that of her she said no, so he didn’t see her at all. It was mostly just words but I know words can be the most hurtful. I really just want to know if you think it’s possible for us to keep our family together if everyone gets some therapy and help. Thank you for your time! [/INST] While I am a big fan of therapy, I do not think this situation as you’ve describe it is on track. He cannot move back in first just because he feels bad and wants to change. This doesn’t honor your daughter’s needs. This also isn’t a time for some collective therapy with you, your daughter, and your husband. He has significant therapeutic issues in front of him that are not a quick fix.Endangering the welfare of your daughter is not a normal reaction to grief over his father’s death. He needs to stay out of the house, away from your daughter, and in therapy with an expert. Just like you said, you never imagined that he could do this — so you cannot make the assumption that he is okay enough to bring back into your home. If you are going to make an error, make it on the side of your daughter’s safety.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am a 21 year old female who has always been controlled by her mother, even now as an adult living independently. When I lived at home, arguments always ensued if I asked for permission to go out with friends and God forbid if I were interested in someone. Now that I live out of State, she calls me a minimum of 10 times a day and constantly wants to know where I’m at, who I’m with, what I’m doing and her reasoning is that “I’m so far away and she does it for my safety.” I’ve had enough and want to know how I can get rid of this toxic relationship that is hindering me from forming any relationships here in Arizona out of fear of her intermeddling. I have dealt with this my entire life and I thought that once I moved out and no longer depended on her, this cycle would end but it seems to have only gotten worse. She constantly gives me guilt trips for leaving her back in my home state and she never gives me credit for being a responsible and independent female. I feel like I always need to be proving myself to her to demonstrate that I am independent and I feel like I’m always on attack. I am desperate for help and need advice on how to repair this situation. Thank You. [/INST]  At this point in your life, you have the power to end your mother’s interference and control. I’m sure you know that. What you do not have the power to do is end your mother’s control and please her at the same time. You are uncomfortable with the idea of displeasing your mother. However, you will very likely never please her if you attempt to control your own life. Does she have the right to control her life? Do you have the right to control your life? Does she have the right to control her life and yours, while you don’t have the right to control your own life? Is it all right for her to control two lives while you control none?Ultimately, changing the toxic dynamic means that you will have to change the way you interact with your mother. These changes will include imposing boundaries and rules regarding your interactions. You talk to your mother 10 times a day because you answer her calls 10 times a day. You apparently give in to her demands. As a young child, you had no choice; you had to follow her rules. As an adult, who no longer lives in her home, you no longer have to follow her rules.When she calls, you don’t have to answer the phone. Nor do you have to provide the information that she is demanding. How often you speak to her should be your decision. That may mean only speaking to her once a day, once a week or not for months at a time. The choice should be yours.She is not going to like your new changes. She will likely be upset and attempt to make you feel guilty. The guilt trip only works if you allow it to. You must resist her efforts.Changing the way you interact with your mother will not be an easy transition. You will have to tolerate her being upset with you. You might think that giving in to her demands is more tolerable or easier than dealing with the unpleasantness of her being upset with you but that would be a mistake. Giving into your mother, and doing things her way, means that she retains control of your life.I would recommend consulting a mental health professional who can guide you through this process. You may not need many therapy sessions but having professional guidance would be advantageous. You have an established dynamic with your mother that is going to require you to impose major changes. Understandably, you may need assistance in restructuring your relationship in a way that allows you to fully develop your independence. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I started seeing a therapist at my college’s health center in September of my freshman year. We had weekly appointments set up and I felt like I finally connected with a therapist I liked and could trust and was able to start moving forward with some of my issues. (This is wrong and embarrassing to even admit to, but…) I was curious and googled my therapist’s name one day. After going through some search results, eventually I found her Instagram account and looked through a few pictures. It became almost a routine for me to check her page and see if there were any new photos she had posted–and this went on for the second half of my spring semester. I was always careful to always be logged out of my account so I wouldn’t like any of her posts by accident. When the year ended about a month ago and I moved back home, it was almost a comfort to me that I would be able to look through her posts even if I couldn’t have another therapy session until September. I know this is transference and it’s wrong but it became such a habit that I didn’t think much of it. Fast forward to about a week ago and I went on her page only to find her account is now private. I was terrified that she knew I found the account and was looking through her pictures. Now I’m not sure if we should continue therapy in the fall. I know school starts again in September and I shouldn’t be worried now, but therapy is such an important part of my life there and I can’t imagine not having the support. I don’t know if I should bother going back to see her..because clearly it’s strange when your clients are going through your social media. I don’t know for sure if it was even me that prompted the account to be private (I was always super careful), but either way I feel creepy and embarrassed by the whole thing. How can I stop agonizing over this for the whole summer…and should I go back to therapy? [/INST]  I am certain that you’re not the first person who has googled their therapist. Many therapists advertise and have profiles on the Internet, and they do this precisely because they know that people are researching them. It’s not unusual to want to research a potential therapist.You may be overreacting to what you have done. It’s highly unlikely that she knew that you were looking at her account. She likely made it private for some other reason. Perhaps it was related to professionalism. She might have realized that having a public account might be problematic in her work as a counselor. There are thousands of potential reasons why she made it private. In all likelihood, it probably had nothing to do with you.Yes, you should go back to therapy. You and she had a good connection and you should not let this get in the way. In addition, you stated that therapy is an important part of your life. That would suggest she was having a positive benefit for you. Ending the relationship over this minor occurrence would be an unnecessary loss.Finally, I would encourage you to talk to her about what happened. In all likelihood, this will be a nonevent.

"<s>[INST] My girlfriend and I were having sex the other night, out of nowhere she slapped, then punched, dug her nails into my arm then pressed into my chest as hard as she could. I was shocked… She jumped off me before finishing, although I think she was very close. I asked her if she was into hitting me, she said no, it was impulsive. We went to bed and didn’t talk about it in the a.m. Later the next day she texted me saying sorry I hit you. I told her if she wants to go down that road, it’s something we have to discuss before it happens. In the past she has requested that I slap, choke and pull her hair, but only when she requests it. We later talked in person, I want her to be happy sexually and I’m willing to experiment if it’s something she is into. I started questioning her with an open mind if she likes it, she said she hit me, then she felt bad… So she got off me and didn’t finish. However she said before hitting me, she was so raging angry at me that impulsively she started to hit me. She doesn’t know why she was angry at me, she just was. She said if she could have made me bleed, she would have. She doesn’t think it’s something she is into for erotic purposes, I told her if it is, don’t be embarrassed and let’s talk about it. [/INST]  Hitting and punching you out of anger is not only dysfunctional, it’s abusive. There is no legitimate reason for her behavior. It simply wrong and abusive.You also described her as being “quite controlling with our day to days.” That type of behavior is also abusive.It’s clear that her behavior is not associated with a kinky sex life. She explicitly stated that her behavior has nothing to do with sex and that if she could have she would have hurt you more than she did. That is not an appropriate way to behave in a relationship.Half of the time, your relationship is a “nightmare.” A good relationship would rarely be a nightmare. The percentage of bad times in a relationship should be very small.It’s important for you to rethink whether or not you want to stay in this relationship. Couples counseling could help you to make that decision. It’s important to come to an understanding about what might be wrong with your relationship and whether it can be saved.If your girlfriend is unwilling to participate in counseling, then you should consider individual counseling. The therapist will help you explore the intricacies of your relationship, examine the problems and help you to determine the best solution. Please take care. </s>"

[/INST]  I know this may be hard to believe, but therapists are typically trained in this sort of thing, and believe it or not it is extremely common. The primary vehicle for change is the relationship in therapy with your therapist. He or she becomes a corrective force and it is not uncommon for clients to fall in love with this corrective person. The cure? Talk to him directly about your feelings. Your history would seem to indicate that intimacy may be difficult in current and future relationships, because there was never an opportunity to have a good role model. Now you do. Talk to him about it. Don’t run away from it. This is an opportunity to help heal yourself through the relationship.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m 16 years old, and my mom has been depressed for at LEAST my lifetime, though I’m sure it has probably been much longer. Since I was little she has talked about suicide, saying she will only be alive until I am 18 – the earliest I can remember her saying that is when I was 7. Sometimes she is happy, goofy, and in the mood to enjoy life, and other times she is sitting on the floor, drunk and crying because her boyfriend is on a trip without her. She and my dad have been divorced since I was 3, and she blames him entirely for the divorce though I’m no longer sure that’s true. We have tried family therapy but I am scared to share my true feelings when she is in the room, and she constantly feels attacked or offended by everything that a therapist says. For example, when I was in individual therapy, she would yell at my therapist if she said that I might want to consider sessions more often, thinking that she was being called a bad parent. I would not consider her a particularly bad parent but I can see where my depression is being influenced by how she acts and what she says. Also, I almost feel guilty because I feel that my brother and I are the only reason that she has not killed herself yet, and she often acts very miserable and hopeless. I truly believe that if my twin and I had not been born that she would have committed suicide already. We do not talk about these things because she often just wants to cry and feels attacked if I bring anything up, and I strive to avoid confrontations with anybody. How can I make things work, at least until I leave for college in a couple of years? Thanks! [/INST]  Thank you for reaching out. I understand what you are saying and I am sorry that you have to deal with a depressed and emotionally harmful mother. Her saying she is waiting until you turn 18 to kill herself means that she isn’t making good judgements about your needs — and is trapped in the whirlpool of her depression. I would highly recommend you contact the family therapist and individual therapist on your own. Let them know that your mother’s threat makes your situation unbearable. I would also contact the child protective services in your state. They often have resources to help. You do not need to manage your mother’s depression all on your own.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Since I was a child I’ve experienced extreme changes in mood with no explainable reason behind them. Counselors have always explained it as a result from physical and emotional abuse as a child. I’m almost 30 now, married with two children and have every reason in the world to be happy, but I never feel that way. My temper/attitude seems to be getting worse every year. I’ve noticed a pattern that falls into play around the same time every year. (August – October) I become overwhelmingly upset and depressed with my life. Never anything in particular, just everything at the same time. I feel “something has to change,” and I end up making split-second decisions that affect everyone around me. Within the last 5 weeks, I’ve left my home where my husband of 10.5 years still lives, I see my children every 2 days, and I’m no longer able to enter my home which we’ve lived in and owned 8 years now. The pure thought of walking through the door causes me so much anxiety that I become extremely angry, which leads to violent behavior. I’m not able to pin-point a direct cause for these feelings, and in the back of my mind would love to return home. I just can’t force myself to do it. The worst part about it is that I don’t understand or recognize the issue or reason why. I’m constantly angry, but I’m never able to explain why. I feel like everyone would be better off if I were to just disappear. I don’t know what to do since I have no medical insurance, no money, and medications have never made a difference in the past. All of which ends up leading to overwhelming unexplainable anger. Why am I so angry all the time, if I don’t have a reason to be? Why am I unable to enjoy the little experiences in life and with my family without having irrational thoughts about breaking things and hurting people? I’m not a violent person. But I turn into one when I feel “an attack” coming on. I begin feeling extremely overwhelmed. It feels like there’s electricity inside me that needs to be released, and as the energy continues to build I “black out.” When I calm down, I don’t remember what I’ve said, what I’ve done, or why it even happened. But more often than not, there’s a mess waiting for me to clean up. It’s controlling my life, relationships, and my work. I don’t want my children to hate me or to be afraid of me like I was of my mother. I don’t want to turn into her. That is what has controlled every rational thought and decision I’ve made since the age of 10. It’s beginning to become harder and harder to prevent and control. What can I do? Please Help! (age 29, from US) [/INST]  I’m sorry that you are going through such a difficult time. It is very unsettling to not feel in control of your emotions or behavior. I’m wondering why you seem to be discounting the statements from past counselors relating your issues to childhood abuse? Working with victims of trauma is one of my specialties and trauma could certainly explain most of what you have written here. Post-traumatic stress disorder can linger for years and affect our lives in every possible way. It is time to get back into therapy and specifically see someone who specializes in trauma and abuse. I would also suggest that you look into a type of therapy called EMDR.  It has been shown to be very effective in helping clients heal from the effects of trauma.I know you stated that you have no insurance or extra money, but there are always options available. Most cities or counties have community mental health centers that provide services to those in financial need. Many therapists in private practice offer sliding scale fees. Most support groups are free. Do some research into what resources are available in your community, including looking into low cost health insurance.I know that you said medication hasn’t helped you in the past, but you might consider having another evaluation at this point in your life and to have a complete physical. Our bodies change over time and the combination of the right treatments can make a big difference.Don’t be a victim any longer. Take control of your recovery now so that you can feel safe in your own skin and feel like you have something wonderful to offer others, especially your children, because you do. You are worth it. You deserve to be happy. It’s time to dig in and get to work on YOU.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve been having multiple problems all my life but it’s only recently I’ve not been able to overcome any new ones. In the last couple of months when a tense or stressful situation has presented itself to me; my heart starts to race, my head get hot and light, my hands don’t stay still and I smile, make an excuse just to walk away. It’s gotten to the point that deciding which course for college I should choose or turn down is pushing me into panic. Everyone I’m aquainted with know what they want to do in the future and I haven’t the faintest clue. It’s sending me in fits of hysteria!! In the mornings I don’t want to get up because I’m afraid of being stressed out. It’s ruining my life. [/INST]  What you may be describing are panic attacks. Panic attacks are a form of extreme anxiety. Some of the symptoms of panic attacks, among others, include: heart palpitations, sweating, trembling or shaking, sensations of shortness of breathing, and feeling dizzy. Panic attacks do not last long. Typically only a few minutes.You did not mention the context in which you are having these attacks. The fact that you’re on the verge of attending college may have increased your anxiety levels, thus leading to these attacks.People experience panic attacks when they are feeling out of control. Perhaps your belief that everyone else knows “what they want to do in the future” and you don’t, is making you feel like you have no control over your life.For many people, ambiguity causes anxiety. They don’t like the idea of not having a definitive answer. It creates a high state of anxiety. In order to reduce this anxiety, an individual may make a choice prematurely, simply to end their anxiety, but this is a mistake. Premature decision making increases the probability of choosing incorrectly.The type of anxiety you are experiencing is common among high school seniors and first year college students. They don’t like not knowing what major to choose. They think about it over and over and then make a decision but that decision is often premature.It’s a mistake to think that you need to know what you want to do with the rest of your life at such a young age. You might think that you love photography. You take a class and realize that it’s not for you. That’s okay. You have just learned something about yourself. College should be about exploring your interests and the resultant discovery.Healthy people tolerate ambiguity very well. They realize that ambiguity is often necessary because we don’t know all the facts. At some point in your college career, you will have to choose a major, but you should not make that decision before you have to, before you have gathered as many facts as possible about what you want to do. Also, once you have made a decision, be open to change. Don’t be rigid and stubborn. Those characteristics are unhealthy and can lead to making incorrect choices and unhappiness in life.I would recommend consulting a mental health professional to determine if you are having panic attacks. Once a diagnosis is determined, the therapist will recommend a specific course of treatment. Anxiety is a highly treatable condition. With the proper treatment, you can overcome your anxiousness and be better prepared to make wise choices about your future. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello. I have become very worried about my mental state in the past months. I feel as if I have been becoming more and more dissociated. It’s very hard to explain. My brain feels foggy, fuzzy, and sometimes absent. My frontal lobe, to be exact, feels disconnected to the rest of my brain/fuzzy/hazy/heavy. My vision feels strange, it almost feels as if I’m looking at life through thick glass. I have been having severe anxiety attacks, where I feel as if maybe I am not real or there is an alternate version of myself that has done very bad things. Sometimes I sleep very badly because my body feel extremely on edge and heavy. Sometimes it doesn’t feel as if i am doing something, like I will walk into a room and not remember the walk from one room to another. Sometimes i feel as if I am floating or my body is not exactly in reality. I have full body tingles, shaking feeling. Sometimes I feel like everything is happening so fast around me and i am not a part of it. Voices sometimes seem very far away and uncomprehensible. I am very very afraid as I learned today that my cousin is schizophrenic. I am 18 years old and I take 40mg of Prozac for depression and anxiety. Please, please give me some answers. I am very scared. I haven’t felt like myself in ages. [/INST]  I would agree that your symptoms are concerning. Your severe anxiety attacks and insomnia might be major contributors to the problem. Research shows that even losing one night of sleep can significantly impair cognition. Eliminate the anxiety attacks and insomnia, and your symptoms might all together disappear.It’s important to undergo a thorough physical examination. Start with your primary care physician (PCP) who can refer you to a specialist, if necessary.Your PCP might also suggest undergoing a mental health evaluation and a sleep study. Medication might be prescribed for your sleep and anxiety problems.A physical examination is the first step in determining what might be wrong. Follow the instructions of your PCP. Don’t ignore your symptoms. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: For about 7 years now I can barely get through a conversation without crying. It’s humiliating and is uncomfortable for everyone involved. Anything can trigger it but I seem to have narrowed it down to three general triggers. All of these triggers are things that I normally would never give a second thought let alone burst into tears about. 1) Any large group activity – baseball games, choir performances, kids school performances. If a group is together and I’m part of it, at some point I cry. 2) When anyone shares anything the least bit sentimental. For example – a friend of mine was talking about her son’s kindergarten graduation. His teacher taught the kids the sign language sign for “I love you” so that the next year that would be their secret signal around the school. Cute right? Cute. She was telling me this and I burst into tears! To the point I couldn’t speak. This happens all the time. 3) Anytime I have to speak about anything spiritual. I’ve almost stopped going to church. I can’t talk about any of it – not even planning a simple kids activity without crying at some point. [/INST]  It must feel terrible to feel so out of control of your feelings. It appears that you feel the most vulnerable around the things you care most about.When a glass of water is already full, it takes only a drop to make it overflow. It’s as if your nervous system is already just about overloaded and then these important issues push you over the top.I do suggest that the first thing to do is to see your medical doctor to determine if there is an undiagnosed medical issue going on. There is sometimes a link between emotional symptoms and medical problems. Take a look at this article here at PsychCentral: https://psychcentral.com/lib/involuntary-emotional-expression-disorder/Another possibility is a medication side effect or medication interactions. If you are taking any medications, you should also talk to your doctor about whether they are contributing to your emotional sensitivity.If you are medically fine, then an evaluation by a mental health care professional is in order. Emotional symptoms are often the result of untreated anxiety and/or depression.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  I don’t feel anything. I have no attachments to most of the population. Other than about 15 people that I actually care about, the rest of the world could die tomorrow and they’d just be names on a piece of paper to me. Including my wife and children. I genuinely don’t care about them. I know according to society and psychology that should bother me, but it doesn’t. [/INST]  The one missing element in your letter was what may have preceded your feeling desensitized. You listed your occupation as “military.” Is it possible that your desensitization may have been the result of your military training or experience? Military training often involves the use of virtual reality systems. That training has been found to increase desensitization. It is also common for soldiers to return home, especially those who have experienced combat and war, and feel disconnected from the world.Desensitization involves the inability to feel emotions. It’s akin to emotional numbness. This may happen as a defensive mechanism. Think of a defense mechanism as a psychological protection system. They are involuntary and unconscious and are meant to reduce psychological stress. Desensitization is also a common feature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).There are multiple, evidence-based treatments for PTSD including cognitive behavioral therapy and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy (EMDR). You should strongly consider visiting a mental health professional. Your local Veterans Affairs hospital should be able to help you.Recent longitudinal studies have indicated that the majority of people experience transient mental health symptoms at some point during their lives. In other words, we all struggle from time to time. It is nothing to be ashamed of because it happens to virtually everyone. If you’re willing to seek treatment, you will likely experience a positive outcome. I hope that you will consider it. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Canada: I’m an 8th grade boy, I hope I won’t be judged differently or ignored because I am under 18. I have severe ADHD and sluggishness and I find it very hard to incline myself to work or study. I don’t want to lose my future because my grades are going down and i just brush it off and say “maybe next time.” I’m worried because this is also bringing down my confidence, which is one of my key traits and I want to be who I am and have a good future with good grades. Is there any way I can be helped? [/INST]  Of course there is. But it’s going to take some work on your part. The proper question to ask is, “Is there any way I can help myself?”We all are born with traits, talents, and, yes, deficiencies. No one is perfect. Part of maturing is accepting that there are things about us that we need to work on and then work on them.ADHD isn’t dragging your grades down. It is making school more difficult, it’s true. But what is dragging down your grades is that you haven’t taken charge of finding ways to work around the ADHD. That’s the challenge that every kid (and every adult) with ADHD faces. It’s not going to go away. There is no pill or operation or other cure to change it. You have to learn how to be a person with ADHD — just like a person who has a limp has to learn how to get around anyway.You need to keep “to do” lists and follow them. While doing homework, you need to put yourself in a study environment where you aren’t likely to be distracted. You need to come up with strategies or “games” to trick yourself into staying focused. (Like setting a timer for 5 minutes and seeing how many math problems you can do before it goes off.) There are self help books available that can give you options. (Search “Self-help for ADHD” at Amazon or Barnes and Noble websites.)Meanwhile, you also need to make life style choices that will maximize your success. You say you are “sluggish.” That makes me wonder if you are getting enough sleep and eating well. Are you limiting caffeine? Are you limiting the number of hours a day you spend on devices? (You shouldn’t be spending more than 2 hours a day that aren’t homework related on screens.) Are you getting 30 minutes to an hour of exercise every day? For you, these things aren’t optional. They are what will make it more possible for you to manage the ADHD.It probably seems unfair that you have to do so much stuff other kids don’t have to do just to get through the day. It is unfair. But I’m sure someone has already let you know that life isn’t always fair.Here’s the thing, though. I’ve had lots of kids with ADHD in college classes that I teach. They tell me that having to learn how to manage their disorder early on has helped them be the excellent students they are today. They are more mature and more focused than many of their classmates. Some go on to say that they can multi-task better than most people by using their shifting attention to good advantage. They get good grades. Those who have stayed in touch with me after graduation have told me they used those same skills to be successful in jobs and graduate school and even in their romantic relationships.So please don’t settle for having a diagnosis. Get busy learning how to play the hand you’ve been dealt in life. When you do, you’ll be much happier and more successful in anything you choose to do.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been taking paroxetine oral suspension for a month now after being diagnosed with depression and social anxiety. I started from a very low dose of 1 mg and then augmented by 1 mg every two days, so that now I’m taking 13 mg daily. As far as cons go, I have experienced a significant emotional bluntness, some nausea, and until recently an augmented feeling of drowsiness during most of the day. As for the pros, I’m a little less angry (and a bit more sad) and I’ve had less trouble getting asleep (but I sleep more, too much probably). [/INST]    It is time for a second opinion. You will need medical supervision if you decide to withdraw, and since your therapist has made his opinion clear you’ll want to get the opinion of another psychiatrist. This way you’ll have the advantage of two professionals reviewing the pros and cons with you.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi, I’m 18 years old and I believe I have anger built up inside me. I get mad at a lot of silly things. My family and my boyfriend tell me my attitude is awful, which I know is true. I yell once I get mad, I storm out of the room when someone is proving me wrong, and I always feel like they just are out to hurt me. I take everything very offensively. I get mad at my boyfriend if he doesn’t even text me back. But to be honest, every little thing I explode at doesn’t even really bother me as much as I show. I can yell and sock things and get so mad, but inside it doesn’t bug me. I don’t understand my problem. I hate being so angry. I just want the anger to leave me so I can be happy with my boyfriend. I am pushing him away. EVERYDAY we fight because I have something bad to say. I also am making my family hate me. They have stuck by me through everything. I just need some advice to find out why I am so mad, and how I can control it. Please someone help me. [/INST]  Thank you for writing in. It sounds like you express a lot of anger, but don’t always understand what you are angry about. It also sounds like sometimes you make more of things than you need to, possibly just for show. I’m wondering if you do this for attention or maybe because by now you think that people expect this kind of behavior from you, so you play the part.There are lots of ways to address anger issues. You can find some self-help workbooks, a support group, a therapeutic anger management class, take a yoga class, learn to meditate, find an individual counselor, as well as many other methods. However, I would suggest you first start with you. You need to spend some time looking inside to see what you are really angry about. After you have an incident in which you feel you lost your cool, try going to your room and journaling about the whole thing. Write down what happened, what you really feel about it, how you reacted, how you wish you had reacted, what the outcome of your behavior was, and what the outcome might have been if you had tried a different approach.You can also try some of the old tricks like taking a deep breath, counting to 10, or taking a walk BEFORE you talk to the person you are angry with. The good news is that you are young and you can fix this problem. It will take some time and effort, but it will be worth it and your relationships will improve dramatically. Good luck.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi I’m 15, female, 5’2 and 87. I’m completely obsessed with food. It literally rules my life. I stay up all night thinking and planning what I will eat the next day. I love making food for others but I never eat it. I find it hard to eat over 400 calories a day. I am on my feet every minute I am awake, I never sit down. I workout and exercise also. Not as much as I should. I cancel plans with my friends because I’m afraid they will make me eat or I will be confronted with food. I have constant urges to throw up but I never have. I also self harm by cutting. I cancel all plans with friends also because I hate being social. I’m a nice person, I just get nervous around other people. I hate staying the night at other peoples’ houses because I have certain routines that I do every day. [/INST]  I am sorry that you are suffering. You asked about whether you have anxiety, OCD, depression, or an eating disorder. I cannot know with certainty. What fundamentally seems to be driving your behavior is anxiety and fear.You also seem to lack self-esteem. You are constantly worried about what other people think of you. You worry that you are “bothering people” which may indicate that you consider yourself unimportant.You are not functioning well. Your eating or sleeping patterns are unstable and you are experiencing significant mental health symptoms, all of which are disrupting your life. You need help. Receiving help at this time is especially imperative because you admitted that you are considering suicide. People often consider suicide when they feel as though they have no other option or they don’t know what to do.I would advise you to see a mental health professional. You should also have a physical evaluation by a medical professional to determine what damage your body has sustained. Undergoing those evaluations will help to determine your psychological and physical health status.Accessing professional mental health treatment is the wisest and most efficient approach to your problems. Asking for help may be difficult but force yourself to do it anyway. There are many people who have had very similar problems, received help and their life has significantly improved. If you are willing to seek professional help, then you can expect the same, positive outcome. There is a great deal of hope if you are willing to seek treatment. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My wife continues to connect with men online but says she does it to bring back passion into our relationship. My wife and I are high school sweethearts and have been together for 30 years (married for 20). Sex has never been very important to her and we are intimate a dozen or less times a year. We deeply care for each other and I have suppressed my own sexual needs to accommodate her lower desire. We have two children and over the last several years have lost a bit of our connection. I have found my wife connecting with other men on social websites and engaging in flirtatious messaging that turns into sexual chatting and even phone conversations six times over the last couple of years. I have confronted her each time I have found out and she says it is innocent and would never turn physical and that she only wants to bring passion back into our relationship. These relationships are emotional affairs in my opinion and hurt very deeply and make it hard for me to trust and connect with my wife. I have also not witnessed her bringing any passion back to me. [/INST]  Thank you for your email. The emotional affairs your wife is engaged in involves systematic betrayal. Although you’ve tried to address the problem correctly, she continues to undermine the relationship and has failed to take adequate responsibility. It is important not to minimize this ongoing betrayal. Clearly, she is not giving your relationship the priority it deserves. It is probably time to move on from a marriage and family therapist — to a divorce mediator.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"

"<s>[INST] Often after I watch tv I would make up scenarios based on the story and live in them. I would pretend that I’m a character that I made up, and I would make up other characters and talk with them. When I’m bored or have nothing more to continue in that scenario I would make up a new one and starting pretending to live in that. Whenever I am alone or think that no one is looking at me I would pretend to be someone else and talk to people that doesn’t exists and whenever I realise that people notice me I would snap back to reality. However, I know that sometimes strangers do notice me talking to myself, therefore, I think that it’s starting to get out of control as I know that talking to myself is not normal and I tried to stop, but I just keep doing it. I am worried that if I continue this I might not be able to differentiate between reality and fantasy. [/INST]  I do not think that you are “insane,” but I do agree that if you don’t stop doing this there may come a time when you have trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy. The best advice I can give you is to take a look at what is so wrong with your life that you create these stories and characters to escape from it, then address the real problems.If you are feeling lonely, try to put yourself in situations to meet new people. Sign up for extra-curricular activities or take a class outside of school, such as yoga or an art class. Volunteer at your local animal shelter or nursing home. If you are bored, find ways to make your life more interesting and exciting. The more engaged you are in the here and now, the less time you will have to be lost in daydreams. This may take some time and practice because daydreaming and fantasizing may be habitual for you by now. But you can change these habits by redirecting your attention to something else when you feel tempted to get lost in your mind. And if finding a man to care about you is important, you need to spend time meeting new guys and going on dates, rather than just daydreaming about it.If changing these tendencies is too hard on your own, I suggest speaking to your school counselor or finding a therapist in your community to help you.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] My sister, age 57, is a BSRN, but not working. She has difficulty with working relationships. She has been married five times. Fired from her last job. For over a year she has been convinced “the government” is really the enemy. She thinks they are getting ready to confiscate everyone’s property and then make us “rent” our property from them. She is convinced they (the govnmt)is placing reflectors on people’s mailboxes so “they” will know who to “round up” for concentration camps. The latest “coup” she says will occur between Dec 21st and Jan 6th. Our family has been through several of these doomsday dates with of course nothing happening. We cannot convince her she is not thinking right. Physically, she is in poor health and close to 200 lbs overweight. She refuses to file for any kind of disability for fear of “the government”. (They are planning on taking everyone’s pensions). What can I do to help my sister see that all this is nuts. Do you have a name for this disorder? [/INST]  Your sister is suffering from persecutory (paranoid) delusions. A delusion is a fixed irrational thought or belief. People with delusions can’t be persuaded by facts. The believe what they believe. The content of delusions can be bizarre or non-bizarre. Bizarre delusions are just that – bizarre. For example, a person might believe that he is really from another planet. Non-bizarre delusions can sound a bit reasonable but are highly unlikely. Your sister’s idea that the government is out to get us is a good example.Delusional thinking is often associated with schizophrenia but it can also be a manifestation of an extreme anxiety disorder or the manic phase of bipolar disorder. People with persecutory delusions are often angry, irritable, and resentful. They are very frightened people. Some people with delusions can function pretty well as long as people don’t argue with their irrational thinking. I’m struck by the fact that your sister has been married 5 times. That means that she was able to find a partner 5 times! She must have periods where she settles down some.Your sister needs to see a psychiatrist. An anti-psychotic medication might quiet the delusions so she can live a more normal life. You won’t be able to convince her to see a doctor since she doesn’t believe that there is anything wrong with her. If she becomes violent or irrational, though, you could take her to an emergency room for evaluation.I hope you can get her to a psychiatrist. This is hard on her and on everyone who cares about her.I wish her well.  </s>"

Then i go to my room to cool down and they bust in and yell at me even more. I dont know what to do to get them to understand im going through a hard time in school and in my life and yelling is just adding to my stress. [/INST]  When people yell, they usually can’t hear each other! I don’t know why your folks are yelling. Maybe they don’t know how to communicate in any other way. What I do know is that it doesn’t help the situation one bit for you to yell back. You are only adding your noise to their noise and no one hears anyone else.You can’t make your folks change. You can work on changing yourself. And you know what? Often when one person in a family makes a consistent change, over time other people start to change too. Even if that doesn’t happen, you need to find better ways to cope and to manage conflict. Otherwise you are going to take this kind of behavior into your own relationships and repeat the whole thing. You already know what it’s like to be a kid in this kind of family. My guess is that you don’t want to do the same thing to your own kids some day.So — here’s what I suggest: Something about hearing your problems unhinges your parents. Maybe they can’t stand to see you unhappy. Maybe they don’t know what to do. Maybe it makes them feel like failures. I have no idea. What I do know is that it doesn’t do any good to argue with them. You need to find another way to deal with your problems and manage your stress.I wonder if there is a relative or another adult friend you can talk to. Many kids your age find that a favorite aunt or grandparent can be really helpful since they understand both the parents’ and the teen’s points of view. No relative? Well – once school starts, you could talk with the school counselor or at least ask where you might find some help. I did an Internet search of your city and found that there are many counseling services that offer help to teens and their families. The school counselor might be able to get your folks to think about doing some family therapy.Meanwhile, if you need someone to talk to, call the counselors at the Boys and Girls Town Hotline. People are there 24/7 to talk to kids just like you and to help them through the rough spots. Here’s their website.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi there, in places like these I go by the name Jack. [/INST]  You are only 16 years old. Everything that you’ve learned about life, existence, the nature of the universe, philosophical thought and everything else, not previously mentioned, you’ve learned in 16 years. Please bear with me. Let’s look at where you were, 16 years ago. This is also true for everyone born 16 years ago and for every other person ever born at the 16 year point in their life; you, me, and everyone else. Sixteen years ago, you were so dumb that you didn’t know your own name. They spent hours with you, trying to teach you your name. You were so dumb, you didn’t know what that big yellow thing was in the sky that hurt your eyes when you looked at it. You were so dumb, knew so little, that they had to teach you not to make little piles of poopy all over the house. You couldn’t talk. You had no idea what those strange sounds emanating from big people, meant. You would learn but it would take years. In 16 short years, you’ve learned everything that you know.You knew nothing and now you know a lot more, but there is a lot more to learn. That should be obvious to you. If you could get into a time machine and go back and visit yourself at the age of 8 and say to the 8-year-old version of yourself “hey kid you think you know a lot but you really don’t know anything. You think you know but you don’t. There is sooooo much more.” That 8-year-old kid would look at you like you’re crazy and never believe a word that you said because to him he knows everything. Everything he knows is all that he knows and so he thinks that there can’t be any more than everything. But he is very wrong. Healthy people will continue to learn about the nature of life, the rights and wrongs, the things that are important, the things that they were meant to do, until the moment of their death.You’ve talked about paranoia as if it is an acceptable thing but it is never an acceptable thing. Paranoia is by definition an unrealistic and thus false distrust of others. When you are 16, you will factually know beyond a shadow of a doubt that Santa Claus has the identical physical appearance of your parents and to believe that he looks any other way is wrong because it is false. After 16 years of existence you will know factually that no matter how hard you look in this world, you will never find a unicorn and it would be ridiculous for anyone to think otherwise. Do we need to talk about the tooth fairy? I don’t think so.Paranoia is always unacceptable because it’s false. It is a false belief. Don’t confuse paranoia with distrust. You should not trust everyone nor should you distrust everyone. There are people who are trustworthy and there are people who are not trustworthy. If you trust those you shouldn’t, you will not prosper in life. It will hurt you. If you do not trust those that you should, then you will not prosper in life. You must learn to trust appropriately, not too much or too little, and accept the fact that you will be off a little in the trust quotient but because you are only off a little it will not hurt you to any significant degree.I sincerely believe from the intelligence expressed in your letter that with the passage of more time and thus the acquisition of more knowledge, you will come to understand that hurting others is always wrong. You, yourself will not want to hurt others. Not because I told you not to, or you read it in a book but because you have personally determined it to be wrong from the knowledge that you’ve acquired studying religion, morality and the great philosophers.Would you agree with me, if I said to you that you are changing? How much of you changed since you were 14? How different are you now than when you were 12? Growing up is tough. It’s much tougher than almost any parent remembers. You need to find yourself. You need to find out who you are. You need to find out what will make you happy. You need to find out what you were meant to do and with time and hopefully a good mentor or two, you’ll do just that. The teen years and the early 20s are a stormy sea to transverse, especially the teen years.You know what boredom is? It is simply saying “I don’t like what I’m doing right now and I don’t know what to do that will make me happy.” This type of boredom, in your teen years, is both natural and healthy. It motivates you to find that which will make you happy. You are a unique human being. You are not your mother or your father or a combination thereof. You are completely unique. What makes them happy, may not make you happy. Love and respect them for the good that they have done for you and forgive them that which they have done incorrectly. Love them for trying and forgive them for falling short.I would recommend counseling. Your counselor will be your mentor. It’s a perfectly safe place to talk to someone who can take their advanced knowledge and share its applicability to you and your unique being. Shop around a little for a therapist. When you find someone it’s easy to talk to and someone you like, you found your therapist. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My boyfriend and I have been “together” since August, but on and off since we broke up 3 times. He has these constant feelings of insecurity, self doubt, feeling the need to compete (he visited me after work and said he was better looking than any of the guys there, for example; and today he was upset that his best friend was poking me on Facebook, and it made my boyfriend insecure). He overthinks really bad, gets really stressed out and handles it the wrong way. Two weeks ago he got really stressed and asked if I wanted to break up. Of course not. He’s been cheated on and betrayed and he knows friends and family who have also been betrayed in the past, so I get that he will have trust issues, insecurity, maybe even a hint of jealousy (or a lot of it?), but I think he may need help. I’m not sure. I love him, and when he’s not being upset, we’re fine. But he gets upset a lot; today he said he wasn’t eating because he felt “down in the dumps”. That worries me because over a year ago he was dealing with something else, and stopped eating, and went to a mental hospital. He said that after taking antidepressants, he eventually felt better and he hasn’t dealt with that issue again. The issues in our relationship have to do with him; he always says it’s him, something he needs to deal with, etc. His insecurity, overthinking, self doubt, lack of confidence or trust in anyway, the way he views the world so negatively and always expects the worst possible outcome, etc. Today he said he wants a break. I highly doubt a week-long break will cure this; I don’t want to insult him, but I’m not sure how to say that I think this is something he probably needs to speak to a professional about, and not deal with on his own. His negative thinking and overthinking is causing him far too much stress and though he’s been feeling like this less (or talking to me about it less), it’s making him feel worse. This is the first time he’s told me he hasn’t been eating and that worries me. I love him; what do I do? [/INST]  The history you’ve given me about your boyfriend sounds like he isn’t out of the woods. The moodiness, not eating, jealousy, insecurity, inflated sense of self, all sound like he may need some professional help. You aren’t going to be the one who can help him. In fact, you are going in orbit around his emotions. This makes for a highly unhealthy, difficult relationship. Since he wants a break I’d let him know that you agree and let him know he has to do more to heal himself than just say he wants to come back into the relationship. When people have told me they love someone who has continually broken up with them, keeps on doing so, and has a host of issues when they are together, I usually challenge what they mean by love. It tends to be that they are in love with that person’s potential, not their reality. I’d encourage you to think about this in your situation.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello! Since i was a kid i always had problems of making friends. I travelled a lot, went to summer camps in Europe, prestige ones, graduated a good university(bachelor degree). But i always had the same problem: at some point i was becoming a person no one paid interest to or even tried to ignore me. Sometimes it even turn to fights… When i turned 18 i have found a couple of very good friends and we were drinking every weekend. didnt pay attention to health issues and many times (about 10) drank till blacking out… couldnt control myself and felt completely happy while being drunk. I also was smoking marihuana for about half a year. Ive never had a girlfriend(not because i am an unattractive, but my behavior) . The second problem i face–i cant concentrate at all. Since i was very young i have lost like 10 cell phones, credit cards, wallets, driver license, laptops. And i really hate myself for this. I tried many different sports(triathlon, half-marathon, boxing) for building precision, watched 100-s of TED talks, took some courses in coursera but seems like it getting worse and worse. Friends and family call me lazy,moony etc. While studying i distract every 5-7 minutes. To enter this question i spend like 3 hours. But sometimes feel very energetic, enthusiastic for a couple minutes. I jump, shout and feel like a champion. And i cant really predict this or control. Especially when i listen to the music. I stopped drinking alcohol for 3 month and do not plan to continue. I believed that i can start a new life and become a normal concentrated person within 3 month of writing down all my activities in my diary and analyze it weekly. To sum up 4 hours a day on average i spend in a “focused mode”. But after 1 week of having a rest i returned to the previous version of mine. During these 3 month i cried a lot, punched myself in a face, tried to die while doing sports. Time goes faster and my mental power is reducing. I forget things more often and sleep more. In the period from 8 to 16 years old my daddy used to punish me physically and was shouting at me probably everyday. I really want to switch but seems like i cant find an appropriate tool for it by myself. [/INST]  These are complex issues that require the assistance of a mental health professional. Mental health professionals undergo years of rigorous training to treat these types of problems. It would be the wise thing to do.When choosing a mental health professional, it’s best to call at least five to 10 of them and speak with them about the issues with which you want help. Ask specific questions about your concerns such as what specific treatment(s) they would recommend.You can also ask if they’ve helped other people with similar problems. If you can find a professional with whom you have a strong connection, they would be your choice. You might choose one who specializes in ADHD and depression. You might also consider being evaluated by a psychiatrist for medication. Medication might help with your concentration issues.In the meantime, if you can, you should stop using drugs and alcohol. They will intensify your problems. Using these substances will make it more difficult to correct the problems in your life. Psychologically healthy people don’t use drugs or alcohol. It reduces the quality of their lives and causes problems. If you can stop, you should do so immediately. Trying on your own has not helped. It’s time to let professionals help you, something they do with success everyday. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am coming to this page because I have nowhere else to turn. My whole life my mother has been very impatient, belittling, and narcissistic. As a child, I thought her actions were normal but the older I got, the more aware I became of her behavior and how it really affected me as a person. My mom tells me that she loves me but doesn’t like me, she makes me feel guilty for medical bills after I get sick, and she can be physically abusive sometimes as well. She will start an argument, I’ll stand up for myself, then she will proceed to tell me that I’m “just weird” and my reactions to situations are “just plain weird” when she knows that hurts me deeply due to bullying as a child. She is also not affectionate or loving except for rare occasions. My mother also favors my younger sister and it is very evident. She comes off as such a nice person to other people so it is difficult to express how I’m feeling to others due to disbelief. I feel trapped. She will never apologize for her actions and finds ways to blame others. Is this a cycle of abuse? I want more than anything to love her for who she is and have a relationship, but I’ve found that I’m turning to other mothers to be more of a “mom” to me because I know that she will never change. I am a young mom myself, and I’ve needed my own mom more than anything sometimes but I didn’t have that. Instead she continues to judge my parenting, make me feel guilty for having her help, and is even impatient with my daughter. This feels like a RollerCoaster. This seems to be affecting me every single day and it has destroyed my hopes for being good enough for her and has significantly affected t self esteem. I hope I can get some insight. Thank you. [/INST]  I’m glad you have turned to this page. Growing up with a narcissistic mother put you in orbit around her emotional shortcomings. We know a fair amount about what happens in a household where this is the case.Perhaps the best book on this is a classic known as, Drama Of The Gifted Child. This book by Alice Miller details the unique emotional intelligence developed by a child growing up with a narcissistic mother. The long and short of it is that your mother’s emotional roller coaster becomes yours, and the way out of it is to recognize that your goal is not to please her, and then to grieve the fact that you mother was not what you needed for your emotional development. Stop using her as a barometer for your own well-being.As you stop using your mom as the barometer for your well-being you should eventually find ways to be more of yourself.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Well I don’ know where to begin. I grew up in a family that I believe was very critical and rarely encouraging. When I was 17 my parents were separated for a year (the year I was trying to get into college which has a huge test in my country and it is a very big deal!) and after they got back together my father was diagnosed with mesotelioma and passed away in just three months when I was 19. [/INST]  You bring up an excellent point for us to ponder. The earth is either round or it is not. It is either flat or it is not. The gun is loaded or it is not. The pitbull on the corner is either friendly or it is not. There either are sharks, that will eat you, in the ocean where you are swimming or there are not. You can either jump off a 10-story building, flap your arms strongly and safely fly away or you cannot. You can either safely catch a fired bullet with your teeth or you cannot.Are we entitled to believe in things that are not real? Well, in all of the examples that I just gave you believing in something that is not true would result in your death. Dying is a very heavy price to pay for being wrong. Would you believe me if I told you that every time one believes in something that is not true that person pays a price? There is always a price to pay. You are rewarded for interpreting reality correctly and punished for incorrectly interpreting reality. Abraham Maslow’s book on personality and motivation, which I consider to be one of the most profound books written in the last two centuries, explains the need to interpret reality correctly. He in essence says, only people who interpret reality correctly are mentally healthy and everyone else is mentally ill, to one degree or another.Science, and the research methodology of science, has given us all of the medicines that save lives and saved us from all of the medicines that take lives. Your smart phone, your allergy medication, your big-screen TV, the cancer medications that saved your mother, these are all things that have come to us from the scientific method.The scientific method says that the earth is round. Could it still be flat? Not if science is valid. All of the evidence tells us that the earth is round and could not be flat. Denying the roundness of the earth is denying all of science.Studying science and the scientific method will prove the validity of science and its determination that the earth could not be anything other than round. After talking to a science teacher or reading books on astronomy or simply studying the logic of science and the experiments that have tested it and proven it to be true, if after that one believes that the earth is flat then one is delusional.A delusion is a belief in something when all evidence proves that belief to be wrong and the contrary to be true. Delusions are a sign of an unhealthy mind and medication can indeed help the unhealthy mind to see more clearly. I hope I’ve answered your question or at least it provided a little insight or a starting point for you to do your own investigation. Thanks for writing. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m 19, I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I almost always avoid social situations, or any situation where I feel like I won’t have a way to leave if I start feeling overwhelmed. I don’t feel comfortable being around more than one person at a time, whether it is close family or a friend since childhood. I have carried my backpack almost everywhere with me for about 6 months. I keep my laptop, chargers, random stuff that I wouldn’t want to lose. I have worn the same beanie since I was about 16. I can’t leave home without it on. It makes me feel more hidden from everyone. I can’t bring myself to see a psychiatrist.. I want to know what might be wrong with me. I have been searching what seems like forever for an answer, how to be myself again. I care about everyone a lot, I’m not able to show it/tell them though. I can’t talk to anyone about what’s troubling me. Last time I tried talking to a close friend, we were never as close again. I haven’t heard from her in months. Im constantly thinking about the past. After I hang out with a friend, I’m thinking of all the things I could have done wrong, or said that sounded odd. I hear voices of friends occasionally. Sometimes I think I hear them quoting everything I am doing in a sarcastic voice. I don’t talk to them. Most of the time I can tell if I am mistaking a sound for someone talking. No matter where I am, even in my own room, I feel like people are watching me or have set up a camera to record what I’m doing. I haven’t taken a picture of myself in years because I’m afraid that someone is getting copies of everything I do (pictures, internet browsing, text messages, etc). Usually when I go somewhere new, I look around for video cameras set up or people watching what I am doing. I am almost always listing off all of the possible negative things people could be thinking/saying about me. Whenever someone laughs, I automatically think that they are laughing at my awkward walk. I’m currently prescribed Amphetamine Salts (Adderall IR) 30mg 3x daily. I have been taking anywhere from 2-5 a day though. I can barely get out of bed in the morning until I take one. I think I am just putting everything into my head, and convincing myself that something is wrong with me. Even if I am, it is definitely taking it’s toll on my life. Im pretty sure, if anything, I have something similar to Social Anxiety.. I was abused from newborn, up until 16. Then my mom divorced my dad because he wouldn’t stop the mental/physical abuse. The fact that it was my fault has stuck with me to this day. I also went through one of the worst tornadoes in history May 22nd, 2011. Since then, I’ve lived in a FEMA trailer park. I’ve started smoking up to a pack a day. I’ve never done anything like this before, so I’m sorry if it was too long, too much personal information, or anything like that. It’s 4 in the morning, work in 5 hours. Any advice would help so much. [/INST]  Without interviewing you in person, it is difficult to know precisely what may be wrong. There are two main possibilities. The first is that you have social anxiety. The second possibility is that you have schizotypal personality disorder. Individuals with schizotypal personality disorder characteristically have a great deal of social anxiety, tend to be loners, misinterpret situations, experience paranoia and have paranormal or peculiar beliefs.A complicating factor in your situation is that you have been displaced from your home. Not being able to live in your home may be contributing to your anxiety problems.You also mentioned that you have a history of abuse. That further complicates the situation and it may also be contributing to your current psychological symptoms. You blamed yourself but it is important to know that you are not to blame. The adults are to blame; you were an innocent victim.In your letter, you stated that you have been prescribed medication. That means that you have likely been evaluated by either a mental health or medical professional. I would encourage you to speak to that person about the symptoms you have described in your letter.The fact that you’re taking a medication that is not working is also important information that the prescribing physician needs to know. Ideally, you should be evaluated by a mental health professional and referred to a psychiatrist for psychiatric medication, if necessary. My main suggestion is that you need to contact the proper mental health professionals so they can properly assist you with your psychological problems. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello. I’m 18 years old and been wondering about this for some time, even though my sex is female I don’t really associate myself with a gender, I feel like I’m genderless instead. I was never a social person, even when I was young, and it got worse as of now. Even in high school I had a small group of friends (never passed 5) but I would only be with them during school. Once school was over I would stay home and spend my time alone in my room. Which in college (I have no friends there) I just return home and spend all my time alone. I also hate parties, large crowds, and would often avoid it no matter what. Not only that but I never really understood ‘friendship’ well (especially now). I often question myself on how people form friends. I don’t quite understand the bond people often feel. Also my friends had often said that I always appear calm and indifferent to everything (which is somewhat true). Since I don’t really express my emotions since I don’t feel comfortable around others and don’t know how to. Another things is that I already know that I won’t marry anyone or have children since I have no desire for that, in fact I’ll feel worse if I had to. I have no interest in the same or opposite gender, but that could be because I’m aromatic asexual. I’m perfectly fine with living by myself for the rest of my life, but others often say it’s wrong and I should change it. I also hate being touched by anyone, which means I never hug others and hate when others hug me, no matter if it’s someone I knew (family included). In fact I had multiple friends in school who had to move to another country but I couldn’t really feel sad about it, to me everything was still the same. I also won’t get excited if I meet someone I hadn’t seen in a while.  [/INST] A: Thanks for writing in with your question. It sounds like you have already done some research by looking up possible diagnoses for the symptoms you list here. I agree that many of the things you list sound like they could be part of Schizotypal Personality Disorder, but there are some other similar disorders that would need to be ruled out as well. If you really want more clarification I would suggest that you schedule a complete psychological evaluation including a clinical interview and standardized tests such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). You may be able to do this through your college counseling center but otherwise could ask your medical doctor or insurance company for a referral. Not all psychologists do testing so you may have to research who does.Finally, getting an accurate diagnosis is the first step but working with a therapist might help you develop your ability to form meaningful relationships and to identify and express a wider range of emotion. Medication might also reduce possible paranoid thoughts and perceptual distortions, allowing you to live a more comfortable life.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: Forgive me, this is going to be a very fragmented story…About 5 months ago my female therapist of a year and a half transferred me to a male therapist because I was a little obsessed with her. Nothing sexual. But I did look her up online and managed to find out…. probably everything about her. [/INST]  I don’t know enough about the situation with your first therapist to comment on her decision to transfer you. It sounds like she understood her own limitations and thought you would do better with someone new.Actually, what you are reporting is a “normal” experience some people have in therapy. What you are describing is an example of “transference”. At 17, it is normal for you to be struggling with developing your sexual identity. Whether or not you were sexually abused, you are living in a culture that can make that frightening. Therapy can be a safe place to explore your feelings about sex and relationships. It is not at all uncommon for clients to do that by processing intense feelings for their therapist.Do talk to your therapist. Share your letter and this response as a way to start. If your therapy doesn’t feel safe, first talk about it. Yes. Talk about it. If the therapist can help you feel safe, it is often in such moments of awkwardness, even fear, that the most growth can happen.Do remember that not every therapist is a “fit” for every client. If it still doesn’t feel right, consider whether you need to look for a therapist who you can work with.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My boyfriend and I met when his Uncle and my mother got married. We have known each other for years and recently him and I have grown closer and have started dating. We have been dating for 7 months now and my parents will not approve. We have tried sitting them down and talking to them and each of us talking to them individually and they just don’t want to hear it. It has gotten to the point where I have had to move out because of the way that they treat me. My mother can’t even look at me the same way. [/INST]  As you are already finding, your relationship isn’t a “little” issue to your mother. You wrote that you and your boyfriend have tried to talk to the older generation. What you didn’t tell me is what their objection is. If it is on the grounds of your being “related,” their concerns are irrational. You and your boyfriend are not related genetically. There is nothing morally or legally wrong with your relationship.But if they don’t see you two as a good match for other reasons, then it’s only respectful and potentially important to hear them out. They may see a truth or a partial truth that is hard for you to hear but still at least somewhat valid. Your mother may be doing only what mothers do — trying to protect you from making what she sees as a mistake. The question of whether you are “related” may be only a distraction that is covering up more important concerns. At least ask her directly to find out.If the issue is truly about a mistaken idea about the morality of dating someone who is related only by marriage, then it’s going to be tough to change the older folks’ minds. Issues of strong principle are often not very negotiable. All you can do then is be clear that you love and respect them but that you have to live by your own moral code, not theirs, and hope that they eventually come around to acceptance if not agreement. This is more likely to be successful if you stay out of arguments. There is nothing to argue about. Neither of you are going to change the other. All you can do is lovingly agree to disagree.My best advice to you is to be more openminded than the older folks are and to not draw such a deep line in the sand that you can’t reconcile at some point. Permanent cutoff from your family would be very painful for both you and your boyfriend. Give your mother and his uncle some time to get used to the situation. If it is clear that you two are truly a committed couple, they may soften over time. Should that happen, you want to be in the frame of mind that you’ll be able to forgive and move on.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I’ve been diagnosed with OCD since summer of 2013 after I had 3 weeks of horrible intrusive thoughts, causing me to cry constantly. I started at 50mg of Zoloft, though soon I had to up it to 75mg then 100mg. I’ve been doing okay with the 100mg, though sometimes I forget to take it. The reason it all started (What I believe…) is after seeing the movie “The Conjuring.” It messed with me, made me afraid of possession or going crazy and hurting someone I love. I still am afraid of these things, but not as much. I haven’t watched any scary movies, but I’ve seen previews and they cause my anxiety to go out the roof. Its 11:17pm right now and I am tired but I’m not laying down because I am still afraid, except its slightly different. Lately, I’ve been feeling like someone is watching me, like a ghost (Lately, meaning in the past week this started.) and I don’t hear any voices or anything but I’m so afraid that I could be going crazy or something, it scares me so much. It may be because I haven’t been taking my Zoloft constantly, not that I ignore it, I honestly forget to take it. I went to my doctor last Monday and everything was okay, what should I do? Should I make another apt? I’ve also had therapy, it did help a lot. Should I go back to therapy? Please let me know, I want a professional opinion before I freak even more out. I’ve been reading too many things on the internet about “Am I insane? Am I crazy? Are ghost real? Am I being haunted?” Thank you. [/INST]  Highly sensitive people are often highly suggestible. That means you’re the kind of person who absorbs distressing ideas more easily than other people. So — get off the internet sites that talk about ghosts and craziness. Don’t go to scary movies or watch violent or scary TV shows. I even suggest you read the news, not watch it. You need to develop more “shields” before you can afford to put yourself in the way of disturbing material. So — yes, go back to therapy. Work on developing stronger coping skills. You already know therapy helps so why hesitate? In addition, watch happy movies and search the web for inspiring stories. Fill your mind with things that make you feel good, not freaked!As for the medication: Yes, you need to take the right dose at the right time every day in order to build up and keep a therapeutic level. You’re a smart young woman. Come up with a system so you won’t forget. If there are no young children around who can get into it, think about putting the bottle under your pillow so you are reminded every night or morning (whenever you are supposed to take it.)I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve felt empty and isolated for a long time. I feel as though I haven’t been truly happy in many years and will be stuck this way forever. I haven’t enjoyed my teen years like I’m supposed to. [/INST]  Thanks so much for writing in. How very painful to feel like you’ve never really been able to develop your sense of self, and openly explore and express who you are inside. Your parents’ marital instability and divorce likely didn’t help you to feel safe either. The dizziness and shakiness you described feeling during your junior year of high school sounds like anxiety, which is very understandable, given all of the stress and isolation you were holding inside.Have you ever worked with a therapist? If not, I highly suggest it. “Forgetting the past” isn’t necessarily the goal of therapy. It is possible for you to process your experiences and make sense out of them in a way that allows you to move forward in your life. Your therapist can also help you develop healthy relationships and explore the best way to come out to your family. The great thing about becoming an independent adult is that you can define your life on your own terms, and seek out relationships that support who you are, and who you want to become. If you need help finding a therapist who specializes in working with GLTB issues click here.  Also, check with the student services department at your university for support groups for gay students to help you know that you’re not alone, and to help you find groups who are struggling with similar challenges.Thanks again for your courage in writing in for help.

"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: I’m not sure if it’s just my anxiety, but I’ve been feeling like I’m acting differently even though I don’t have proof I am. I have been feeling a little more anxious lately, but I’ve been able to handle it. I have been experiencing some depersonalisation, could be because I’ve been living in a basement and I rarely go outside anymore or even upstairs. I might be depressed, and really I want to know how to get over that. I just hope this isn’t something worse. I just really want to feel back to normal and take control of my life again. I really don’t want to lose control of myself. That has been a fear of mine since I first got sick with anxiety a few months ago. [/INST] The best way you can take control is to pick up the phone and make appointments with both your primary care doctor and a mental health counselor. When there is a change in someone like this, I always advise a visit to the medical doctor first to make sure that the symptoms are not a consequence of a medical issue.If you are physically okay, the next step is to continue to take control of your life by seeing a mental health counselor who can help you assess what is happening psychologically and give you recommendations for how to get out of the basement and back into life.No one can get you the help you need but you. I hope you will follow this advice immediately. The longer you wait, the chances are whatever is going on will only get more challenging.

I have so many mixed emotions. I feel as though i have engaged in behaviours that were previously uncharacteristic to a degree, well at least now they are extreme compared to before. I have no idea how to move forward as i seem to be spiralling down a very dark road. I also witnessed and experienced a very painful slow death and was pretty much the sole carer. i wonder if i may have PTSD on top of everything else i am experiencing. [/INST] Your emotional reaction to losing your husband five months ago is normal. You lost someone you love and that is very painful. Unfortunately, there’s no way to expedite grief. It must be endured, but it does not last forever. There are ways to make it less painful and it does get better with time.The problem is not that you have strong feelings; that is expected; it’s how you are attempting to cope with your strong feelings. Drinking has become your solution. It’s destructive to numb yourself with alcohol. It’s an understandable reaction, no one likes to feel pain but it is self-destructive. It can be corrected with counseling.Choose a therapist who specializes in grief counseling. You might also try simultaneously attending a grief support group. The benefits of group therapy are that you are with other people who know what you are going through and who can share their coping experiences.The fact that you wrote to professionals at Psych Central. shows that you are on the right track. The next step is finding the right therapist and grief support group. Contact your primary care physician who can refer you to the appropriate professionals. I am very sorry for your loss.

"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: The man I’ve been seeing (32) has been into rough sex for so long and told me his exs weren’t into it. I was open to it and so we had pretty rough sex often. Never dangerous. I told him I loved him one day and he got terrified and said because the sex got too rough it hurt him because it was too much for him to process so he had to numb his feelings for me to keep doing it. Later he said maybe I love you on another level, then a few hours later said I do love you, just not enough. Then kept whispering I love you the entire day which only confused me. He wanted to have sex again that night but it was so different, more emotional and loving. [/INST]  You are confused because he is confusing. I can’t begin to figure out what he’s about on the basis of what you’ve told me. It does sound like maybe he has separated love from his sexual activity. I’m going to hazard a guess that his exes didn’t agree with that separation. I do think he needs to figure himself out before he is in any shape to offer you a solid relationship.I can only suggest to you that you take a big step back. Before you get into another relationship (or continue with this one), please think hard about whether you are comfortable with sex, especially rough sex, without assurances of love. You absolutely should not capitulate to anything that makes you uncomfortable as a condition for being loved.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] from a young woman in Canada: I’m looking for advice on how to have a constructive conversation with my conservative Christian parents about the negative effects that my overbearing Christian upbringing has produced and discuss the fact that when/if I do reproduce I do not want this set of beliefs anywhere (at all) around my child until they are grown and can form their own opinions. [/INST] Please ask yourself why it is so important to you to try to change your parents. Yes, I get it that you don’t want your children to be unduly influenced by them, but you don’t even have kids yet. Your energies are better spent working on yourself.At 30, you are an adult. You’ve made your own choices. You have a life. You don’t need your parents to agree with your assessment of the damage the religion did to you. You don’t need them to accept that you have chosen a different path. You don’t need their blessing.Although you could have a deeper relationship with your folks if you could have an honest and open talk and if they could apologize, it’s not likely to happen.The way to have a better relationship with them is to stop fighting with them about something that is so central to their beliefs that they can’t entertain any challenges to them. Fighting about it is fighting a losing battle. Really. You don’t need to talk about it at all. If you want to spend time with them, find topics that are neutral and change the subject when religion comes up.Live your life. If you need to process your childhood further, find a therapist who can help you grieve the childhood you didn’t get to have and move on.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Okay so I’m 14 years old and I’ve had an eating disorder since November of 2012. It started out as just forcing myself throwing up after eating but I didn’t binge. then I started starving myself. I would only eat like 600-800 calories a day and I would still make myself throw up. I was also feeling really overwhelmed and suicidal and I was self-harming. But six months ago I stopped all of it because how worrying it was to my boyfriend and I didn’t want him to be upset because of me. But lately I’ve been obsessing over calories again and not eating enough. I’m not exactly starving, but I feel very faint at times and I only eat around 1000 calories a day. I feel panicked when I do. I hate myself so much and I feel so fat. because of my age I can’t get help without my family knowing and they’re very cold and uncaring. If they knew it would make it so much worse. So I was wondering if it is possible to recover without professional help? And if so how could I do it? [/INST]  Your behavior is very concerning. Eating disorders are dangerous, primarily because of the health consequences. You are starving your body of the nutrients it needs to function properly. The health consequences of eating disorders can include: tooth decay, muscle weakness, esophagus rupture, heart failure, osteoporosis, severe dehydration, and significant damage to your liver, among other things.I would not recommend that you attempt to recover from an eating disorder on your own. Eating disorders are typically not a “phase.” They require professional treatment.You don’t want to tell your parents about your problems because you fear their reaction, but I would encourage you to do so. You think that your family does not care about you but that is an assumption. They would likely care very much and want to help in any way they can. In some cases, eating disorders are a matter of life and death. I urge you to tell your parents. Give them the opportunity to help and support you.Another concern is that you were recently suicidal. Suicidal persons often erroneously believe that suicide is a cure for their problems. Suicidal thinking should always be taken seriously and treated by a mental health professional.If you do not want to tell your parents, then talk to the school guidance counselor. Inform him or her about your behavior and your suicidal thinking. The guidance counselor may be able to speak to your parents on your behalf, which might ease your anxiety about involving them. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that your behavior is insignificant or that professional help isn’t necessary. This is a serious situation. The sooner that you seek help, the greater the likelihood that you will overcome these problems. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: My parents argue a lot. My mom always complains to me about my dad. He’s an alright guy, but he is bipolar. He gets angry so fast for no reason, and we always have to be careful around him. He once wrecked his own room in a fit, then left me and my brother at home without saying anything. That was last year. It wasn’t this bad (I think) when I was younger, but I’m not sure. [/INST]  The simple answer to your question is “no”. It’s not normal to live in such a chaotic family. You all need serious help. Your dad apparently has a diagnosis but isn’t being adequately treated for it. Your brother is modeling after your dad (who is his role model for how a man should behave). That makes his meanness make sense but it doesn’t make it okay. It sounds like your mom is at the end of her rope so she is turning to her daughter for support. That’s understandable but it isn’t helpful. She needs to be doing what she can to get your dad into treatment and to get adult support for herself.You didn’t mention why you have moved so much. That does make things much, much harder since your mother and you probably have difficulty maintaining the kind of friendships that can provide support. It may also be one reason that your dad hasn’t received the consistent treatment he needs.By the way: It’s not at all unusual for a kid who has a difficult family and who moves a lot to read books a great deal and to think about fictional characters. It’s an important way to cope. Both books and movies can transport you to a better world for awhile.Your whole family needs some therapy. Your dad needs treatment. Your mom needs to be talking to a therapist, not her daughter. You and your brother deserve a more stable home. Family therapy coupled with psychiatric treatment for your dad would help a great deal.I hope you will talk to your mom about getting the family into therapy. You can’t be her therapist. It is unfair for her to ask you to be. You need her to be your mom. If your mom refuses, then do what you can to get some support for yourself. Talk to your school counselor about how to get connected with a therapist who specializes in work with teens.In the meantime, if you need to talk to someone, do consider calling the hotline at BoysTown. Don’t be be put off by the name. They talk to girls, too. Counselors are available 24/7 to talk to teens who are struggling. It is anonymous, free and confidential. The phone number is 1 800 448 3000. There is also an option for texting. Check out the website: http://www.boystown.org/.One more thing: You will be able to leave home in a couple of years — but only if you start planning now. Work hard in school to get the grades you need to apply for scholarships to college. Get a part time job. Be thoughtful about learning the skills you will need to get a good job after graduation so you can move out if you don’t go on to college. Save your money so you will have what you need to get an apartment and maybe a car. Set some specific goals for yourself. Working on them will help you stay out of the house and focused on your own future instead of on the family mess.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  I have been with my fiancé for two years now. I have gotten along with his family fine up until recently. His mother began emailing jokes to my fiancé and me and we noticed that there were a couple other people on the emails including an ex girlfriend, who he dated for a short period of time. My fiancé asked his mother if she was still in contact with her and she said yes that they email occasionally. He told her that it made him uncomfortable and thought that it was disrespectful to both he and I and that it would hurt my feelings. She responded very harshly by saying she wouldn’t be told who she could talk to. And that if I was that fragile than she would never be close to me any way because she would not want to have a relationship with someone that she needs to sensor what she says because of my feelings. She then deleted me from her email contacts and kept the ex. She said that she would also be a friend with another ex-gf, who had been very rude and nasty to me early on in our relationship, if she was given the chance. I felt like the response was totally irrational, mean and disrespectful. I felt extremely hurt. Her response hurt even more than the actual emailing itself. I had always been very nice and respectful of his mother. My fiancé has been very supportive and says that he would feel just as hurt and uncomfortable if the tables were turned and it were my mother behaving in this manner. All we wanted was for some respect for our feelings. It hurt to see this relationship flaunted in front of me and then to have my future mother in-law blatantly not care less about our feelings and choose to maintain a relationship with the ex and not her future daughter in-law. Any advice or perspective would be greatly appreciated!! [/INST]  I am sorry you are having so much difficulty with your soon-to-be mother-in-law. The fact that she lacks empathy for you and her son in these circumstances is a measure of her limitation. She feels affronted by both of you rather than able to understand that her behavior and attitude are offensive.That having been said I think it is worth it for the three of you to have a talk. His mother got her back up because she felt you were trying to control whom she talks to. My encouragement is to explain that you were hurt by her reaction to your request, and her saying she would have a relationship with another ex of her son’s. I agree her behavior is disrespectful. Let her know that both of you have decided not to accept being treated this way.Leave the ball in her court by letting her know that you simply won’t allow her to be hurtful to the two of you, but if she were interested in a relationship without the hurtfulness you would be open to it.Then make a conscious decision to detach from her. In other words, don’t try to fix her, but instead have compassion. My sincerest hope is that she will rethink her position and be able to have a better relationship with both of you.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, I’m 16 and I lack emotion and the emotions I do have seem to be fading away. I have no empathy, sympathy, very little remorse and no grief. I feel joy which sometimes is inappropriate to the situation, anger and irritation most commonly. I took joy when my mom was drugged at a bar because she’s an alcoholic and I felt as if she deserved that. I feel like everyone deserves what they get, and that they’re my pawns. At 14 I started to feel like no one was real like they’re all robots that are programmed to respond to my actions. The people that I feel are actually real consist of my partner, best friend and younger brother. I also lie just to throw trouble elsewhere or just because I can. I don’t take pleasure in that but I do it anyway and I’m highly impatient but I feel normally for animals and I’m vegan… Im responsible and very un-impulsive though. [/INST]  Thank you for having the courage to acknowledge this pain and discomfort. I believe it takes a high degree of bravery to identify and want to change the things that are distressing to us.Your mother’s alcoholism, poor parenting, and inability to protect you, along with the early sexual and physical traumas, are likely to be a significant source of your thoughts, feelings and reactions.You have taken a tremendous step forward by writing us here and I would encourage you to find a way to get an appointment with a therapist. If there is a direct way to do this — like telling a guidance counselor at school that you are having problems at home and would like their help in setting up an appointment — I would do that. If that isn’t possible, I’d arrange for you to see your physician and tell him or her about how difficult it is with your mother. This will help the physician help you get the therapy.Finally, I would also contact the local counseling centers near you that offer services to teenagers directly. Here is a list of those near you that can point you in the right direction: http://www.compassioncounseling.org/resources.php.You have taken the first step here. I’d now take the next step in dealing with these issues more directly.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] We live next door to a formally-diagnosed paranoid Schizophrenic who refuses to take his medication. He is in his early 40’s and lives with his mother. He has been unwilling/unable to get a job and spends his time manicuring the yard (7 days a week). Year by year, we’ve watched his paranoia slowly overtake him with “episodes” (involving the police) increasing in frequency. With each passing year, he has withdrawn into his parent’s house more and more, also making his mother a virtual prisoner in the process. On the rare occasion when his mom can speak to anyone (usually brief chats when she gets the mail) the comments don’t deviate from “he’s getting worse”. He has a variety of guns and, per his mom, now thinks that everyone “wants to do him harm.” While I’m primarily concerned with my family’s safety, the neighbors on the other side their house also have small children. It is only a matter of time before he finally snaps. What can we really do other than move away? We really aren’t in a position to do that and it doesn’t really address the problem – certainly for anyone else in the neighborhood. [/INST]  It is difficult for a layperson to judge the danger of another individual or situation. Your neighbor may be dangerous or he may not be. It is important to correctly determine the level of danger so that you may protect yourself and your family.The world is a dangerous place and there is no way to eliminate the danger. People are shot randomly while getting gas, walking down the street, in their homes, and even in their places of worship. No one would’ve thought that attending a public meeting with their Congresswoman in a shopping center or going to the movies to watch a Batman film were dangerous activities, but they were. Situations that appear not to be dangerous sometimes are. That is the world we live in.Research shows that individuals with schizophrenia generally do not pose a danger to others except in rare cases and when certain conditions are present, despite the general public believing otherwise. Individuals with schizophrenia are much more likely to do harm to themselves or to be victims of violence than they are to be perpetrators of violence.Your psychotic next-door neighbor may be no more dangerous than another neighbor who is not psychotic but who takes a particular combination of drugs and then engages in horrific violence. Likewise, your psychotic next-door neighbor may be no more dangerous than an individual who recently lost his job, is angry, suicidal, and wants to seek revenge on his employer and coworkers.If you believe that your neighbor is a danger to your family, then precautions must be taken to keep your children away from him. If that is not enough and this problem continues to concern you, then even if it means a great financial loss, you must move to a safer neighborhood. Those are ultimately your only options. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello! I would like to know some exercises or something I can practice to get myself out of this numb state of emotions. Last year was really hard for me (break up of a 4yr relationship, rape, loss of 2 good friends) and I was in constant pain and then I think it just switched somehow in me some kind of defense mechanism I think when I just stopped feeling at all. It was helpful and helped me a lot to sort out a lot of things. Now when it’s relatively a long time over and im supposed to get better I just cant. The bad thing is that i cannot express love or open myself to any bpdy because I just can’t feel what they feel… I imagine it as some kind of a barrier in me. Do you have any advice on how to get rid of it? It really bothers me because I’m a young person and I love life and my friends and I wanna fall in love sometimes etc. Thank you for listening :) (From Slovakia) [/INST] Just by writing to us you have begun to make the right kind of changes. Whenever there are so many difficulties the psyche will often shut down from the pain. It is an attempt to protect itself — but whatever protects also inhibits. The nature of reactions from trauma center around the brain trying to remind and warn or avoid and forget what has happened. The limitations you are feeling sound like they are a direct result of all the loss and trauma you’ve experienced. While it isn’t something I could diagnose from your email there are conditions that can arise from this kind of ordeal that can have a debilitating effect. One of these can cause numbness and feelings of being detached, isolated or disconnected from other people or yourself. This symptom collection can be triggered by any number of events, but is known to occur as a result of sexual violence, profound loss or death, injury — or witnessing of these things. When something that can overwhelm us happens that includes these type of experiences it is classified as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD.) In days gone by it was thought that only the kind of things very few people see would cause the disorder. Now, it is widely accepted that very common experiences, like a break-up with a boyfriend, can be enough to trigger similar symptoms. Here is more information about this.The descriptions below are not meant for you to diagnose yourself, but to understand more about what PTSD is, and how it can influence a person’s life. Here are some common symptoms of PTSD:It would be best to go to a mental health professional to get an accurate diagnosis. to help determine if you might benefit from seeking out professional help here is a brief online quiz. This can assure the treatment is properly matched with your symptoms.Finally, there are several approaches that have been successful with PTSD which fall into 3 general categories: Psychotherapy, medication, and self-help. The various forms of psychotherapy are:Often prescribed medications are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil) and sertraline (Zoloft), and the selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine (Effexor).Self-help recommendations supported by research are: exercise. acupuncture. Yoga, workbooks and social support. For an excellent discussion on these and other treatment option please read Margarita Tartakovsky’s article here.The important thing is that you are asking for help. This is an excellent start. I would go to a mental health professional to get an accurate diagnosis and while you are waiting to begin formal treatment you may want to take part in some of the self-help approaches.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I work as the director in a software company. I’ve recently hired a team leader and we’ve grown quite close, often speaking about matters outside work like our own lives, philosophical topics, etc. [/INST] There are several features of this scenario that are complex and layered. However, there isn’t a doubt about what to do and why. This isn’t something to pursue, contemplate or scheme on. No matter how you look at this, a metaphorical and literal “hands off” policy for you is the only way to go. Let’s review.You are married and her boss. By every possible measure you are unavailable and out of bounds, which may be what the attraction is in the first place. This isn’t the time to launch into how attachment theory works, but your blatant unavailability may be what allows her to be so open with you. Sometimes what attracts us has more to do with what we can’t have than what we need.Secondly, did I mention you’re married and her boss. The reason why sexual harassment is spelled out the way it is is that it is counterproductive, and in most places grounds for dismissal. Those rules are in place for a reason. Just to understand the seriousness of this: imagine this woman came to you as her boss with a complaint about another employee. That she was concerned they were getting the wrong idea and wanted you to do something official to protect her. Your direction and response would be clear. Your company’s policy would demand you respond. That is what will happen if you step over the line and she is uncomfortable.On the other hand, let’s say you ignore my suggestions and she is responsive to your overture. If you and your wife are really in the middle of separating you are even more emotionally unavailable for a true relationship. The turmoil of a divorce, the stress of managing your feelings and objectivity at work, and the perception of others during this time are often excessive overloads. Trying to manage a new relationship while getting a divorce, being the new person’s boss, and doing your job is not something that tends to end well.My advice? Take this attraction in stride. First thing’s first. Get your divorce. That takes one of the stressors off the table. As far as acting on this attraction? Not worth it while you have the jobs you currently have.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I get these things that I call “Ticks”. Ticks are the little things that make me snap. For example I could wake up fine, but then 1 little minor tick will happen and it makes me really angry for no reason and I completely shut down and depresses/angry the rest of the day. There are days where I will wake up and think its going to be a good day, but 5 out of the 7 days, I wake up dreading the day. I could be fine one minute and then angry the next. My family notices it but they just say “It’s just normal teen behavior”, but I just can’t control my reactions to these ticks! I also have been having concentration issues and its really caused by grades to slip. I’ve gone from an “B” student to a “D” student. Am I “Just being a teen”, or do you think I might have a personality disorder? [/INST]  You mentioned that you have “ticks.” “Ticks” can have a variety of meanings depending on how an individual utilizes the word. Your defined meaning of the word is not fully clear to me. I am not certain if your “ticks” refer to a thought, an emotion, or a behavior that makes you angry or upset.In the mental health arena, “tics” are repetitive, involuntary movements and vocalizations that are associated with Tourette syndrome. Tourette syndrome is a nervous system disorder that often begins in childhood.Because of the limited information provided, I cannot answer your question: Do I have a mental health disorder or am I “just being a teen? Generally speaking, if you have difficulty controlling your behavior, you’re having problems in school and you have lost your ability to concentrate, then professional intervention is suggested. Those symptoms may be indicative of a possible mental health disorder.My recommendation would be to have both a medical and psychological evaluation. If your parents are unwilling to have you evaluated, then speak to the school guidance counselor about your symptoms. He or she could help to clarify whether intervention is needed. In addition, the guidance counselor could speak to your parents about what course of action would be appropriate in this situation.If you would like to write back and provide a more detailed explanation of your symptoms, I may be able to better address your question.

"<s>[INST] I came out of a long 3-year painful and addictive relationship. It was exhausting that I lost a job. My partner was beyond comprehension and at times I was exhausted. This woman would be disrespectful to me and I could not ever break free. Finally she ended it on August of last year. At the time, I began missing her and came running for her a month and a week later. She expressed she no longer wanted me. I was beyond hurt but manage to move on. She suddenly reappears three months later, however I felt weird and could not bring myself to sleep with her. The entire problem is that she over stayed her visa and needs to marry some one. We would always fight over this. Well, we had another fight in New Years Eve and after seeing one another she broke up with me again. She said she was confused. I broke down again but then tried to move on. A friend then told me she was 5 months pregnant. How? If she was with me on Christmas and New years? I went into a rage and ever since I saw a counselor who helped me find my way again. Now a year later, I still have huge anger issues DIRECTED towards women. I find myself extremely angry and have so many questions, why would she do this to me? Was she trying to trap me with some one else kid? I hated my self for not sleeping with her, but now I see it was what saved me? I am over whelmed with ANGER at her. I called her to confirm with her when I found out four months ago. It was true, she was with child but she did not disclose anything only that it was true and that she was not getting married and I wished her well. But now I am BEYOND furious. Can some one lend advice? I wont ever contact her or hurt anyone, I am Christian, but this has left a significant amount of ANGER and emotional pain, and I find myself at the verge of an emotional break down. I am extremely hateful towards women. [/INST]  The anger you are feeling makes a lot of sense, but there are two sides to it. You are angry with her for betraying you, but you are also likely to be angry because you betrayed yourself. Being angry with her is because her behavior is a lightning rod. Whatever allowed you to stay in a painful, disrespectful relationship is likely to be fueling your anger toward her, but the real work is on figuring out why you stayed and dealing with that.The Stanford Forgiveness Project and the book Forgive for Good by Dr. Luskin would be a very good place for you to start untangling these angry feelings. As you read this book you may want to begin individual therapy. You can find a therapist in your area by looking at the find help tab at the top of the page.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] In the recent months, my mother and my father had a fight. Which ended in my father wanting to leave, but he didn’t because my mom begged him to stay. She told us that, and we (her children ) supposedly don’t know they fought. But as the months have gone by she has completely crumbled. She has many breakdowns on weekends when my father goes out. When she has these breakdowns, she talks in a really suicidal way. She tells us how she wants to die, how she feels guilty, how she wants things to go back, how she really just wants to disappear. She acts this way because since they fought, my father completely neglected my mom. He told her that she can’t love her anymore and that he can’t forgive her. So coming back to her breakdowns, it is really worrying to see her in that state, in which she cries for hours and hours until she calms down. As her children, who are young we can’t really do anything for her other than give her a shoulder. But it has gotten to a point where she cries whenever she is alone. We don’t know what to do anymore, because she has stopped eating or resting. My father’s harsh words towards her really don’t help her, because she still hopes he might love her one day. So we just are desperate, because we feel that hugging her is not enough to help her be happy again. So, I ask for advice because my mother’s condition really just gets worse as days go by.

My guess is there are a few of them. Let’s see where you are with other people when it works and what makes that comfortable. Typically when there is this kind of anxiety, or panic, there’s a flipside to it. When there is something so acute that is causing this kind of arousal, there are other situations that don’t. You want to learn what they are and find out the difference.I would make list of all the situations you’ve been in over the past month when you felt this anxiety. On the other side of the paper make a list of those times when you were with another person and felt fine or neutral. In particular look for the times when you actually enjoyed the engagement.

I considered him my best friend, lover and partner I know he is my soulmate as I’ve never felt like this before … he was my first and only love. He graduated before me and we had a long distance relationship visiting each other and always talking everyday for 6 years . It wasn’t easy at all …we went through a lot during that time … he had several manic and depressive episodes and I recognized all the symptoms. He has been medicated for years but every time the episodes occurs he would break up with me and breaks my heart. It happened at least once a year during our relationship and I always reached back. I always fought for us even when it’s painful and hurtful. I believed in him and us with all my heart and wanted to be there for him to support him We talked about having a future together and we were getting engaged. We are both from different countries … but it didn’t matter at all since they are neighboring countries. He talked to his mom and told her about us she wouldn’t accept me cuz I’m from a different country he told her how I understand him and supports him but she still didn’t care … in his culture he can’t fight his family to accept us. He can’t force me on him even thou there’s nothing wrong with me except being from a different country. He tried for several months until he started to hate his family and to resent them and he broke up with me few days ago saying we don’t have a future after 6 years he breaks my heart and shatter it into pieces. He has been experiencing some mood swings during that time feeling pressured … frustrated and overwhelmed. He still loves me and he knows we will be happy together, but he chose to give up on us … on our future together I feel devastated … hurt … empty and numb.

As you have found out, loving someone with bipolar disorder can be difficult. You have seen him go through some very serious swings over the last six years and you have taken him back even though he has hurt you many times.You asked if the current stress could have triggered an episode and the answer is yes. It sounds like he is torn between his family, his country and his love for you, which of course would be quite stressful. However, I’m concerned that it’s not just these issues leading to his most recent break up with you. Based on what you describe here, he has a consistent pattern of breaking it off with you when he is not stable. Unless he is able to find more stability in the treatment of his illness, I fear that this pattern will never change. Are you willing to go through these heart breaks for the rest of your life?I know you love him and have been very committed to him. Your loyalty is noble. But given the history and the current family challenges, I feel that it would be best for you to move on. Healing from heart break is difficult and can take a long time, but it is possible. Many people who thought they had found their soul mate have learned to love again just as deeply, and sometimes even more so. You deserve to be with someone who can give you as much as you give.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have a Dx of Bipolar Disorder and have had a few, brief dissociative episodes in the past (years ago before med compliance) in which I felt unreal, like I was floating and/or like time had stopped. However, something happened today that never has before. I was driving and very stressed for time due to work and I just became “unhinged” I guess. I don’t even have a vocabulary for it…I felt as if the universe was comprised only of the interior of my car, everything outside was a projection; I kept wondering what that sound was far off in the distance and realized I was screaming! My nails were scraping into the skin on my thigh and I’d been slapping myself in the face over and over again… my whole body was shaking uncontrollably and, when I realized what was happening and that I couldn’t control this, I started sobbing…I don’t know how I drove home and barely remember parts of the drive. Once I got home, I had a full blown panic attack and now, hours later, I’m still feeling “outside of my body.” I’m very frightened and don’t understand what’s happened.

My family has told me that it was out of anger, but whether that’s true or not, what I said to her was unacceptable on any level. Because of my anger issues, when my wife asks me a question or makes a statement to me, she feels that when I respond to her, I have a an attitude, or I am edgy in my responses.

I know it would be helpful to have support, but if you’ve hurt your wife with your angry episodes it may be a lot to ask of her right now. Please consider seeing a therapist to help you identify the cause of the anger and to get some practical help and support for learning how to deal with it productively. With some good effort on your part, you can learn more appropriate ways to manage your feelings and you can heal your relationship with your wife.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: Last year, I woke my wife up for sex. This has occurred numerous times throughout our marriage (by both parties) and there was never an issue raised. There were times (when she would wake me and when we were both already awake) when I didn’t want to have sex and never said anything because I didn’t want to disappoint her. Anyway, on the night in question, I unknowingly triggered a flashback to trauma which occurred years before we met that she had never told me about. She did not say or do anything in order to get me to stop. If I had known for even one moment, I would have stopped. It was months later that I even found out it was unwanted. Before and during the assault, I was hurt and felt betrayed by her and also thought I was being petty even feeling betrayed. I know that I should have spoken to her about that instead of trying to replace my negative feelings of her with positive feelings of providing her pleasure. [/INST] I’m heartbroken for both of you. From what you wrote, you have explained, taken responsibility, and apologized. Further, this was apparently a one time event and not a pattern of abusive behavior. Unless there is more to the situation than you were willing to share, I think you aren’t just dealing with what happened one night over a year ago. Sometimes a situation serves as a window to something else that is more difficult and serious. This event may have raised other issues that neither of you have perhaps even been aware of so they haven’t been addressed.You’ve tried to talk together about it to resolve it but have been unsuccessful. It is now undermining your trust and comfort with each other. I urge you to see a couples therapist for a few sessions to get to the root of the problem. If you could have done it on your own, you would have done it already. I’d hate to see a good marriage shattered because of a fundamental misunderstanding that could be corrected.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: Every few months I start feeling a sort of mix between deja vu and dissociation? Starting last year, I have infrequently had this feeling of being in autopilot and being an observer looking through my own eyes as something or someone else keeps going, whether it be driving or working or whatever I may be doing. My personality doesn’t change, it just doesn’t feel like me doing it. I start feeling a bit sick to my stomach, and vague, obscure memories of similar experiences start rushing back, almost as though I’m remembering bits and pieces of dreams I’ve had but previously didn’t remember, similar to the feeling of deja vu. It’s a very intense experience and I usually get rid of it by forcing myself to sleep through it, but I’d like to know if there’s more behind it, and whether I can prevent it or just let it run its course when it happens. [/INST]  It’s rare that a person can force themselves to sleep. Since you can, it suggests to me that you may be experiencing the consequences of a sleep disorder.A complete sleep cycle, from the beginning of Stage 1 to the end of REM usually takes about an hour and a half. That’s an important number. If an individual wakes up every hour or several times during the night, that person may be sleeping, but he or she isn’t getting good restorative sleep. The average person needs at least 4 to 6 complete cycles (6 to 9 hours) to be rested. If you aren’t getting enough sleep or if you have a sleep disorder, it may well be the cause of your deja vu-like experiences.If you are staying up so late you can’t get those 6 – 9 hours of shut eye, see what happens if you make sure you do for a few weeks. If the issue clears up, you’ll know it was caused by sleep deprivation.You will need to undergo a sleep study to determine if you have an undiagnosed sleep disorder (like Obstructive Sleep Apnea). If you think you are sleeping enough every night but still have symptoms, talk to your doctor about getting a study done. Most insurance policies will pay for a sleep study if recommended by a physician.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been in a relationship with a boy my age for about 3 years, i lost my virginity to him and have never been in a relationship with anyone else. He smokes a lot of weed, i have always hated it, but he still does it. If we have an argument he throws things, calls me names, swears and tells me to get out of the house. He also steals from me. He owes me about Ł70 now, his excuse is he cannot pay me back because he doesn’t have a job.He refuses to use protection during sex, and says i am selfish for not wanting to go on the pill. (i have tried it, i didn’t agree with me, made me feel really down)So every month i worry that i am pregnant. Every time he treats me badly i vow to myself that i will end the relationship, but when it actually comes to it, i back out; and give him another ‘last chance’ Why do i do this? Please help, thank you. [/INST]  You need to get out of this relationship yesterday. If you don’t, you are likely to end up pregnant, abused and then alone. You are staying with him because he’s a terribly bad habit.The teen years are when people figure out who they are and what kind of person they want to be with. Usually, this involves dating a number of people so you can learn who is good for you and who isn’t. Having been with him since you were only 14, you’ve missed out on important growing up time. Never having been with anyone else, he’s probably got you convinced that you don’t deserve anyone better. Wrong. You do deserve lots better than this.I know it will be hard. You’ve spent three years with him. Many young women stay with the wrong guy because he is the one they first had sex with. It’s as if they have to stick with a bad relationship in order to justify the sex. You don’t. You were young. You were naive. And you didn’t really see this fellow for who he is. He isn’t worth your love and your loyalty.Please say goodbye and make yourself available to someone who will treasure you and cherish you and make you feel good about yourself and the relationship. And, please, don’t fall right into another steady relationship. Take your time. Get to know a number of guys. Most important, first take the time to get to know yourself and what you really want from a partner.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m 17 now and should be off to university next year, but I’m so scared I don’t know if I should. I have a history of depression, really bad self-esteem, and I know I show many symptoms of OCD and anxiety, specifically GAD. The thought of going to university at this point terrifies me as I am worrying that all of my problems will get worse and worse to the point that I can’t cope anymore. In fact the only reason I think I’m dealing at the moment is because I have friends to talk to when things are getting tough, but I won’t have them when I go to uni. I just really do not know what to do at this point. I keep changing my mind between definitely not wanting to go (like now) and thinking that it wouldn’t be too bad. I admit I have spent most of my time in the not wanting to go category though. I have applied to go and got a couple of places so far, but even applying took a lot of convincing. I’m just so stuck and panicked. (age 17, from UK) [/INST]  I think the important thing to understand is that this decision you are grappling with doesn’t have to be a permanent one. You can proceed as if you are going to go study at a university and wait up until the last minute to decide if you really are ready, you can go and then decide you aren’t ready, or you could give it a try and find that it’s a great situation for you. There are ways to handle any decision you might make and you are putting too much pressure on yourself now to know your future. Your future can be fluid. You are always allowed to change your mind.The other important thing to know is that you can line up support for yourself ahead of time for if and when you go to college. Most universities have wonderful student counseling centers, as well as departments set up to help with all types of disabilities, including mental health conditions.I’m assuming that you have a therapist or psychiatrist since you are listing several mental health diagnoses. You need to be talking about your fears with your provider and develop a reasonable plan to help you with your decision. If you aren’t currently working with someone, by all means, please get help. Feeling better and developing healthy coping strategies are more pressing issues than whether or not you go to university.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] I want to have sex with her. I searched on the web and i found that i’m mentally sick. Am I really? Whenever i see her, i get arousal! She have very nice body, and she is sexy. [/INST]  I’m worried about the black and whiteness of your thinking. In other words, your thinking in extremes. In your mind, the only way to deal with this problem is to leave your home or to commit suicide. You’re upset and frustrated. Anyone who felt that those were their only two options would feel equally frustrated and upset.It is important to refrain from thinking in extremes. You don’t have to leave your home nor commit suicide. There are other options. Try to remain logical and rational.You have an urge but you have not done anything wrong. Urges are thoughts only. They are not behaviors or actions. Thinking about robbing a bank is not good, but it is not the same as robbing a bank. From what you have written, you have not acted on your urges. Urges can be controlled.You’re not the first person who’s been attracted to his or her family member. It happens in many cultures but it is generally considered taboo. Brothers and sisters are not supposed to mate.Your sister suggested visiting a doctor. Perhaps she knows of someone who could help. The doctor might be able to help you.I would recommend consulting a mental health professional. Counseling could help you redirect your sexual interests. You might be attracted to your sister, but that doesn’t mean you have to act on your behavior. If that’s a struggle, it’s especially important to seek counseling to control your behavior.Finally, try not to be so hard on yourself. You discovered that you might have a problem and now you’re asking for help. You’re doing the right thing. The first step in changing behavior is becoming aware that it is a problem. You have completed step one. By my estimation, you’re on the right track. Your next step should involve counseling to help you understand your feelings. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My boyfriend has a 13 yr who is very clingy to him. She’s had instances where she would call her mother while she is at our house and cry when she doesn’t get her way. This, of course, would spark an argument with between her and my boyfriend. Of course, when we first started dating she felt like he was spending too much time with me and my kids. So I felt the need to step back and let him handle that supposedly gain control of the situation. It seems to be there is an issue that arises every couple of months where she gets upset with him about something that involves me and my kids. I can’t stand when she comes around and I can tell he knows how I feel. I’m on the verge of calling it quits. I don’t know what else to do. [/INST] The 13-year-old has way too much power and it seems like as long as her needs dominate, they’ll be no stability and your relationship. I’d highly recommend you look for a seasoned marriage and family therapist with a who has experience with blended families. While I realize you are not married, talking with a therapist skilled in this area can let you know what to expect and the ways to navigate the situation.A blended family takes some finesse to manage. This blog written by PsychCentral’s own Tarra Bates-Duford, Ph.D., MFT has some wonderful suggestions. Chief among these are talking to your boyfriend about his style and what you would do in a particular situation. Understanding the differences in parenting style will go a long way to resolving and establishing an agreement as to how to approach joint parenting.You’ll also want to be realistic about how your relationship is affected by the challenges of being together. Don’t make the mistake of thinking the situation will get better on its own. It rarely does and acknowledging this can help tremendously in making the necessary adjustments.The negative feelings you already have are essential to deal with sooner rather than later. These negative feelings toward his daughter will have a tendency to spread to your feelings for your boyfriend and these type of feelings tend to grow arms and legs very rapidly. Getting these issues in front of a marriage and family therapist will be important to do as soon as possible. You can find a therapist in your area by clicking on the “find help” tab at the top of the page or checking out this organizationFinally, you may also want to find ways to learn more about his 13-year-old’s life and find ways to celebrate, show interest, and lean about her world. This, too can go a long way to softening and facilitating the connection.Getting an expert opinion on the situation with you and your boyfriend where each of you can express your needs is the first step. I don’t think without the help of a professional giving you some guidance that the relationship will have a chance to flourish.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m incredibly angry all the time, sometimes I don’t even know why. I practically live in the world I’ve made up. I’m currently in therapy for social-phobia but I’m too afraid to talk to my therapists about this. All my life I’ve been making up fantasy worlds, the earliest memory I’ve had of one I must have 3-4 years old and even then the characters have been killing other people or trying to avoid being killed. All my worlds have been incredibly dangerous, filled with people who have gone completley mad and there is no government or rules. I practically live in these worlds, I sit on the couch for 5 hours a day and just imagine them, it’s all I think about in school and on car-drives ( which is a daily thing usually we drive for 1-2 hours ). These worlds are all I care about I don’t currently have any friends, and when I have in the past I’ve never felt like I connected with them and eventually the friendship would just dissolve or they’d be weirded out by something I’d say. For example people usually are freaked out because I think I’m psychic, I just know when something is going to happen instinctively. Another problem I have is my anger. I get so frustrated by what other consider to be little things, a former friend recently began taking my lunch seat ( I’ve sat in the same seat everyday all year and she’d sit next to me ) and whenever she does I get so angry that I dig my nails into my elbow ( so hard that they nearly bleed ) it ruins my whole day. Whenever she and the boy who sits across from me get into a conversation I just feel completely enraged and can’t help but want to set her hair on fire ( though I doubt I ever would ). I’m furious that I have to go to school and have actually considered starting a fire there. I feel like no one can help me figure out why I have these thoughts and I just don’t know what to do. Thank you for your time. [/INST]  You are very fortunate to have access to a psychotherapist. I receive many letters from adolescents who suffer from a variety of mental health issues but who don’t have or may never have the opportunity to consult a mental health professional. In many cases, their parents “don’t believe” in therapy. In other cases, they may be frightened to request therapy. Many teens suffer in silence. Some live in rural areas where no mental health services are offered or their parents simply can’t afford the cost of treatment.I would urge you to utilize the mental health services you have access to. You may worry that your thoughts or fantasies may be too shocking. Perhaps you are concerned with how the therapist will perceive you if he or she knows about your fantasies. It’s important to know that therapists are trained to deal with all situations. They recognize that fantasies are just fantasies. What someone fantasizes about doing is not necessarily indicative of how they would behave. In addition, it is common for teenagers to fantasize. It’s actually quite normal.You have also mentioned that you struggle with anger issues. There are occasions when you feel the urge to harm someone or to light their hair on fire. You “doubt” that you ever would but you need to be certain of this. The most responsible way to handle these urges is to report them to your therapist. The therapist can assist you in developing constructive anger management strategies.The main problem, as I see it, lies in your reluctance to be honest with your therapist. I would strongly encourage you to report the information that you provided in this letter to your therapist. If you withhold important information, then he or she can’t assist you. Try to be open and honest. The more information you can reveal to your therapist the better he or she can assist you.I hope this answer provides some guidance for how to handle the issues discussed in your letter. Use the mental health resources you have available to you. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi there, I have a question regarding to my mom and why she appears to hate me in comparison to my brother and sister. I’m the oldest, my brother is the middle child and my sister is the youngest. My brother, my parents seemed to have focused majority of their attention on him which honestly wasn’t a big deal to me, but my sister who has caused so much grief on my mom even calling her the c-word and run in with the law and being physically violent with her still is treated with so much more respect than me. I’m not saying I’m perfect but I was a child of obedience, good grades, never swore, just desperately wanted to please my parents to no end, you get the picture. When I was a teenager she was physically and emotionally abusive with me, she went through a bad divorce with my dad and the death of her mother and sister so she did take it out on us, more so me and dealing with bulimia.  My mom does depend on me now for rides to work because she lost her license and does have type 1 diabetes so I’m the one responsible for her even though I want to move out and begin my life with my 7 year boyfriend. My mom doesn’t approve of us living together so I am afraid she will end our mother daughter relationship because she’s threatened it before. To this day she treats me horribly compared to my brother and sister even though I try hard not to start fights with her, I’m very quiet and passive which I guess she hates? And she walks all over me if my sister refuses to do something for my mom. Whenever I have tried to tell her how I feel she manipulates me into thinking something is wrong with me, she also seems to have a narcissistic personality problem but I’m not going to diagnose her. How can I begin my life without starting a war. An example that happened is that I expressed excitement over my future home that I offered that she can help decorate, she refused and said if I moved out she would never come over or talk to me but when my brother expressed wanting to move out she offered to pay his rent. Please help. (age 25, from Canada) [/INST]  I don’t think the problem is that your mother hates you. I think it is that she needs you too much. Somewhere along the lines the boundaries may have gotten blurred and she began relying on you more than taking care of you. Things probably shifted during the time that she suffered so many losses. When you talk about moving out or asserting your independence she probably becomes fearful and does whatever she needs to do to keep you close, and it appears to be working. It doesn’t sound like she “needs” your brother and sister as much so she isn’t threatened by their independence.You and your mother may have developed a codependent or enmeshed relationship and it will take time to unravel, but your mother will never be the one to initiate this change. It will be up to you, and it’s hard work.You obviously love and care about your mother and are most likely still seeking her approval, so just telling you to move out and start living your own life may be too much too soon, but it is ultimately what you need to do. You can do it as lovingly as possible and help your mom strategize other ways to get her needs met, such as transportation, or you can just rip the bandage off and make you your number one priority and let your mom figure it out herself. After all, she has been an adult a lot longer than you. Don’t sell her short.However, I understand that changing these ingrained patterns will take time and your self-esteem has been affected. Because this is hard work, I suggest that you enlist the help of a good therapist or find a local support group that addresses boundaries and codependency. There are also many self-help books on these topics. You deserve to be happy and live your own life, and your mom deserves to know you as a daughter, not her savior.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] My daughter (age 22) was recently diagnosed as bipolar. She had a major panic attack and was hospitalized for 2 weeks, which was very traumatic. After her release, she stayed on her meds and went to sessions with a therapist for a few weeks, but recently stopped taking all meds, and refuses to see her therapist. She seemed ok for a little while, but is not showing signs of mania again. If I say anything about seeking treatment, she accuses me of not understanding her and what is happening to her. She is very paranoid and worries about her safety all the time. I need to know how to talk to her and what to do to get her into treatment. Any suggestions?? thanks [/INST]  This has to be very, very painful. Help is available but your daughter is too distressed to take it. She’s too old for you to have any authority and too young for you to have confidence that she will figure it out without getting into big trouble. It feels terrible to sit on the sidelines and wait for the inevitable.All you can do directly is tell her that you love her; that you are worried for her; and that you are seeing signs that she is headed for trouble again. Emphasize that you aren’t judging her but that you want to help her catch the illness before she needs another hospitalization. Sympathize with how traumatizing the last episode was and about how hard it is to ask for help. As much as possible, it’s important to keep her in charge of what to do. When a person feels like their efforts to stay in control are slipping, the last thing the usually want is for someone else to take control away from them.Your daughter’s clinicians can’t talk to you about her care unless she will sign a release. (It’s certainly worth asking her to do so but, since she is paranoid, it’s unlikely she will.) They can’t even confirm that she is their patient. But they can listen. You can call and tell them that you understand the limits of confidentiality but that you want them to know that the daughter you believe is their patient has stopped taking her meds and is anxious and paranoid. At least she is then on their radar. Since they know her, they will understand whether checking in with her would be a positive move or if it would make her more paranoid.I also urge you to find a therapist for yourself, not because I think you are ill but because a professional can help you figure out what you can and can’t do. Further, you can then ask your daughter to join you in your therapy – which she might find less threatening than having you come into one of her sessions.When a child is ill, the parent also suffers. I’m sorry that you are both going through this yet again.I wish you both well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  Hello, I have been married 1 year and feel we should separate. My husband is from a different culture (middle-eastern) and I am american. He’s always gone.

His friends have really come between our marriage in more ways then one. His friends are very immature cussing about other people is what they do most of the time. [/INST]  Your husband is telling you both in actions and in words that he’s not ready to be a full adult and husband. He is hanging around with single guys who are younger and who are not married. He’s made it clear that his first loyalty is to the group, not to you. The friends haven’t come between your marriage. He has put them there.You end your letter by adding that he is threatening you. That should send up some red flags as well.None of this looks promising for making the marriage work. No matter how much you want to make a life and a future with him, you can’t do it alone. One person can’t make a marriage any more than one hand can clap. Some of what you are experiencing may be a cross-cultural clash but I don’t think that explains everything. He’s acting like a man who wants to be 22 and single, not married with responsibilities to someone else.Before you give up, I hope you will try to have a serious talk with him. Take the time to be clear in your own mind about what you will and won’t accept for married life. Then pick a time to talk to him when he isn’t pulled to be with his friends. Don’t answer his threat with anger or with threats of your own. Keep your anger under control so he doesn’t get defensive. Ask him if he has been trying to tell you that getting married was a mistake. If so, what does he want to do about it? If not, what is he willing to do to become a true married partner and what compromises does he want from you? His answers will give you the information you need to make a decision.It’s terribly sad to end a marriage, especially so soon. You married with love and hope in your heart. He apparently didn’t fully understand what it all meant. With a little more information, you can decide whether he will join in making a partnership with you or if you need to cut your losses, mourn the relationship and move on.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi. I wrote to you over a year ago about my loneliness, and being stuck by myself due to not having a driver’s license because of a vision impairment.

I told you I had a septic knee at the time and could not ride my bike, could not get anywhere, and had no friends. I also had brain surgery for an AVM bleed many years ago, which resulted in the visual impairment and other learning disabilities. I have never felt “normal” since then. Your advice was good, and led me to a Guide Dog School. I have been here for four weeks training with a great dog named Jimbo. He loves me, and I him. [/INST]  Who is to judge your worthiness? In this situation, it is the guide dog agency.You were evaluated for a guide dog and found to be worthy. You met the requirements as determined by those whose job it is to make such a determination. If the evaluators did not believe that you were worthy, then you would have been turned down. In their eyes, you are deserving of your new companion, Jimbo.It is their job to make that determination. You must accept their judgment. They judged you as being worthy of having a guide dog. By suggesting that you are unworthy, or not as worthy as someone else, you are in essence questioning their judgment.Recognize that your judgment is biased. By suggesting that you are not worthy enough, you are devaluing yourself. Some people overvalue themselves and some undervalue themselves. Based on the tone and content of your letter, you seem to have a tendency to undervalue yourself. It is important to appropriately value yourself in all situations. In this situation, the agency has deemed you as worthy and as such you should accept their judgment.The reality is you have been deemed worthy. That judgment should extend to all areas of your life. If you struggle with valuing yourself appropriately, then it would be beneficial to seek counseling. Individuals who consistently devalue themselves often struggle with self-esteem issues.Thank you for updating me on your situation. I hope that you can see the wisdom of accepting reality, can appreciate your worthiness and will thoroughly enjoy your new companion. Please take care. </s>"

It would be helpful to be evaluated by a mental health clinician. You may also want to educate yourself about the disorder. One book that I have found particularly helpful is titled I Hate You Don’t Leave Me. I believe it is one of the best books written about borderline personality disorder. If you do a search on Amazon.com you’ll likely find that you can buy a used copy of the book very cheaply.

"<s>[INST] My mum has had issues with alcoholism. She was diagnosed with severe pms which causes her so much stress that she turns to drink (and goes on week long benders). This has been happening for over 17 years. She is currently 43. During this time she gets extremely violent with me and my father, has trashed our house many times and fought with anyone- neighbours, police, etc. We have always suspected that it was more than pms, she’s practically an alcoholic and her behaviour isn’t cyclical as you would suspect from pms. Over time, her mental health has been getting worse. She has been on less benders in this time, however she is never happy. She is constantly stressed- even though there is no stress to worry about. She doesn’t take jokes, and we all have to choose our words very carefully in day to day life to avoid her going off. She has two other daughters under the age of 7, both of which she does not mother like a normal mum does. There’s distance and not much love. She has odd behaviour, like going shopping for groceries every day and buying things we don’t need. She associates herself with people who drink a lot of alcohol, so that when my father refuses to buy her any more she has someone to go and drink with. My father and I are under the impression that she may have an undiagnosed mental disorder like bipolar or schizophrenia (along those lines) and because her condition seems to be worsening with time, i wanted to reach out for an opinion. My family can’t live like this anymore. It’s unfair on all of us, and her. She is convinced that her issue is pms, so it would be hard to convince her to get help without premise such as advice in this forum. the drink will kill her one day, unless she stops. We want to live a normal life and have her back to the way she once was, if this means appropriate treatment for a potentially undiagnosed mental disorder, then so be it. Thank you for your help. [/INST]  It’s unlikely that PMS is her problem. It seems more likely that drinking is her problem. Whether or not she has a disorder is not something that I could determine over the Internet. She would need to have an in-person evaluation, to know if a mental health disorder is present.Family members, who have a loved one with a drinking problem, often utilize a program (in the United States) called Al-Anon. These are group meetings for friends and family members who have problem drinkers in their family. They provide great support to families in situations like yours. I don’t know if you have this type of program in your country, but if so, try to utilize this resource.Sometimes families stage an intervention, which essentially means that they plan a meeting where they ask their loved one to seek help or face a set of consequences. You can read more about interventions online. Ideally, you should consult a professional who specializes in substance abuse or a trained interventionist for guidance.Alcoholism affects the whole family. If your mother is unwilling to seek help, then you and your family members should consider individual counseling. It will assist you in dealing with your mother’s drinking. You can also learn about self-care which is important for your own mental health. Please take care. </s>"

Your efforts in trying to work it though on your own are important because it has allowed you to reach out.I encourage you to continue this process of reaching out and make an appointment with a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist. I am suggesting this for two reasons. They symptoms you describe can come from a variety of issues and these professionals can make a more accurate diagnosis than you can on your own. Secondly, they can recommend treatments that can help alleviate these.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] So I’ve had a rough time recently and I have depression and anxiety issues. I went over to a friends house last night and we were just talking in her room. Then we moved out into a little tree-pod thingy. (I don’t really know how to explain it better than that sorry.) After awhile we were talking about the way we were imagining a creature that had the head of a guy from the Russian Sleep Experiment and the body of the creepypasta ‘The Rake’. After that we really started to get freaked out. We closed our eyes so we didn’t look out the windows anymore, and we started to imagine it staring at us. I could almost feel it watching me. We both stopped talking and it continued to stare at me, but eventually it was just gone and I was in my idea of a ‘perfect room’. Someone was sewing my mouth shut, and I could feel the pain in my lips. I kept breaking the thread it was using but it just kept sewing it layer by layer by layer. Finally I couldn’t talk anymore, I couldn’t breathe. My hands felt numb and my arms were shaking. Awhile later I was conscious of my surroundings again and I could feel my mouth, I couldn’t move it open. I ran my hands over it and the thread was gone, and my lips were unharmed. I could still feel the pain and a tingling sensation in my ribs. My friend said she experienced something similar to this. (We both have depression and anxiety problems). We don’t know what to do, it felt so real and we had another one after it. Has anyone had something similar happen? I imagined myself into a panic attack? [/INST]  It sounds like the two of you frightened yourselves with the power of your imaginations. Anecdotally, many young people engage in similar “paranormal” activities. It happens so often that it could be characterized as a “phase.” These sorts of things can happen whenever one discovers the Ouija board or engages in other occult activities. It’s very common but ill-advised.Sometimes these games go too far. For example, a recent case involved two 12-year-old girls who read about a fictional character named the Slender Man on a horror story website. The two girls convinced themselves that this fictional character was real and that he commanded them to murder a young girl in order to pay him homage. They then stabbed a 12-year-old girl 19 times. Thankfully, their victim survived. The two girls are currently awaiting trial for attempted murder.The best thing to do is to stop engaging in these types of activities. It wasn’t a pleasant experience for either of you. You also linked it to your mental health problems. Voluntarily and willingly attempting to elicit negative experiences seems like a bad idea. It’s a form of self-destructive behavior.If you have depression and anxiety, then you should seek treatment from a mental health professional. Highly effective treatments exist for both conditions. Ask your parents to assist you with accessing treatment. There’s no reason to suffer with treatable ailments. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I do not believe that hate, resentment, or just a lack of caring are the appropriate feelings to have when someone is having a problem, and yet, I feel these types of feelings. Seriously, one time my mom came home saying that her gallbladder was acting up and it really hurt, and what did I do? Not even care! [/INST]  Your mom has been chronically ill with a variety of symptoms for a long time. What you are describing may be a version of what is called “compassion fatigue.” Anyone who cares for and cares about a person who is so consistently ill can get gradually worn down by it. They then start to have a negative attitude about both the person and the illness.In addition, you may be dealing with resentment that your mother can’t mother you as you would like her to. Instead, you are having to take care of your mom. That role reversal may be getting to you.It is normal for a young person to look forward to starting a life of her own. There is no reason to feel guilty about that. But for you to leave home and truly be free to enjoy your freedom, you’ll probably need to work with other members of your family and your mother’s medical providers to be sure she has the supervision she needs.In the meantime, it’s important that you take care of yourself by developing your own interests, getting out with friends, and working towards your future. I hope you are doing what you need to do to get the education you need to have a career and to support yourself. Earnings from a part time job while in school can be put in a savings account for the money you’ll need to rent an apartment and start an adult life.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Me and my sister in law are both pregnant right now. And I’ve been noticing the inconsistency of level of care about our baby from my fiancée side of the fam. This situation really has me depressed, and unsure what to do. for starters my sister in law and that side of the family has made it a competition between the babies, I don’t want it to be a competition. It always who can do what first. Then we notice that their side of the family doing all these things for their baby and not ours.if we happen to go visit them, and someone asks about our baby, someone always brings up the other baby and that the other baby “does it bigger” basically. And they are always all over my sister in laws belly, never once mine. They have literally cried over feeling her belly, never even touched mine once. No one ever asks how my baby is doing. I just want it to be equal, and I don’t know what to do. I need some serious advice. I don’t want this to continue when both the babies are here (which will be very soon), I don’t want my child noticing it either. [/INST] Thank you for explaining this situation. How unfortunate that this share joyous event is turning into a competition.The experience of being left out or ignored as part of the situation is what needs to be addressed. First, I would have a talk with your fiancé about what is happening and why. Does the family have a bias against the pregnancy because you were not married first? Is your fiancé on the outs with his family? Do they have a resentment against you for some reason? The key to understanding why this is happening is in understanding the reasons behind it. Of course, they may be superficial reasons or unconscious ones, but having a talk with your fiancé about this may be helpful in uncovering being slighted. This can also help decide the best mode of action for remediation.The fact that they are treating you both so differently may not be something they are consciously aware of. As a way of fostering a connection, I would include yourself into the mix and have your fiancé facilitate this. If they are touching her belly and not yours inviting them to feel the baby might be something you and your fiancé can offer. Join in the attention to your future sister-in-law and invite her to share time and information with you. Make yourself and your willingness to engage known to them.It way also help for you to take on a role where you are asking questions of your sister-in-law or other members of the family. You having this need from them may be part of what shifts the dynamic. Discussing this with your future husband can give you both a sense of connection during this, as well as support.Anxiety during pregnancy about, well, everything, is a well-known phenomenon. Here is an article you may find interesting about this.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a young woman in Australia: I care little about people other than immediate family and my partner. I’m very possessive of people and get angry (internally) if they show interest in/preference to others. This applies most to “friends”; (they would call me a friend but I don’t consider them that), my family, my partner, my students. [/INST] Oh my. My first reaction after reading your letter was, “This poor, poor person. Her self-esteem is so low she has become a bully.”  Only people with very low self-esteem constantly measure themselves against others in a way that makes them feel superior. Only those with terrible self-esteem carry this much need to pull attention to themselves in any way, even very negative ways.Overt bullies act up and act out. Your nit-picking or messing with your partner’s games are good examples. A covert bully is someone who does this secretly in ways that others aren’t aware of. An example of this is when you stopped caring about a student once he chose you over another teacher. Feeling small, you manipulate others and pump up your ego to feel big. As you are finding out every day, these tactics don’t really work. You still feel empty and without positive relationships.You need far more help than I can give you in an advice column. If you really want to get better and feel better, I urge you to see a mental health counselor. Take your letter and this response with you to jump start your sessions. Really. Please give yourself the gift of some treatment to set your life on a different and much, much happier path.I wish you well. </s>"
"<s>[INST] What’s wrong with me? i have no emotions. I have been through years of sexual abuse my parents are unaware of, growing up around drugs, delusional people, animal horders, poverty, and people walking out of my life. i have moved five times in six years, i havnt seen my first dad in seven years, and see my step dad infrequently. one of my dogs has died, im failing school, and i cant tell anyone why. i get depressed. last year, right before my parents divorced, i had terrible mood swings, and i would often yell at my dogs, and become cruel. during this time my mother would often snap at me becuase she was unhappy. i would cut myself (i have before, and have scince) in a cross hatching pattern on my thighs. my parents eventually found out. i also tried to stay out of the house as much as possible. i wanted to commit suicide, and have settled on a way i want to die. i did not because i am living for my parents, and i do not want to hurt them. i was unable to sleep for days at a time, and would then sleep sixteen hours straight. [/INST]  Given all that you’ve been through it makes sense that you would lose your ability to feel. What may be essentially happening is you are becoming numb to all the painful experiences you’ve endured. The numbness has become like a psychological defense mechanism. It’s akin to a survival skill. These mechanisms are in place so you’re better able to withstand the stress of your painful reality.You may also have post-traumatic stress disorder. PTSD is an anxiety disorder that can develop after experiencing a frightening event or series of events that threatens your safety. PTSD can occur as a result of sexual abuse. PTSD can make an individual feel disconnected or numb, something you’ve described feeling. If you have PTSD please realize that it is a very treatable disorder.You experienced sexual abuse as well as moving multiple times, not having your biological father in your life, a stepfather that you don’t see on a regular basis, losing one of your pets, failing school, being raised around drugs, poverty, and psychotic individuals. You’re also engaged in cutting behavior, experiencing depression and are considering suicide. You have panic attacks and you’ve recently been sexually harassed by a friend who took advantage of you.You’ve endured multiple challenges but never had the opportunity to address them in a healthy, therapeutic way. You need help and guidance. You should not be trying to deal with these issues alone. You may need to see a trained mental health professional. It may help if you told your parents about what you’ve been experiencing. You already mentioned that they don’t know about the sexual abuse. Do they know about anything else you’ve experienced in the past? What about now? Do they know about the cutting, suicidal ideation, or your panic attacks and depression? If they knew they might offer to help.I hope you will consider talking your parents. The things that happened to you are not fair nor are they your fault. You are a victim who is continually suffering. Ask your parents to get you help immediately. </s>"

Im sorry thus is very bad written but English isn’t my first language and i need the help this is eating me alive. [/INST] I am sorry this is happening to you. Unfortunately, there’s likely not much you can do. You should tell your parents how their behavior is negatively impacting your life. If they knew, perhaps things would change. If they won’t listen, try speaking to the school guidance counselor or another trusted adult. They may be able to help.If none of those ideas are effective, find other things to occupy your time. For instance, try to be with friends more. The goal is to insulate yourself from these deeply distressful situations, if possible.The bottom line is this: do what you can to positively affect this situation but realize that your power is limited. Once you’ve done that, you’ve done all you can. Sometimes, all that one can do is endure the difficult times and have faith that eventually they will pass. I wish you the best of luck.

"<s>[INST] Okay, so I’ve been talking to this boy for about 2 months now and as far as I was concerned everything was perfect. He’s totally successful, smart, funny, and everything I’m attracted to in a guy. Not to mention, the attraction is completely equal on both our parts. We’ve texted every day since we met, and even though we live 45 minutes away from each other, he still makes time to come see me at least once a week. [/INST]  During the first couple of months of dating, most new couples are obsessed with each other. Once that first blush of romance is over, a more realistic rhythm for the relationship sets in. You say this man is successful. That means he puts time and energy and focus into his work. He can’t do that and be totally available to you. For that matter, you can’t be successful at your work either if you are texting all the time.It’s not at all unreasonable for adults who have careers and interests to only text or talk to each other once a day or to see each other once a week (as an example). What is unreasonable is not talking about what is reasonable.You and your guy need to have a clear conversation about where this relationship is going and what you need from each other. What you see as only keeping contact may be making him feel crowded. What he sees as reasonable contact is, quoting you, “driving you insane.” There’s no right number of texts or talks or dates needed to make a relationship work. What is needed is an agreement that is comfortable for both of you.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a woman in the U.S.: I have a question about the fit of my therapist. I have been seeing my for about a year and a few months. I have questioned the fit the entire time, but I’ve really improved and and feel she is helping me so I always chalked it up to my issues as to why I am questioning the fit. [/INST]  Your symptoms have improved under her care so apparently the “fit” was good as far as treatment goes. But the larger context of your relationship is certainly questionable. Your therapist seems to be confused about whether she is your friend or your professional treater. Since she also shared the story about the other client who paid for a flight as a “thank you”, her issues around boundaries don’t seem limited to you. It is not considered ethical for therapists to accept this kind of gift from clients.Not charging you for sessions, over-disclosure of her own issues and that whole strange story about Wyoming are cause for concern. Further, it’s not at all unusual for a client to have difficulty with a therapist’s vacations. Usually, it is material for a session, not a source of conflict. I don’t think you are off base at all for being uncomfortable. I worry that you are so concerned about being fair about your own issues that you aren’t trusting yourself.Trust your instincts. There is something very wrong here. Regardless of what your issues may be, the therapist’s behavior raises concerns about boundaries and counter-transference that have nothing to do with you. You could try to talk to her about it, but since she has similar issues with other clients, I’m not optimistic that it will be a successful conversation. If it isn’t, my recommendation is that you thank her (verbally, not materially) for her help and transfer to a new therapist.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] When I was in high school I was depressed. Not seriously so, just a constant hurt that wouldn’t go away. I was prescribed some medication by my doctor and was seeing a therapist once a month. Medications didn’t seem to improve anything and was eventually taken off them. Therapy continued but I felt like I was being rushed, and that I was wasting her time which she could be using to help someone worse off than I was. I was having tremendous problems opening up. Eventually I became frustrated with it and stopped going. [/INST]  You have to force yourself to do what you know is right. It won’t be easy. It will be going against your long history of minimizing your problems. Asking for help will seem foreign to you. It may feel as though you’re doing something wrong but logically you must force yourself to receive the help that you should have received years ago.Perhaps your dream will serve as an important catalyst. In many ways, it’s disrupted your life. You focus on it and it’s causing you to think about things in a different, though not necessarily healthier, way. Your life now feels chaotic and out of control but it might be what’s needed to propel you into finally receiving psychological help.It’s time to do what you know you should have done years ago which is to receive professional help. I urge you to seek help as soon as possible.You’re worried your wife will react negatively to your getting help. People with depression tend to perceive the world through the scope of pessimism. This makes them prone to misjudgments. When you attempted therapy in the past, you likely misjudged that situation. You concluded that you were unworthy of help and ultimately decided to quit. That type of thinking hurt you then and it’s hurting you now.Your wife might be grateful that you finally have decided to receive help. Undoubtedly, your problems affect her and perhaps more than you know. You don’t think you would have the “strength” to follow through but I believe that you would. Help is available but you must make the choice. The choice is yours.You tried to wait it out. You gave it a chance to go away. You’ve been patient for 15 years. It hasn’t gone away. You should get help now. Perhaps the therapist that you had long ago just wasn’t right for you. It happens.People don’t choose to be depressed but they can choose to be helped.

"<s>[INST] Should I return to the UK to get treatment? In short, I had the typical bad childhood. My father was an abusive alcoholic who beat my mum and brother and was constantly in and out of prison. Both of my parents tried to kill themselves and as a teenager I would binge drink, take hard drugs, self harm and starve myself. [/INST]  You may have had a breakthrough of sorts: “I have been moving all over the world trying to get away from this but I think it’s time to stop and admit that I can’t do this alone…”You’re right. You can’t do this alone but that’s not to say that you have failed. You’re making the assumption that if only you would’ve tried harder you would’ve succeeded. Mental health professionals spend years in training, earning advanced degrees, learning complicated skills to treat mental health disorders. Without years of training and experience, it is immensely difficult to effectively treat mental health disorders.You also have a skewed view of your childhood. You described it as “typical” but there’s no such thing as a “typical” bad childhood. No two people, not even siblings who share the same household, have the same experience. What might’ve been traumatic for you may not have been traumatic for a sibling and vice versa. The way in which we are raised, our social class, level of social support, family dynamics, and many other factors, affect our personality, temperament, attitude and shape our worldview.You could read self-help books. Some of the best include those by M. Scott Peck, David Burns and Abraham Maslow. Maslow’s work is particularly important because he studied psychologically healthy people and described their characteristics. You could benefit by reading about the characteristics of self-actualizing people.If it’s possible for you to consult a mental health professional, you should. Along with your own self-help research, it could significantly improve your life. Never think that you are beyond help. The people who are the most difficult to help, are those who don’t want help and that’s simply not the case with you. Please take care. </s>"

Can you ask more for him than for any person who has ever lived? Every person who walks this earth will eventually die. Death is a part of life, but it does not have to mean the end. Many people, millions of people believe that death is just a transition. Many very intelligent people believe that, including doctors and scientists.Your love for your brother is a blessing. Enjoy every second of that in this world and perhaps in the next.It is not easy to accept the idea of losing a loved one. Focusing on the death of a loved one would understandably cause you considerable distress. It’s difficult to bear the thought of losing someone you love.You are attempting to focus on being happy but it doesn’t seem to be working. Your focus on the eventual death of your brother and your strong emotional reaction may be associated with your long-standing depression. Depression makes it difficult to focus on the positive aspects of life.It would be greatly beneficial to discuss these issues with a therapist.

When the councilor asked if I had ever feared physical violence at home was kind of an AHA moment. She also pointed out behaviors I thought were normal as abusive. That combined with my own research on emotional manipulation led me to the conclusion that a lot of the behavior at home wasn’t ok. The problem is that before I realized that I was able to control my emotions. Im not really allowed to ever be upset at home. I’m required to be the adult in the household all the time and I have the lucky job of being marriage councilor and therapist to my dad. which means he gets to rant about his life to me, usually topics like our finances, my moms emotional stability, their sex life, his health and approaching death, etc. I’m expected to give advice about these things. I’m 17. It’s too much stress. I;m never allowed to talk about my difficulties without being yelled at but expected to help my dad figure out marital issues.

"<s>[INST] Hi There, I really need help with dealing with my brother. He has serious mental problems and I think they are down to a lack of self esteem. Our dad (who still lives with us) is very aggressive but has never hit us, he just smashes things (although my brother is adamant that my dad kicked him and threw my mum down the stairs but he didn’t). My brother has ended up fearing my dad but won’t admit that he is scared of him and insists he would kill him if he could get away with it. My brother is 26, living at home and even though he has a degree is unable to get a job. He started to go bald when he was 19/20 and now just has no self worth and feels the whole world is against him. He is very self destructive, he used to cut himself quite badly and also took drugs for a number of years. He often breaks down when talking about our chilldhood exclaiming that we suffered abuse, (I am completely fine and feel although our dad obviously had mental problems himself, that our childhood was a very privileged one). I worry that if he doesn’t get help soon he will do something silly as he just hates his life and feels he is a complete failure, I find it difficult to help him as I disagree with what he is blaming his problems on. Please help as it is ruining my whole family, my mum is forever trying to keep the peace and feels it is all her fault and my dad ends up kicking off because my mum and brother are unjustly hostile with him due to a build up of issues which my dad thinks are sorted! Thank you. [/INST]  This is a very difficult situation. My concern is that your brother may act out violently toward members of your family. If he is actively using alcohol or drugs, then the risk of violence increases significantly. Do not hesitate to call the authorities if you feel that you or your family members are in danger.You disagree with your brother’s understanding of his problems. He views his childhood as having been abusive. He may have a skewed view of that time. You described your childhood as having been “privileged.” Perhaps you are correct and he is wrong. On the other hand, he may have experienced abuse. It is not unusual, and it is in fact common, for parents to treat each child differently. Also, children can live in the same home and have completely different experiences.Ideally, it would be best if your brother went to therapy. It seems as though he is dealing with many issues and his behavior is negatively affecting the family. If you have not suggested therapy, then you should.If he is not agreeable to individual therapy, perhaps he would be open to family therapy. In family therapy, everyone works together to solve the problems. The onus is on the family to solve the problem rather than on just one member of the family.If your brother is unwilling to change his behavior, then it is up to the people around him to change their behavior. That may not seem fair but you can only control your behavior, not the behavior of others. You and your family may have to develop a new set of rules for the home or the conditions in which you interact with him. A therapist could provide guidance regarding the best way to properly address your brother’s behavior. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have this issue where I need to know where people live. If I am with someone new, I feel like I cannot trust them, but if I know where they live, then I am calm and able to start the process of trust. (If they are trustworthy). [/INST]  Your insistence on knowing where people live might be a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is an anxiety disorder characterized by distressing thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions) that a person feels they need to perform in order to reduce their distressing thoughts. An evaluation from a mental health professional could determine if you have OCD.Each time you feel anxious about not knowing where someone lives, and subsequently seek out their address in order to reduce your anxiety, you strengthen your anxiety. It might sound counterintuitive, but by giving into your anxiety, in an effort to reduce it, you actually make it worse. The way to overcome this is to resist your urge to acquire a person’s address and endure the anxiety. Your anxiety level will increase at first, but it will soon decrease. Many people are unwilling to endure anxiety and to their detriment, seek ways to escape it.Let’s also examine your logic. In order for you to trust someone, you must know where they live, but I am not aware of any research that suggests trustworthiness can be determined by knowing where someone lives. It is illogical. Every serial killer has or had an address. Had you known their address you would have been no safer. It would have told you nothing about their trustworthiness.Trustworthiness is earned over time. When first meeting someone you don’t know if you can trust them or not. You don’t know them well enough to make that judgment. Generally, if a person demonstrates they can be relied upon, they are worthy of your trust.A mental health professional can assist you in analyzing your logic and correcting irrational thoughts. Left untreated, OCD tends to be a progressive disorder but early intervention can prevent that from happening. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I think I may have OCD, I’ve got intrusive thoughts I sometimes think about 1 thing in particular quite a while ago I heard about someone committing a murder while sleepwalking and while I don’t really believe that I sleepwalk it still bug’s the heck out of me. [/INST]  You might be correct about having obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). You seem to be experiencing some of the symptoms. Undergoing a psychological evaluation would be the best way to make that determination.All persons with OCD have intrusive thoughts. Typically, individuals experience these thoughts and obsessions and subsequently perform various compulsive behaviors in an attempt to relieve the discomfort associated with their obsessions.The heart of your problems might be the lack of trust in yourself. You believe that you might lose control and possibly commit murder. Fundamentally, the root of your fears may be the loss of control.It’s always best to focus on reality and that is particularly important when it comes to anxiety. People with anxiety disorders are prone to excessive worry about situations where there is a low probability of the feared events occurring. The probability of your developing a sleepwalking disorder and murdering a family member is extremely low. As a general rule, the lower the probability of something occurring, the less concerned you should feel.It’s important that you seek treatment with a therapist. You can likely receive treatment at your local community mental health center. Most community mental health centers offer free or sliding scale services. There may also be ongoing mental health studies at a nearby university. You might be eligible for participation in an anxiety study and would then receive free psychological treatment and or medication.OCD is a highly treatable condition. I hope you that you will make the effort to determine what services are available in your community. It will be well worth your time and effort. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My boyfriend and I have been off and on for three and a half years. He has cheated on me, and I have cheated on him. We have both tried to pursue other people, but we often end up agreeing that we should be together. He has cheated on me more severely than I have on him. (He was “intimate” with another woman; I kissed an old boyfriend.) I once made a fake profile on Facebook of a good looking young woman. I was trying to test my boyfriend. I, as the fake profile, was trying to seduce him. He ended up inviting “me” back to his apartment and said that we could fool around. This validated my suspicions that he would talk to other girls the way that he talks to me, even though he has denied that this is true. I caught him, and now there is no way that he could deny it. So, obviously there are a lot of trust issues between us now. He recently had a “friend” that he kept secret from me. He swears up and down that he did not have a romantic/sexual relationship with her. Though, he told me that she grabbed his penis when she was drunk one night, but other friends were around. Something in my heart tells me that he is not being honest with me. I am constantly catching him in lies such as these. These occur very often, to the point where I can predict that it will. I try to tell him stuff like, “I know that you will tell me some details now and then the important ones (like she grabbed your penis) come up in an argument or something later down the road. Please just tell me everything now so we can acknowledge that it happened and move on.” I have to say this every time a single girl comes into his life. At least I feel that way. My boyfriend also has anger, depression, and anxiety issues. Sometimes he can be very abusive towards me (mostly mentally abusive, but sometimes physically abusive, e.g. throwing a chair at me). He is in therapy right now and is working on those problems. The reason I came to this website was that he mentioned to me today that his therapist said that the jealousy is all on me, that I am to either be with him or not. She said that if I choose to be with him, I should trust him. Point blank. This concerned me, because my boyfriend is always trying to find a way to blame me for his problems and such. I didn’t think this was a fair accusation. He is constantly lying to me and doing things to break my trust. I want to be with him, but it’s hard to trust him. I am always completely honest with him, and I don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect the same in return. But am I all to blame for the jealousy and trust issues that I have within this relationship? [/INST]  I wish I could offer something more hopeful here, but from everything you have said this is a relationship that has the essential ingredient missing: trust. At every turn it seems you have found reason or evidence for not trusting him, catching him in a lie, or feeling suspect. Give yourself the benefit of being with someone you can trust. Relationships are always difficult, but they are impossible without trust.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From an adult in the U.S.: I have a question regarding my younger half sister’s odd behavior.  I’m curious to know if she has Cinderella Persecution Syndrome or Narcissistic Personality Disorder, or possibly both. [/INST] Does the name of a diagnosis matter? She is a difficult person. You’ve done your best to stay in relationship with her despite her terrible behavior. At her age, she is unlikely to change unless she somehow realizes how sad it is that she is missing out on having a positive mutually supportive sibling relationship.I can’t make a diagnosis, but I can confirm that she is a troubled person. I can also sympathize with you about how difficult it must be to put up with her.To answer your question about how to get along better with her: You may not be able to do any better than you are already doing. The key is not to expect anything from her. You know who she is. It’s unlikely that there will be any new information. All you can do is be reasonable yourself and not let her behavior get to you. If you are having trouble doing that, it might be helpful to see a counselor to get some practical advice.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: A few nights ago I was in my car near an overpass typing my letter to my family on my phone. I didn’t get out of my car, but i was coming close to it. I got it together and left and haven’t had any suicidal thoughts since then and have no intent of coming that close again. [/INST] Thank you for asking that question. I’m sure there are many other people who share your concern but didn’t write to us.Therapists regularly talk with their clients about suicidal thinking. If someone reports a story like yours to me, it doesn’t automatically activate a referral to hospital. What it does activate is a series of questions to help us both determine if the person is safe. Often the incident was a serious way to show both of us how deeply troubled the person has been. Most of the time, the person didn’t want to die but wanted (and still wants) the emotional pain to stop. Then we talk about that. Such sessions often deepen the trust between us and take the therapy to another level.If, on the other hand, we agree that the client isn’t safe, meaning that the client may make a more drastic attempt, then we will discuss whether and how a hospitalization would be helpful. (And, hard as it may be to believe, I’ve had more than one client write papers for school while hospitalized. They found that feeling safe in the hospital let them focus on doing the work.)If you are worried about how your therapist will react, you could ask her something like, “What do you usually do when someone talks about suicidal thoughts or even maybe thinks about doing it?” the answer may reassure you. It is likely that you will open a new and useful path in your treatment.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello! I don’t know what’s going on with me, but since a few months, I have been really enjoying looking at blood… I don’t know for sure when it started, but one evening I grabbed a pair of compasses and I stabbed the pointy end in my hand. I really enjoy looking at the way the blood pours out of the wound. I have done this several times in the past few months, but today was the worst one. I cut the skin on my arm open a few times with a scissor. I am afraid that one day myself wont be enough and that ill do it on somebody else… I have thought about cutting someone else’s skin, but I am too scared and I really don’t want to hurt anyone. I have also watched a YouTube video where a camel is being stabbed, and although I feel bad for the animal, I am fascinated by the amount of blood that’s coming out. [/INST]  There are two things going on. The primary events weren’t just the sight blood — it is the sight of your blood as the result of a self-inflicted wound. This is important as the episode with the camel followed the self-inflictions.The university in your hometown is one of the finest in the Netherlands, with a renowned medical facility. Use this nearby resource. I highly recommend you talk with your mom and dad about going there for an evaluation because you are hurting yourself in the process. There are various terms for being fascinated by the sight of blood, but these seem to be less related to your experience. The main thing is your self-harm.The fact that this bothers you and you do not want to hurt others is important. I am very glad you wrote us here at Psych Central and encourage you to be brave and take the next step of asking your parents for help in getting an evaluation. They may not understand the reasons why you do this, but they will want to help.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Lebanon: Growing up I thought what my dad used to do was completely normal and I had accepted the bad behavior. But by the time I grew up I realized that having someone mentally abuse us with harsh words and sometimes physical aggressiveness, it was too late. Recently he loses his mind, he spies on us all leaving devices hidden in our cars. He and my mother have been seeing other people openly, they can’t get a divorce because he’s gonna make my mom’s life hell if she leaves (has happened). He wouldn’t stop calling and showing up everywhere and threatening to hurt her. And if she stays it’s all the same, it’s horrible. He’s even dating her only best friend to make matters worse. And he keeps pointing fingers and saying that mom ruined his life while all along he was the one who was always losing his temper and threatening us and making our lives hell. He’s pretty much normally a very caring generous person, but he’s lost that bit because there’s like a little devil in his head sparking up a thing to get overly mad about … this is not even scratching the surface of what I have to say but I’ve tried taking him to therapy. He just won’t go and we can’t afford a good therapist. I need help because I’m on the verge of breaking down. 24 years of my life have gone by with horrific waves of madness. I just need to help him. I don’t know where to begin. [/INST]  Since you are 55, I’m guessing that your father is in his 70s. I suggest you give up on dad. You are not going to change him at this stage of his life. He sees no reason to engage in treatment. He isn’t likely to give up his controlling and abusive ways.Instead, focus on supporting your mother and yourself. Your mother probably needs both legal and psychological help. I don’t know enough about resources in Lebanon to offer direct advice. I hope there is a way to extricate your mother from the situation that prevents your father from tracking her and making her life miserable. She deserves to have some peace in her senior years if she wants it.As for you: I’m sorry that your father has been able to dominate your life for so long. You’ve done what you can for your father. Can you now just turn your attention to yourself? It is pointless to wait for him to show you the love and support that ideally a son should get from his father. From what you shared in your letter, the generous times don’t compensate for the abusive ones. His idea of a relationship is one of control, not love.It’s sad but true that not everyone gets the parents they deserve. Cultivate friendships with other men you respect and admire to fill that place in your heart. You may live another 40 or so years. You can choose whether the next decades are filled with more madness or peace. If you need support, do try to find a therapist or join an online blog. PsychCentral communities offer good advice and emotional support to their members.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] As I’ve been becoming older, I’ve been getting into arguments with my parents. But recently they’ve been happening more and more frequently and I’ve been getting more and more angry each time. Each argument has been about the same major topics: my behavior towards my siblings or how I “disrespect” my parents. But sometimes I can’t help what I say to my parents. If they’re in my face yelling about what I just said or how I forgot to do something, how can I not yell back? My parents say its disrespect, but I feel that they have no respect for me when they’re yelling in my face. But the topic we argue most about is my little brother. He’s 7 and if I do the slightest thing to him he goes and tells and I get the whole “you’re older and need to grow up speech”. I’m sick of it. I feel that they can’t see that my little brother does things that really bother me, and I’m not being dramatic. Like today, my little brother does this thing where he just touches me. I HATE when he does this because it’s COMPLETELY unnecessary. So I hit him back, not that hard just a slap in the arm. Just so happens my dad was walking by at the same exact time. When he saw this he immediately got in my face, hit my arm (and I had to fight back the urge to hit my dad right back), and started giving me a speech (which during I was completely being a smart aleck because I felt this whole thing was not my fault). When my mother got home I got the same speech from her, but she just didn’t understand how I felt! Then while I was in the room right next to the kitchen they started to discuss what they should do to that “devil”. But my defense is that my little brother is just very dumb and a wimp and that my parents baby him too much. But to avoid these confrontations I feel the only way to do this is to COMPLETELY IGNORE my whole family. I’ve been doing this by sleeping all day and my schoolwork is suffering, I also barely eat because of sleeping all day. But these arguments always seem to find their way into my life. Is there any way to get my parents to understand me? How do I deal with 7-year-old brother? Can I just keep ignoring them? Please do not treat his as a teenager being dramatic, this is a serious cry for help. After some of these arguments I’ve hurt myself. I scratched my arm with tweezers and today I dug my own nails into my arm. Some of these arguments have resulted in me almost getting smacked in the face by my dad. I’ve also cried for hours before. So please I’m begging for help. [/INST]  Thank you for your letter. I hope I can offer something useful.Fifteen is a rough age because you are in-between everything, and are just starting to see weak spots in your family and the world. It is very normal for teenagers and their parents to go at it during this time, and for the siblings to throw in with the mix as well. But I understand the fact that it is common doesn’t offer much comfort.Probably the best-known book about teenage girls is Reviving Ophelia: Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls written by Mary Pipher. I’d recommend reading it—see if you agree with the author, then ask your parents to read it. Sometimes an outside source can help make the change.But my guess is that you are going to need a few sessions of family therapy. The fact that you are hurting yourself because of all this demands something is done sooner rather than later. I would ask your parents directly to have you talk to a therapist, and then explains to the therapist what is happening. More than likely the therapist will engage at least one of your parents, if not the whole family.Don’t suffer in silence with this. If your parents are not willing to take you to a therapist, talk to the school counselor or a trusted teacher. He or she will be able to help get the ball rolling.This may be a tough time for you, but there are many good things waiting for you as you move through high school. As you are seeking some peace within the family, keep developing interests outside of the home: Clubs, sports, classes, etc. Work on developing yourself, not focused any on the family feud.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I need help. I am plagued by near-constant intrusive thoughts of all three main types – violent, religious and sexual. It first started when I was about 17, of course it was smaller and easier to manage back then, so I just carried on with my life. I have never had it diagnosed, I am too ashamed and fearful of being ‘branded’. But I just don’t see what else it could be. I believe I have OCD and it’s getting worse and far more difficult to control. To make it much, much worse, every time I have an intrusive thought I get an overwhelming fear that I’ve said it aloud. I obsess over the idea that the people I live with have heard me and thus now see me as every bit the vile monster that I feel I have become. It drives me to the point of paranoia. I analyse every moment I’m near them, looking for signs of fear, hatred and disgust.If I don’t find any then I feel better for a while, but it’s only until I get another intrusive thought around them. If I see the slightest thing off about my interaction with them, I panic and assume the worst. When I’m quiet and I suddenly realise that I’m not thinking about it, I panic and think that I’ve said something aloud without realising and that they’ve heard me.Please tell me, is it possible for me to say my thoughts aloud without knowing I’ve done it? [/INST]  OCD is a very treatable condition. Many treatments for OCD involve both medication and therapy. You stated that you “simply refuse to live with the side effects” of medication but you are assuming that there will be side effects. Some medications have negative side effects but others do not. It depends on the individual. Everyone experiences medication differently. What works for one person may not work for another. Among medications that commonly have side effects, many negative effects are very minor and hardly noticeable. You shouldn’t rule out medication. It could greatly decrease your symptoms and bring you immediate relief.OCD is an anxiety disorder. Without treatment, it tends to become progressively worse. You also have correctly observed that it’s a difficult illness to treat without professional help. I would agree and recommend that you consult a mental health professional. The mental health professional will evaluate your symptoms and determine the best course of treatment. Treatment may or may not involve medication. That’s a decision you ultimately will have to make.Two non-medication based treatments for OCD are cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure and response prevention therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on both your thoughts and your behavior.Exposure and response prevention therapy is a treatment that places clients in direct contact with their fears. The purpose is to habituate the client to their fears and teach them to tolerate, rather than avoid, the anxiety that arises from their fears. It might seem like a counterintuitive form of treatment but studies show that it can be highly effective for treating certain anxiety disorders.Delaying the acquisition of professional help may mean that your OCD will progress. It’s already “consumed your life.” It’s time to consult a mental health professional. It is what’s needed. I hope you will consider my recommendation. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My name is S—-, and I’m 19 years old. For most of my life, I’ve been experiencing urges to kill people. And not with guns or anything like that either. I want to slice them open with a knife, taste their raw flesh, and watch the light leave their eyes as they die. If people on the street knew what I was thinking about doing to them, then they’d probably be horrified. Fantasizing about this sort of of thing really arouses me sexually, and while it’s not the only thing that does, it’s possibly the best. These urges don’t only occur when I’m upset or angered, but those emotions definitely amplify them. For example, if I’m just standing there with something sharp in my hand, I’ll have the impulse to just thrust it into the soft throat of the nearest person. I would just love to feel it sink in, and get covered by the blood gushing from their wound. I’d probably cannibalize their body, too, because I love the smell and taste of blood. When I was younger, I would cut my arms just to taste the blood and rub it on my face. I’ve never actually killed anyone, no matter how much I’ve wanted to, but I a did stab my neighbor’s dog to death once. It just made me feel so alive, like nothing else ever had, to feel it’s fear and watch it die. Now that I’m writing this all down, it’s making me sound like some kind of deformed, basement-dwelling freak. But I’m an attractive person, have a sizable amount of friends, loving parents, and a beautiful girlfriend. She’s the real reason I’m writing this; I’m absolutely horrified by the prospect of her finding out what I’m like. I don’t want her to be afraid of me, but she’s too sweet to not be. I haven’t “gotten help” yet because I’m still living off of my parents, and I haven’t even told them I’m a lesbian yet, much less a psychotic cannibal. I just can’t see that conversation going well. I’ve also often fantasized about stabbing a therapist in the eye with his own pen, so I don’t know if that would be such a good idea. I don’t really want to have these thoughts and feelings, but my life wouldn’t be so fulfilling without them. Why am I like this? [/INST]   Your fantasies are outside the norm. Most people do not fantasize about killing and cannibalism and would find these thoughts to be immoral and an unacceptable expression of evil.Killing a dog and watching it suffer and gaining pleasure from its suffering is also something that most people would never do. It is a socially unacceptable behavior. The FBI considers cruelty to animals a crime against society.The graduation hypothesis suggests that hurting animals is an early warning sign for future violence. If an individual is willing to hurt animals, then they might also be willing to hurt people. Animal abuse has also been linked with domestic violence, child abuse and murder. Some well known killers have histories of hurting and torturing animals.You have already killed an animal. The concern is that you will hurt more animals or “graduate” to people. Also concerning is that you like these fantasies, seem unwilling to give them up, are turned on by them, and have already more or less said you don’t want to see a therapist.Mental health professionals can’t help people who don’t want help, but if you change your mind, you can get help. Getting help could be the difference between your correcting this problem or it growing into a much larger problem in your life. Had you been arrested for torturing and killing the dog, you would have likely faced jail time. Should it happen again and you are caught, given the new harsher federal laws against animal abuse, you could face significant prison time. The FBI recently reclassified animal cruelty as a Group A federal offense, a category that includes other serious crimes such as arson, burglary, kidnapping, and homicide.Whenever you recognize that something is wrong and that your behavior is a problem, then it is incumbent upon you to seek help. Seeking professional help is the most effective and responsible choice you can make. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I was attacked by a dog when I was 5, and had ~30 stitches put into my cheek and lip. We had to wait around for a couple hours for the plastic surgeon to fly in, so I know it was serious. I know that I’ve developed depression, but I want to know how much that incident contributed, and how much it’s just my personality. I’ve been told I used to sit alone on the playground in elementary school, but I really don’t remember much before the age of 10. I’m pretty sure not interacting at the critical point of social development has had lasting affects. [/INST]  You are 24. You don’t need to convince anyone to take you for treatment. You are able to make some phone calls and make an appointment. Do an internet search for a community mental health center that has a sliding fee scale. Yes, it is possible that the dog bite was a traumatic experience that caused you difficulty. It’s unfortunate you didn’t get treatment when you were young. But that was then. This is now. You are an adult. Take care of yourself the way you wish the adults in your life had cared for you then.And, please, don’t let the experience with that one psychologist color your opinion of mental health professionals. “Passive aggressive” isn’t a diagnosis and the label certainly wasn’t helpful.I always suggest that people “shop” for a therapist by making an initial appointment with several. You are looking for someone you feel you can talk to and with whom you can be honest. The most important factor in determining whether therapy will be successful is whether there is a trusting and respectful relationship between therapist and client. You owe it to yourself to find such a person.You have skills. You can support your treatment if you are motivated to do so. It’s time to take charge of your life and get the treatment you deserve.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Barbados: when i was eleven yrs old I was encouraged by my older cousin (let’s call her Jyl) to have s** with her brother (who is also my cousin) at first i objected, but she continued to pressure me so I did as she said. Eventually Jyl spoke out about the matter but never speak out about the role she played in the situation. I didn t even defend myself when she (Jyl) confessed it all, I just put on a strong face, but I was crying on the inside. Eventually everyone found out about it, as you know words spread like bush fire. In high school I was bullied for it and other rumors that Jyl and my so call friends created about me. [/INST]  Your past did not ruin your life! You were only 11! You were a victim of child abuse, not a willing or knowledgeable participant in sex. In the U.S., 11 is well below the age of legal consent. (I don’t know the law in Barbados but age 11 is a child as far as I’m concerned, regardless of legalities.) You deserve compassion and support, not bullying.Your parents could confirm whether the principal really did put something in your record. I hope that is another nasty rumor, not fact. I’m not a lawyer so I can’t give you legal advice but if there is something in your record I do think your parents might want to consult a lawyer about your rights to privacy about something that happened to you as a child. If the lecturers are participating in the bullying, I hope your parents will insist that it stop.As for your cousin and so-called friends: You need a better class of friends. I suspect “Jyl” keeps bringing it up as if she had no part in it because she knows that she and her brother are guilty of doing something terrible to you. She rationalizes it by shifting the responsibility for it on to you. By doing that, she doesn’t have to face her own guilt — and she is continuing to abuse you.It’s asking a lot of you, but I hope you can find the strength to stand up for yourself. If someone bullies you about early sex, you might say something like, “I was only 11 and was taken advantage of by people who were old enough to know better. I trusted them and they abused me. That’s not something to bully me about.” If they don’t quit, avoid them if you can. Get adults to help you. Do consider going to another school and making a fresh start if you think that is the only way to get away from the bullies. Taking care of your emotional well-being is more important than trying to change them.You are no different from the many, many other people who have been victimized as children. People do recover from abuse and do create good lives for themselves. You absolutely have a future — as long as you refuse to accept the opinions of toxic people. You will get a job based on your education and your skills, not on rumors about something that happened to you when you were a kid.Being bullied is very, very difficult. You might appreciate having a therapist to talk to about how to handle “Jyl” and the bullies and how to hold onto your self-esteem in spite of their horrible behavior.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teenager in the U.S.: About a year ago, I moved from Tennessee back to the state I was born in.

I have yet to see a professional, but I plan on it soon. As of right now, I’m looking for some uplifting advice to get me through until then. I’ve struggled with these issues my whole life. I’m just now realizing what it is and how it has affected me. As I go on in life, I’m struggling more than I should with who I am, and what to do. I’ve hit rock bottom and I’m down to the point where I literally can only say,”I just don’t know anymore”. [/INST]  What are you waiting for? Stop thinking about seeing a professional and make an appointment — please. There is no need for you to go on suffering so terribly.Your issues are making it hard for you to manage life. You are not stupid. You are not dumb. You are showing symptoms of depression and anxiety. That is nothing to be ashamed of.As you have already discovered, you have not been able to heal on your own. You are too discouraged. That is also not something to be ashamed of. It’s unreasonable to expect yourself to pull yourself out of a depression without training or support. A therapist will help you understand yourself and will provide the guidance you need to feel better.While waiting for your appointment: Please make sure you are getting at least 8 hours of sleep every night. Eat reasonably well. Cut out caffeine if you can. Take a walk outside or dance in the privacy of your room every day. Anything you do to take care of your body will help your mental outlook.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, and thank you for reading and answering my question! After more than two years of being single, I decided I needed more affection and physical attention and asked a male friend if we could try having a casual relationship (casual because I was not sure I wanted a serious relationship, because I did not know him 100% well at that point, and because I may move out of town in some months from now). This arrangement worked very well for about a month, keeping me very satisfied physically. Around the end of this month, I realized I had started liking my friend more and more as a person. At about the same time, I started losing my appetite for sex, suspetedly because I was unsure whether my friend felt the same way about me or whether I was still just a casual thing to him. After clearing up the fact that we both feel a bit more than just physical attraction for each other (while he confessed that the unclear situation was uncomfortable for him as well, as he did not know whether to invest more or not), I thought things would take a turn for the better, but instead, I find myself unable to climax. For the past two weeks, I find more satisfaction in cuddling with my partner than in sex, and it is as if my sexual organs have lost their ability to feel electrified. I do derive some erotic pleasure from his touches, but it does not escalate to the point where it can make me have an orgasm anymore. We still have sex sometimes (about twice a week), but I do it more because 1. it connects us, and 2. because I want my partner to feel good, even if I don’t feel much. Under these conditions, my partner also rarely wants to engage in or continue sex if I tell him I don’t feel so much, because he says he is never completely satisfied himself if he cannot make me have an orgasm as well. Since this has happened to me before, I fear that this will be the end of our relationship (just like back then), and it makes me feel…defective. Any suggestions are much appreciated, because I don’t plan to just let things fall apart without counteracting it every way that I can. [/INST] A: First of all, you are not defective. It is very normal for there to be a great deal of sexual “electricity” in the early stages of a relationship, and then for it to wane a little as time goes on — especially since you were initially only looking for a physical relationship and now you are looking for more. Our head gets in the way of our body all the time.I think that’s one of the reasons affairs are often so sexually charged. You aren’t trying to analyze all the other aspects that go into a serious long-term relationship, such as compatibility, affection, shared goals, family involvements, hobbies, financial stability, future aspirations, etc, etc. Once we start looking at someone as a potential life partner, all sorts of things become important, not just whether we are sexually satisfied or not.You are in your early twenties and this relationship is still in its infancy stage. Give it a chance before you predict its end. The best way to improve sexual intimacy is to improve open communication and trust. Keep cuddling, keep talking and see where things go.All the best, </s>"

"<s>[INST] I’ve been on antidepressants since 1985. I’ve had a bunch of therapy over the years mostly in the mid to late 80’s. I believe I understand and have dealt with my childhood issues. [/INST]  You are currently in the midst of a medication transition. You have described that experience as “hellish.” Many people would concur with that assessment. They too find it to be an unpleasant process. It is “hellish” largely because of the emotional dysregulation that often characterizes that experience. It is very likely contributing to your current feelings of agitation, irritability and your overall emotional instability.You should consider returning to counseling. You tried counseling approximately 20 years ago yet the depression has remained.Therapy could be advantageous for several reasons. One reason is that it might clarify whether you are currently having a depression episode or if your symptoms are associated with the transitional medication process. Secondly, a therapist could assist you in the development of relaxation techniques that might increase your emotional stability during this transitional period. Finally, therapy could help you to address your symptoms of major depression that have been your “ball and chain” for more than a quarter of a century. There are effective therapeutic modalities that can significantly minimize your depression or eliminate it from your life. Psychotherapeutic treatments have advanced a great deal since the 1980s.I would encourage you to discuss your symptoms with your psychiatrist. He or she might prescribe a medication that can quell your agitation and irritable feelings while you are transitioning to a new set of medications. Also, I hope that you will consider counseling. A competent therapist can help to permanently remove depression from your life. I wish you the best. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi, first some information to myself. I am a very planning person and hate uncertainty and feel a high degree of responsibility for my family. I also was always afraid of death and therefore also of cancer, heart attacks also. Now I had a panic attack 3 months ago that kicked off thoughts and high fear of suicide. I was so afraid that u went straight to a psychological clinic where I was diagnosed with OCD and a panic disorder. I am lucky, not afraid of driving or knives or anything like that because I really don’t want to die so I don’t think I am a risk for myself. But that now first kicked off the huge fear of a major depression that could change my attitude one day towards the fact that I don’t want to die. Luckily I could also reassure myself that I don’t have depression because I don’t really show any symptoms like listlessness or loss of happiness in activities. I also still see my friends a lot. But I somehow still are very sensitive towards my emotions and anything around me that sound like death depression, sadness, suicide or stuff like that. That stuff scares me. For example, when somebody is making a joke about me I instantly check myself to make sure I am not sad or mad or anything. That goes along with a lot of ruminations about the topics of OCD, suicide, anxiety and psychological disorders itself. I also sometimes have the feeling of derealization when I feel anxious and insecure. And since some days the fear of becoming schizophrenic or psychotic came up heavily. I don’t have any hallucinations or hear anything that isn’t there but the occasional surreal feeling of the world around me freaks me out. I am so scared that I could harm myself in psychosis. I also never took drugs or had any psychological disease in my family. Does that sound to you like an upcoming psychosis or something like that or is it just my OCD that freaks me out? (From Germany) [/INST] You have shown a great deal of resilience and fortitude in coping with these symptoms. Whatever the label, you’ve already demonstrated a great deal of courage and endurance in dealing with these difficult and uncomfortable symptoms. I can understand why it is confusing. The sensitivity and rumination can feel overwhelming, but again, I admire your ability to somehow navigate the choppy waters of these indicators.I think it would be in your best interest to begin working with a therapist, a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist in particular, who can help follow the symptoms as they emerge and come to an accurate diagnosis. The clinical psychologist often uses various tests that can help with the diagnosis, which can then pinpoint which treatment is best. Self diagnosis is difficult, and with the information you have presented it would not be possible for me to offer an opinion. Often when the symptoms overlap as yours do, a psychological examination combined with ongoing therapy to track the markers is most helpful.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi, I’m not sure if this is a problem worthy of your time, but it causes me a lot of distress. It’s affecting my life a lot. [/INST]  You think that something is wrong, when in fact nothing may be wrong. Perhaps you have yet to meet the right person. That’s what dating is all about. You meet someone, you get to know them and if you don’t like them, you end the relationship. That is how it works. You choose one to marry but only after rejecting many. It takes time to find the right one.You seem to have expectations or assumptions about love and relationships. I wonder if you are judging yourself against arbitrary standards and inappropriately determining that you don’t make the cut. Perhaps your ideas about love and relationships are based upon popular culture and if so, they could be very skewed. What you see in movies doesn’t accurately reflect real-life relationships.Abraham Maslow writes about the nature of interpersonal relationships among the most psychologically healthy people. He finds that they have especially deep relationships with few individuals. He notes that their circle of important people is rather small. That’s because getting to know someone on the deep level is time-consuming. “Devotion is not a matter of the moment.” Deep, meaningful relationships — loving relationships — require a great deal of time. They are more demanding when compared to other types of relationships.You don’t want to waste your time on someone, you have determined through dating, who is not a match. Based on what you have written, you seem to be doing all of the right things. If you continue to be concerned about your ability to connect with people, consult a therapist. An evaluation by an in-person therapist may bring you peace of mind in a way that my internet answer, with all of its generalities, cannot. Good luck. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a young man in the U.K.: A few years ago I noticed a strange tic-like symptom had appeared, it seems whenever my mind wanders to something embarrassing or uncomfortable in the past, no matter how significant or otherwise – I often tense up for a second and am unable to control myself from blurting out the words “Kill yourself” or “you should die”, “shoot yourself”; often rather loud and violently directed at my own self. I have a harder and harder time trying to squash these outbursts in public. [/INST]  It’s note-worthy that you direct all your “tics” at yourself. It suggests that your frustration with yourself is huge. In a way, you’ve taken over the bullying that others used to do to you.I don’t understand why you think a diagnosis would tarnish your “record”. Your medical record is confidential. I suspect that a diagnosis or at least an understanding of what is happening would give you enormous relief.I can’t offer a diagnosis on the basis of a letter. But I can suggest that intense bullying and the trauma of the death of a younger brother may have triggered feelings and thoughts that you have yet to deal with effectively. Your “tics” may be a way that you are telling yourself that you really do need some treatment in order to have a productive and happy life.I do hope you will take care of yourself and get the help you deserve.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, i have a brother who often gets depressed to the extremes when he sees other people from school he knows who have girlfriends and are in groups because he has no friends and has some social concerns. He is a junior in high school and im his younger brother. I feel like it is my job always to watch him and make sure he is okay. He is not one who you can sit down and have a talk without swearing and arguments. He is very difficult. [/INST]  Your brother is a lucky man to have such a concerned younger brother. I can tell it pains you deeply to see him so lonely and upset but it’s also getting to you. You were right to ask for some help.My best suggestion is that you talk to your parents. If you haven’t already done so, let them know how much your brother’s state is hurting you. You wrote a very thoughtful and articulate letter. If you can’t bring yourself to tell your folks, ask them to read your letter and this response. I think it would be helpful for you all to ask for a family consultation with your brother’s psychologist. His depression is affecting your whole family. You could all probably use some support as well as some guidance about how best to be helpful. As part of that meeting, you could discuss what treatment options (like medication) could be explored that might move things along. The psychologist will need your brother’s permission and, hopefully, his participation to make this happen. If your brother won’t consent to a family meeting, consider asking for a referral to a family therapist who can help the family learn ways to avoid getting caught up in his illness as well as ways to help him.Another resource for you and your family is NAMI: The National Alliance on Mental Illness. There is a chapter in your city. NAMI offers support groups and resources (both in person and online) to families and friends of the mentally ill. It’s often a relief for people to talk with other families who are going through the same kinds of things. People share resources, give each other affirmation and suggestions, and are there for each other through the tough times and the successes.I’m very glad you wrote to us. There is help available. You and your parents don’t have to figure this out all on your own.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am married for almost 3 years now. Ours was love marriage, waited 2 years for my husband’s parents approval before getting married. My husband do love me but only when he thinks his parents are happy. He is too concerned about their happiness that he is ignoring mine. [/INST]  Your husband is more interested in being a good son than in being a good husband. Marriage usually means leaving our childhood family and starting a family of our own. That means shifting our loyalty and priorities to our marriage. Yes, it’s important to honor our parents and to help out when we can. But marriage is about making a new beginning. That means investing time and money and energy and love in the couple. In healthy families, the parents give their blessing and support for this change.I fully understand wanting to help parents who are financially in need if a couple can. I don’t understand a husband who buys expensive jewelry for his parents but doesn’t take responsibility for at least half the bills at home. I sympathize with your disappointment and pain that your husband was more interested in buying jewelry for his mother than in paying the hospital bill. You were probably grieving the loss of a child. You needed the love and support of your husband.From all you said, I don’t think your husband wants to change. He himself told you that you need to accept the current situation or leave. My suggestion is that you leave. You are already taking care of both of you so you do have the money to take care of yourself. I don’t see anything to keep you in this relationship except the fact that you care more about him than he cares about you.You deserve better. As difficult as it may be, send this guy back to his mother. Make yourself available for someone who loves you and cherishes you and sees you as important in his life.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I think my husband is suffering from a mental disorder or schizophrenia. We have been married for 3 years and have 3children 2 being 8 month old twins. We got into a fight and the first time in 5 years i walked out and lefted. ever since then he has turned into a completely different person. It’s like he hates me he did tell me about 2 years ago that he heard voices and that he see’s ghosts all the time etc. He has been drawing weird shapes and one time he started freaking out that he had to have a note book because he had to draw something that is in his head. He ended up drawing a diamond with 69 diamonds in it. Now all of a sudden he doesn’t want to be married he walks around like he is just not really there anymore. I don’t know what to do because i just want him to know that i am here for him. It took me a while to realize what was going on. Now i want to help him and over night he has gone to hate me so much. [/INST]  It is unusual to hear voices and to see ghosts. You also described your husband as “walk [ing] around like he is just not really there anymore.” That behavior might be indicative of depression or possibly the early phase of a psychotic disorder. Based on limited details it is difficult to determine what may be wrong.If he is experiencing psychosis (which is associated with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders), then it is imperative that he seek treatment immediately. Psychosis requires intervention and if left untreated, it typically becomes worse. If safety issues are a concern, then contact your local mental health crisis team. The team can visit the home and conduct an onsite evaluation.Be vocal about your concerns. Encourage him to have a psychiatric evaluation. If you are willing and if you think it would be beneficial, offer to attend the evaluation with him. It would send him the message that you care about his well-being and might increase the likelihood that he would be open to treatment. If he is unresponsive to your attempts to help him, then you may want to involve friends or family members who you believe might help.If you have additional questions, please don’t hesitate to write again. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi, I recently had a dental checkup and was sent to an endontist for further evaluation. He upset me by telling me it does not look good and there is a lot of bone loss and asking me if I had any history of breast cancer. I do not. He is sending me to an oral surgeon to have the tooth removed and said they may need to do a biopsy. My husband is a cancer survivor and many friends suffer from it. I am terrified. I try not to worry about it but it is in my mind constantly. It does not help that I have to look up everything online..LOL Oh, I have had a terrible fear of dying ever since I can recall…Thank you [/INST]  You’re terrified because cancer is terrifying. There’s nothing inappropriate or abnormal about your fear. Sadly, you’ve also lived in fear of death for a long, long time. That’s probably embedded in some experience that you never found a way to make sense of or put aside. I’m very sorry you’ve lived with that shadow. Now the shadow becomes more real.The worst thing you can do is to put off getting whatever testing your dental specialists think necessary. Hopefully, there is another explanation for the bone loss. If you had braces on your teeth when you were young, for example, it’s possible the teeth were moved too far or too fast. Orthodontia has changed markedly since the 60s and 70s, resulting in less trauma to the mouth and better outcomes. But if your fear is confirmed and you do have a cancer, early detection is key to recovery. Don’t let your fear get in the way of getting a good assessment. Only then will you know what you’re dealing with and, if necessary, what treatment options are available to you.Once you’ve coped with the dental issues, please consider talking to a counselor about your anxiety around death. We all die. As I’m close to you in age, I fully understand the sense that time is getting shorter. Death isn’t such an abstraction when friends start to sicken and pass on. On the other hand, you could live another 30 years or so. Coming to terms with the inevitable will let you live the time you have, whether a week or decades, with more joy and less anxiety.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been going to weekly therapy for a year and half, as well as group therapy for the past year (with the same therapist). I am very comfortable with him and feel that we have a good rapport. It was difficult in the beginning because I have a lot of difficulty recognizing and expressing my emotions, but now I think that I have come to trust him. My issues included anxiety, depression, childhood trauma (bullying, divorce, isolation), and a medical condition I have with psychosomatic causes (scarring alopecia). The therapy is not very goal oriented and I don’t have any clear idea on when it might be completed. Though I have gained insight into the way I function and the causes of my distress through much introspection, I can’t say that my issues have gotten much better. I want to believe in him and our relationship…that it can truly help me to form better relationships and minimize some of my depression and anxiety. However, I know I also have to think rationally and evaluate the changes that have been made in the past 18 months. [/INST]   Your therapist sounds like he has been helpful and supportive. The easiest thing to do is for you to put your need for a more goal directive therapy out to him. Therapists have different styles, training, and process — but I can’t imagine a therapist not wanting to honor your need to set goals and make progress toward them.The establishment of the relationship is often key to many transformations in therapy. Now that the relationship has been established, it is time for you to help set the agenda.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I haven’t been doing too well the past few years. I’m 20, I have GAD, social phobia, depression, ADHD, and OCD, and I feel like I’m just getting worse. [/INST]  Although I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of a letter, what you report is consistent with depression. You feel hopeless and helpless to change anything. You are isolating and you are terribly unhappy.Without talking to your therapist, I can’t make a judgment about how she is treating you. I can only ask if she is specifically addressing your symptoms and your resistance to change. Like many people who are depressed, you may want to change but feel hopeless about the possibility for success. You may need some medication for awhile to take the edge off so you can benefit from whatever is happening in a therapy hour. That’s not necessarily a recommendation. Since I haven’t talked with your therapist, it’s just a thought.Meanwhile, you need to get on your treatment team. Instead of working hard, you are justifying your distance from others by claiming that the world is boring to you. Therapy only works if the client is willing to work on making a change. If you trust your therapist, you need to do your part by sharing your innermost thoughts and by trying out what she suggests. If you don’t trust your therapist, you need to step up and talk about it. If you can’t get to a position of trust, you may need to look for another therapist who is a better fit for you.Therapy does work. But it only works when a client partners with the therapist. I hope you will find it in you to join with your therapist in the goal of defeating your symptoms instead of sinking into depression and defeating your therapy.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Lithuania. Hello, I am a 21 year old student. I’ve been suffering from anxiety disorder, social phobia and have been taking antidepressants (escitalopram) for several years now (I had a small break,about a half year, but at the beginning of the first study year in other city my anxiety level very increased). I started to take drugs because of insomnia and high anxiety level. Time to time, I visit a psychiatrist. I had been taking cognitive behavioral therapy for over a year, but now I see that it haven’t really helped me. I still feel very anxious in various social situations, feel a lot of anxiety symptoms (body shakes, sweating, racing heart, breathlessness, etc). To make matters worse, I have found a boyfriend via internet. We have a relationships for about 5 months. He is 27 years old. He is a very good person and he really likes me. But it really hard for me to keep relationships, because I’m afraid of him. I’m afraid I will disappoint him in some way. When we meet (we do that quite rarely), I hardly can concentrate what he says, I feel very very anxious, nervous, I start sweating when he takes my hand or touch my body (we haven’t sex, and I’m virgin). I feel that something wrong with my hormones, because I just feel too much. Every date with him brings me more and more anxiety. He knows my situation, about my anxiety and stress, that I’m using drugs. He gave me some time to think what I would like to do next – to meet him again or just to stay friends, but nothing more. I feel I want to communicate with him, but it so hard and stressful, it’s hard to handle this. Maybe, it would be better decision to end relationships. But I know that this way won’t help me deal with social phobia, fear of boys and other issues. I am totally lost. Please help me to understand my complicated situation and messy thoughts. p.s. If you need to know, I had never been sexually abused. So it hard for me to understand why I have such a big fear of men. And I’m sorry for spelling mistakes, I’m from abroad. [/INST]  I admire your courage in continuing to cope with this anxiety. I would do two things to begin with, and two more to increase your chances of finding better ways to manage. The first thing I would do is talk to your boyfriend about your anxieties. I think the intimacy and support that may be helpful can be available in a relationship. I wouldn’t give it up.Secondly, I would have a frank talk with your psychiatrist and your CBT therapist that the symptoms have not improved enough. The first course of action is often to use what has been tried — but in a different way.That having been said, I would encourage you to find and join a therapy group that is focused on social anxiety. Being in a group that has other people with similar symptoms can give you the support, skills, and encouragement needed to make the right changes.Lastly, if the cognitive therapy doesn’t work better within the next three months, I would encourage you to seek another therapist, perhaps one with psychodynamic training.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, i have a question about my relationship with my girlfriend, for a year now. and i need a opinion to get to know why i am so insecure about myself. Me and my girlfriend has known each other for 2 years, the first year just as friends. I live in Denmark, and she lives in England. There is a guy from switzerland that she has known for about 5 years, she never meet him in person until this saturday. She told me about this guy a long time ago, he is of a rich family, and have what it seems to be a good life, whcih i doubt he don’t have, but he have dark side also. First of all when him and my girlfriend met online he was not telling the truth about him and his life. after some time he told the truth about how his life is. He came home in the evening from a bar with his friends where they had been in close contact with some girls. He had told her that he was there but was just thinking of her, and that as he already have a girlfriend for many years, he told her that he wanted to leave his girlfriend, and then go marry her (my future girlfriend at that time) She of course rejected him and also have told me she never could be with a guy like this, and i also believe her, it’s not about that. But this weekend he went to London, because his sister graduated from some law degree, and it happened that my girlfriend was also going to London to be with one of her childhood friends. i will say that, he told her some time ago that he wanted to have a coffee with her and things like that. we talked about it alot of times, first he asked some times where she said it couldnt be possible so. but it happened that in the train on the way to London, he calls her and they set up a coffee-meeting together. i wasnt aware of that by that time until later that evening she told me. and i was so furious, i felt so helpless and insecure, even though i trust my girlfriend, and i know she wouldnt do anything, she said if he tried anything or said anything, she would just walk away from him, which i belive, but i still cant control my rage about it, even the day after it botheres me and we had a discussion about it, and i even acted silly in some way because i was mad that they even get to meet. i don’t know why i am like this, if i see him as a threat, or what it is, but there is something with this guy i don’t like, never meet him or anything, but just all the things i hear, how he is he lies all the time, he is cheating his girlfriend and such things, makes me sick, and also the fact that he said he would marry my girlfriend in the past and even leave his girlfriend to do it. Please help, i hope anyone can help me analys my problem, if it is possible, please ask me to explain further (age 25, from Denmark) [/INST]  Thank you for writing in with your question. The fact that your girlfriend has told you all along about her communication with this other man suggests that she is trustworthy. If she had something to hide, she would be hiding it. She has been talking with him longer than she has known you, so I can understand her curiosity in wanting to meet him. They met for coffee… and she told you about it. Be thankful that you have such an honest girlfriend and let it go. If you continue to obsess about this you will most likely push her away. Your opinion of this man is not really important. What is important is your relationship with your chosen partner.Long distant relationships can be difficult to maintain, and if you don’t have trust, nearly impossible. Speak openly about your feelings, but keep your anger under control and let your girlfriend know how much you appreciate her honesty.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] In the last 2 years I’ve developed depression. Recently I’ve been having nightmares/daydreams that remind me of a past experience of abuse I witnessed and I’ll wake up crying, sweaty, and terrified. Also, lately if feels like I have a literal heart ache and I’ll always cry for no reason, I know it’s not heart problems because I’ve been to the doctor about it and my mom just thinks it’s a “phase”. I’ve also been super irritable and I feel angry all the time even when I should be happy and enjoying myself. I’ve been having thoughts that maybe I should just die, not kill myself but if a car were to be in front of me I wouldn’t move out of the way, I would just let it hit me. I tried to get my mom to get me a therapist and she keeps saying she’s going to but she hasn’t yet. I remind her at least 3 times a week. I’m just wondering how I can get her to actually get me a therapist. [/INST]  Depression is a concern, as is your anxiety. Waking up with a “heartache,” experiencing sweating and being terrified, associated with earlier memories of witnessing abuse, may indicate that you are having panic attacks. A panic attack is an intense period of fear and overwhelming anxiety. Panic and anxiety symptoms are quite unpleasant.The panic might also be indicative of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is another type of anxiety disorder. It can develop after an individual experiences or witnesses a traumatic event.You mentioned that you went to a doctor and he or she ruled out heart problems. If not heart problems, did the doctors think you might have anxiety problems? It is the next logical possibility, after health problems have been ruled out.Your biggest challenge seems to be convincing your mother that you need to consult a mental health professional. You can return to the doctor and ask him or her about the possibility of your having depression and anxiety. The doctor should recognize your symptoms as being potentially those of depression and anxiety. If your mother doesn’t believe you, then she might believe your doctor.Another idea is to show her the letter that you wrote to us at Psych Central and my response. It confirms that you may indeed have depression and/or anxiety and that it should be considered a serious matter. Mental health disorders are not “phases.” They require professional treatment, especially in cases where someone expresses passive suicidal ideation. Anyone who experiences suicidal ideation needs to be immediately evaluated by a mental health professional.My third suggestion, for convincing your mother that you need professional psychological help, is to discuss these matters with the school guidance counselor. Hearing about the seriousness of your mental health concerns from the school guidance counselor might get your mother’s attention.You are quite insightful for recognizing the need for professional help. So often, people experience psychological distress but never consider seeking professional help. Part of their hesitancy involves their erroneous belief that they “should” be able to handle these problems on their own. You’re very wise not to see it that way.You are doing the right thing by asking for help. I would encourage you to continue to ask your mother for help. Don’t stop asking until she complies. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in Belgium: Hi Doctor, In the past I saw many many scenes from many movies that I mustn’t to see it like the death of someone or shocking scenes…etc that we also called (spoilers) . Before I have no problem about it, but now I regret seeing all these scenes because it ruins the movie enjoyment and feeling. I have a bad depression when I think of it I can’t sleeping well, I feel bad, I feel sad and many other problems. [/INST]  Thank you for writing. Your experience with the movies tells me you have a strong visual memory. This is both a gift and a problem. Once you see something that you experience as emotionally powerful, it’s difficult for you to let it go. (Often people who are very successful photographers, artists, writers or film-makers share this tendency.)No. Don’t even think about ECT. It is not an appropriate intervention for this problem and, as you fear, it is not selective. You would lose memories you want to keep.I hope you have already stopped adding disturbing scenes to your memory bank. If not, stop it. You already know that it makes a problem for you.As for “erasing” the bad memories, I have a couple of suggestions:First, think about some very positive and powerful memories. If you don’t have some, go make them. Identify at least 3 such positive memories to use as a support when you are pulled to the negative ones. Whenever the negative memories start, get very quiet, take a deep breath and shift your thinking to focus on the positive ones. Engage every sense. Remember what you saw, smelled, heard, and felt both physically and emotionally. Immerse yourself in those positive memories and let yourself re-enjoy them.Then, start a practice of mindfulness. There are many sites on the internet to teach you how. Mindfulness helps you stay in the present and let go of disturbing thoughts. With practice, you’ll be able to relax and let go of the memories that trouble you.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m not sure what to do. I’m severely suicidal and have attempted to kill myself 7 months ago and can’t stop thinking about doing it again. I did see a therapist before but didn’t find she helped me at all. She told me my problems weren’t that bad and when I told her I wanted to kill myself and that no one would care she said, why don’t you try it and find out. She also said she didn’t want to see me anymore until I had a job, so that’s why I stopped going to her. I’ve been unemployed for over 3 years now and the job I did have was the first job I ever had, and they fired because of my depression. I’ve been trying the last few months to get another job and I did have an interview and almost had the job, but they hired someone else. I am finding it very hard to deal with being suicidal, unemployed, depressed and I also have social anxiety. Another thing is when I was between the ages of about 3 or 4 until I was 12, a relative who was 2 years older than me used to do sexual things to me and I’ve always had a hard time dealing with that. I’ve never really talked about it before, it did come up once in therapy but my therapist said that it was normal for kids to do that. I won’t go into details of what he did, but I know it was not normal behaviour. I want to start therapy again with a different therapist, but it scares me because I feel and always felt like my problems aren’t bad enough to warrant going to therapy. I just don’t know what to do besides trying to kill myself again. [/INST]  It is completely unacceptable and unethical to tell a client who is considering suicide to “try it and find out.” I do not know of an instance of that ever happening with any therapist that I personally know or know of.It is wise to consider seeing a new therapist. The fact that you have suicidal thoughts is concerning and a sign that help is needed. Suicide is never the answer. There are many competent therapists who could help you.Depression, in the past, was more difficult to treat. Today it is treated with great success. You are going through a difficult period in your life. It is quite common for each of us to have these difficult, troublesome periods. While we are having these painful times in our lives, it is common to assume that they will never end. Please remember that they do end. I have written here before about survivors of suicide attempts. The overwhelming, vast majority are very happy that their attempt failed. They realized the value of life and found the happiness that had been denied them.I often advise those searching for psychological help to call at least four or five therapists. You want to essentially interview therapists over the phone to find out how they would help you. Discuss your problems and ask specific questions about how they would help. Make an appointment with those with whom you feel the most comfortable. It might take some time to find a good therapist but it is worth your effort. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Back in 6th grade, my best friend and I (both guys) would mess around and play truth or dare. We would always end up doing sexual things to each other. We didn’t tell anyone except one more guy who we played the game with once. In 8th grade I stopped playing, because I wanted to force myself to be attracted to girls. I am now in 12th grade, and I still do not get sexually aroused by girls. However, more bothering than that, I do get aroused by younger boys. I don’t know if it is because of my middle school experiences or what, but I don’t know how to change. I started hanging around a freshman boy at the start of the year, and we have done a few sexual things. I don’t think he is gay, but then again nobody would think I kinda am either. I have lots of friends, play sports and have had girlfriends like any other high school guy. I hang out with the “popular” people in my grade, and my future looks pretty good if it wasn’t for this gay/pedo problem. I look at other people classified as pedophiles, and I do not fit the category at all, except I have the same feelings towards boys. I will never kidnap or rape a kid, that’s for sure. But I want this weird arousal to go away, and I need to be attracted to girls. Any help would be very appreciated! This has been a very big problem for me and if you could please just give even a little advice it would mean a lot! (age 17, from US) [/INST]  First of all, being gay and being a pedophile are two very different things. Participation in some same sex exploration while growing up is fairly common but, considering that you are still attracted to the males a few years later and indicated that you do not get aroused by females, there is a strong indication that you are most likely gay and that is not something that can be changed.However, being attracted to “boys” is more concerning. There are many factors that play into the issue, such as how big the age difference is or whether there is coercion involved. Since you are almost an adult, you also need to be concerned that you could get into legal trouble if you were to have sexual interactions with someone who is still a minor.I would suggest that you find a therapist who has specialty training with sexual dysfunctions. You may have to do some extensive research online and make several phone calls to find someone in your area who is qualified to help you, but there are many good therapists who can. All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been in a relationship with a man in his mid-40’s for over a year, and as a couple without outside influences we have a supportive, loving and kind relationship, and rarely a disagreement. We moved around the corner from his mum but the last 6 months it appears she has tried to manipulatively break us up. I’ll give you some examples. She came into our home and placed photos of him as a child on our fridge and around the house. We only ever socialise with her, friends her age, and while we are at those occasions she superficially talks up her son’s talents, and looks, and how special he is. My partner lovingly tries to talk about things me or my family are also doing, and every single time she changes the subject, or worse, talks about someone she distantly knows that did the same thing or better. My partner tries to enable me to be proud of myself and my family too, but it’s always to no avail. She has completely shattered my confidence, that I don’t speak much anymore. We’ve been trying for a baby for over a year and she told me when she found out that he can’t afford to have a child because he needs her permission because he owes her money (he doesn’t owe her much). She then tried to convince me to break up with him and go out with my best friend. They have told me for some time the family does not celebrate birthdays, but recently for my partner’s 45th all her friends starting saying his mum was organising a dinner. He said my mother won’t decide for me who I spend my birthday with. I want to spend my day with you.. Next thing, a motorcyclist had bumped the side of her car, no one was injured but he said his mum was in a catatonic state. He then told her she could organise her dinner because she wanted to. We got there, and she had pulled out of her catatonic state pretty brilliantly, with balloons you’d see at 12 year olds party and her two closest friends. I couldn’t get a word in much at this dinner, but one of her friends said she was looking for a husband, and his mum said, darling you should marry her. It’s all caused me so much pain. (From Australia) [/INST]  This has nothing to do with Asperger’s. You partner has to step up and confront his mother about her shenanigans. This is simply an immature manipulative effort on his mother’s part. It isn’t worth your time or effort to continuing a relationship with someone that doesn’t accept you. He needs to explain to her exactly what she is doing and how destructive it is. Once this is done –confront her every time she does something that undermines you, and both of you praise her and validate her when she does something supportive. If she doesn’t respond in a reasonable amount of time I’d begin severely limiting time and contact with her.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hey, firstly, I have already been diagnosed with having mild Social Anxiety (by a psychiatrist) and am definitely an introverted person anyway. I came across schizotypal personality disorder having seen it mentioned and being curious as to what it was and upon googling, discovered a few aspects that sounded very similar to my own personality! [/INST]  You’re very welcome. While I can’t know with certainty if you have a disorder, I don’t believe that you meet the criteria for schizotypal personality disorder. Most of the symptoms that you mentioned are either normal or more characteristic of an anxiety disorder. Further supporting my contention is the fact that you were evaluated by a psychiatrist and he or she diagnosed you as having an anxiety disorder rather than schizotypal personality disorder.With regard to being interested in the afterlife, this is not an unusual interest. The majority of individuals, at some point in their lives, will contemplate what happens after we die. It is a normal and healthy interest. All religions, philosophers, and great thinkers have considered what happens after death.The type of “magical thinking” that you experience is not the same type of “magical thinking” that is being described by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM), the guidebook that mental health professionals use to diagnose mental health disorders. You described wondering if magic exists in the world. It’s normal to wonder if a particular phenomenon is real. The type of “magical thinking” that the DSM is describing is more in line with whether an individual believes that he or she is being controlled by or influenced by a paranormal phenomenon. You explicitly stated that you do not believe that you have magical powers. In my opinion, your interest in whether magic exists in the world is inconsistent with the type of magical thinking that is characteristic of schizotypal personality disorder.The social anxiety that you described seems more characteristic of a social anxiety disorder rather than schizotypal personality disorder.It seems as though the diagnosis your psychiatrist has provided is likely accurate. Also consider the fact that he or she presumably conducted a full-scale psychiatric and social history and after having done so concluded that you have a social anxiety disorder rather than schizotypal personality disorder.It is wise to conduct research on other possible related mental health disorders. It is also wise not to jump to conclusions. My recommendation would be to learn as much as you can about social anxiety disorder and use that education to help with the disorder. Fortunately, you are in treatment. With treatment, you can expect the elimination of social anxiety from your life. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Our 25 year old daughter is suffering and we feel helpless. She has struggled for many years with alcohol abuse, drugs and relationships. Her reaction to stress has increased significantly over the last months; melt-downs, destroying property, threatening with knives, excessive drinking, DUI, and severe depression. She refuses to go to the hospital for treatment although she has seen a specialist before. She is more and more becoming a danger to her own safety and those around her. When stressed or emotional she finds people who are enablers but leave her stranded in the most dangerous of places within inner. She has current issues with violations of public drunkenness, DUI, and now assault. What are our options as parents to get her the medical treatment she needs and to protect her and others even though she refuses to recognize or accept the dangers. [/INST]  Unfortunately, you have few options in this situation because she is an adult. Even if she were diagnosed with a mental illness, the way the laws are written in most states, she has the right to do what she wants, even if it’s destructive. If she’s a danger to herself or to others, she can be involuntarily hospitalized, for a short time, but as soon as she is no longer a danger to herself or to others, she will be released. Upon discharge, the hospital staff will recommend that she participate in treatment and provide her with referrals to local mental health professionals but they cannot force her to participate in treatment.The other possibility is that she could end up incarcerated. Even when mental illness is present, many people are taken to a jail instead of to a treatment center. There are several reasons why this happens, but primarily it’s because there are fewer mental hospitals in communities than there used to be. It’s sometimes more feasible for police officers to take people to a jail than to a hospital. It is a sad state of affairs.My recommendation is that you contact the local National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) support group in your community or other support groups for parents dealing with similar issues. These groups can provide both emotional support and knowledge about the mental health system that might assist you with your daughter. You might also try visiting the Parents for Care and Treatment Advocacy Center websites. They provide important information concerning individuals with mental illness and treatment options for families caring for a loved one with a mental illness.It is very difficult to watch someone you love engage in self-destructive behaviors and then realize there is nothing you can do to help. It is an immensely frustrating and helpless feeling. Generally speaking, there is little that you can do to help someone who does not want help. The mental health system has very few options for parents in these situations. Connecting with support groups might be one way to learn more about the local mental health system and potential ways it could be utilized to help your daughter. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in Saudi Arabia: while growing up my family was very close to another family consisting of a couple and their son who was 2 years younger than me. i loved them and considered them to be my 2nd family. But when i turned 9 and i started developing breasts, ‘the husband’ began touching me and i thought it was inapproppriate back then. but now that i think about it he never touched me anywhere private. i remember him rubbing and pinching my upper arm which in no way is sexual but it was the expression on his face the made me feel disgusted. another time he put his arm inside my shirt and rubbed my back when no one else was around. [/INST]  Unwanted touch is unwanted touch. This man violated your sense of personal space. As a young child, you couldn’t understand sexuality but you could sense that something was wrong. It’s positive that your parents did listen to you and that the family gradually stopped visiting.As for the masturbating: Often young children do what is called a repetition compulsion. They repeatedly play about or imagine something bad that happened to them as a way to try to make sense of it. Unfortunately, the intrusion by this man got connected for you with sexual feelings.And also unfortunately, the more you masturbate to fantasies of this man, the more you will probably do it. Orgasm is a powerful feeling of pleasure and release. In your case, it is reinforcing the masturbatory behavior. You need to find another fantasy that arouses you and substitute it for the ones you’ve been using.This is important. If you don’t separate sex from an abusive fantasy, it will be difficult to have an intimate, loving, physical relationship with someone you love.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I was diagnosed with OCD when I was very young maybe 12 or 13. I have had an on again off again relationship with Meds I mostly have intrusive thoughts and anxiety. I am currently back on meds but recently I have been going through a very hard time after moving to a new state and experiencing a few traumatic life events. I was abused regularly by my father and he eventually committed suicide. I am definitely a hypochondriac. I have had severe problems with impulse control particularly with Substance abuse and Money. I tend to ruminate a lot. I have always had a desire to fit in even If I had to lie to do it. I learned to lie to avoid abuse when young. I’ve had one serious relationship in my life that ended after my father died for a number of reasons. When I get depressed or OCD like thoughts I don’t like being alone. My family has been as supportive as they can be, but recently after Google, self-diagnosing I think I might have BPD. But of course with OCD I always think I have some illness I thought I was schizophrenic for a time. But I do do the following: Worry a lot, become concerned that people don’t like me or are talking about me even though I know its irrational and makes no sense all of this worsened after my recent move. But anyway, after googling BPD I definitely am impulsive, am a substance abuser and when I love I love very intensely. When my last girlfriend broke up with me I fought hard to keep her, I tried everything. Recently after starting on Meds again (like a week ago) and quitting my drug of choice Marijuana I have been prone to some mood swings and irritability. I took the quiz online for BPD and it said it was likely. What is your professional opinion? I tend to idealize people especially people that remind me of my father. I don’t devalue them without reason but I do if they have consistently shown themselves to be taking advantage of me. I have some paranoia and fear and GAD but based upon what I’ve described with a high propensity for impulsivity of special note with substance and Money, does your team think I have BPD or is it just my OCD? [/INST]  I appreciate how difficult it can be to cope with these symptoms — and it sounds like you’ve been dealing with them for a while. While I read that you have various medicines, I haven’t heard you talk about any psychotherapy. I would highly recommend this because a diagnosis is only important if it helps treatment. You have a very clear understanding of what your symptoms are. I think it would be good to talk to a therapist about methods and interventions you can use not only to deal with the symptoms — but to also amplify your strengths.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m concerned about my mother in law’s “Alcohol Psychosis?” This issue is mainly of concern for my mother in law. I don’t necessarily know how to describe her alcohol issue; since it’s unlike others. My husband gets VERY upset & embarrassed if his parents drinking problem is brought up. He hides it any way he can. He has a very small family. (Mom, Dad, Sister, & nephew.) We’re the only ones who know about her problem. His parents don’t drink daily. They go weeks with out it. His dad is somewhat normal when he drinks. BUT.. Something SNAPS when his mom gets ahold of alcohol. She turns into a whole different person. She screams, yells, sobs uncontrollably, says nasty & hurtful things, hits, talks nonsense that makes NO sense, is delirious, breaks things, calls our phones several times, leaves hate msgs, walks down the street knocking on people’s doors, & calls 911 REPEATEDLY asking to send an officer out for “imaginary” emergencies AND to “feed her fish and take care of her dog!” She’s had police called on her 100’s of times, arrested many times, taken to a psych facility, & has been rushed to the hospital for false emergencies! Then, doesn’t remember the next day. My mother in law has never had a driver’s license. So the only way she gets alcohol is if she walks somewhere, or if my father in law brings it home. He knows better than that. But still brings it home? My husband & sister in law are so fed up, that they just say, “Whatever happens happens, it’s their own fault.” They’ve thrown so much $ away due to their parents drinking, they AND the police had a crisis group come over, a psych facility, & took her to AA meetings. If she’s not drunk & causing mayhem, we have a good relationship with his parents! We even have breakfast together on Sundays! She doesn’t associate with her family, has NO friends, & doesn’t leave home unless she’s walking the dog. It’s just when she drinks, she turns psycho! She admits to having a problem, but won’t let anyone help! (She also refuses any medications of any kind; so if maybe it’s psychological too, she’ll refuse ANY medical treatment.) It’s been going on for so long, my husband gave up. He says, “If she’s put in jail, maybe she’ll learn her lesson.” We already have to help their bills because they’re so broke. I’m always the one that does a “drive by” at night if I know she’s drinking. I just want to help. My husband shuts down & gets mad if it’s brought up between us. Like, if I ask about it or try to offer help/ideas. He gets furious, & says, “I don’t care if they screw up, & it’s got nothing to do with you, so drop it!” So after this problem description, I want to know what I can do? I have a couple alcoholics in my family as well. So I know what the common behaviors are. In this case with my mother in law, I’ve never seen or heard of alcohol having this kind of effect! I know my husband like, gave up. It doesn’t have to be this way. She can hurt herself, or even worse! She handed her debit card to a stranger to go buy her liquor. (And obviously never got it back.) I’m out of ideas, & don’t know or understand her behavior very well. Do you have any suggestions? Sites to look up, an explanation of how this “insanity” works? Thank you so much! Sincerely, “Concerned Wife!” [/INST]  It sounds to me like there may be a few things going on, but of course it would be too difficult for me to try to accurately identify all the possibilities. What I can say is that there is something you can do directly to begin coping with this. You don’t need permission or need your husband to be onboard with it: Al-Anon. Al-Anon is for family and friends of people who are having problems drinking. Your mother-in-law needs help, but at this point the best thing you can do is learn how to take care of yourself and hope that your husband and others can be inspired by you going.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, Over approximately the last year and a half I feel as I have become a very unstable person. I am constantly becoming angry over very little things and sometimes I notice that I am angry for no reason at all. It is usually a very intense anger and I feel as it controls me and I mostly cannot control it. It is like every little thing sets me off into a rage and I make very poor decisions such as punching something, breaking something or throwing something. I have punched three holes into the walls of my house and have broken more things than I can count. I have also been having a constant feeling of emptiness, it is hard to describe but it literally feels like something is missing from inside me and nothing can fill it. Sometimes if I drink alcohol the feeling subsides but sometimes it can make it worse to. But nothing else I have tried make the feeling go away. [/INST]  I agree – this isn’t an age thing—this is a self-regulation thing. Each symptom you have identified is something that would be helped through a degree of self control or self regulation.You profile said that you are in college—so I would talk to the people at the counseling center to get some individual therapy to help you develop the skill to regulate these reactions. Along the way I would encourage you to take a meditation or yoga class. These will help you as well.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: Me and my girlfriend have been dating for a while and recently broke up because she has a lot of trouble controlling her emotions. When we argue she says a lot of hurtful things and then randomly apologizes for it later. Its really confusing because I don’t know what she really means sometimes. [/INST]  I’m very sorry this relationship has become so disappointing. I think you already know what I’m going to say: Your girlfriend is more committed to her relationship with weed than she is to her relationship with you. Clearly, she is one of the people who can’t handle marijuana and who needs more than good intentions to quit for more than a minute. If she were serious about quitting, she would get herself into counseling or a support group or an addiction program. Instead, she is using emotional blackmail to continue having you in her life while she continues to smoke.She may say she hates you if you leave her. But leaving her may be exactly what she needs to “get it”. Many people with addictions need to do what’s called “hitting bottom” to wake up to the cost of addiction. Sadly, there are people who need to lose the love and support of people who love them before they are willing to admit they need help. If she is like that, it is doing her no favors for you to keep going back for more heartache.I think you should lovingly tell her that you can’t be in a relationship with both her and weed. Let her know how much you care and how much you wish it were different. If it’s true, tell her you would be willing to try again after she’s been quit of weed for 6 months but no sooner.If she says she loves you but can’t do that, she is in serious denial about the hold that weed now has on her. In that case, I hope you will take a big step back from the relationship and make yourself available to other people. You deserve to be the first in someone’s life — not playing second fiddle to weed.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From New Zealand: My friend’s quite ill at the moment and I went with some friends to visit her at the clinic she’s staying at. When I was at home later in the evening my dad that I dressed up too much to visit a sick friend and that I wouldn’t have any friends if I treated people that way. He meant it like, I was showing off or something, I guess in a mean way. As in, my friend’s very sick and I’m making myself all pretty as if to make her feel worse or to make myself feel better. I felt very offended as this was of course not my intention at all and I didn’t know how he could even see it that way. I was wearing this sort of shirt dress and a zip hoodie. I like to dress nicely and try to have good style so it never even occurred to me that my clothes could be perceived inappropriate. [/INST]  I appreciate how hard you tried to be fair and to take responsibility for your part in these arguments. Yes, you need to be respectful. Yes, you need to work on learning ways to control your anger. And yes, you need to learn when the best thing to do is to back down and walk away. You know your dad has anger management issues. You know talking back will only get you hurt. So why would you do things to provoke him? You won’t win any argument with him so please quit trying.The answer to your question is that it doesn’t matter how common or uncommon it is for parents to beat their children. It isn’t right for any parent to be violent and to beat his child – no matter how much the kid provokes. My guess is that your mother is as afraid of your dad as you are. If she intervened strongly, he might turn on her. Her only way to protect you is to try to mediate. I do suggest you try to talk to her when you can be calm and rational about it and when you can sympathize with the tough spot she’s in. Perhaps if you work together, you can come up with some better ways to handle it when your dad gets upset.You do have some other choices as well: You can know in your heart that violence is wrong is wrong and keep clear of your dad by staying out of arguments. (It doesn’t matter how “right” you are if you end up getting hurt.) You (and your mom) could seek out help from a domestic violence program. Check out this website/a> for information. Or you could notify the police the next time he beats you. I do strongly suggest you try out the first two options before resorting to the third. Once the legal system gets involved, you lose control over what happens next. The police have protocols they have to follow. Do call the police if all else fails and you are getting hurt, of course. But try getting connected with a program to end family violence first.I’m very sorry you don’t feel safe with your dad. It’s certainly not the relationship I would wish for you or you would wish for yourself.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Canada: Hi, I have been dating my boyfriend for about a year now, he had a girlfriend for a pretty long time before me, and I knew when we started our relationship they were still friends. I was actually pretty sure he wasn’t over her, I had brought this up to him and he denied it, and eventually she left the city for a few months. But every time we run into her you can tell she’s not over him by the way they act. I’ve caught her texting him twice now, and when I confronted him he said they hadn’t had contact for a while before that, and he showed me the text and that he never responded back. He gives me no reason not to trust him, but for some reason I really don’t. I question everything he says to me, and I always have these terrible thoughts that he’s lying to me. I don’t know what to do because I love him, but I just keep having such bad thoughts about him. Her birthday is next week and I really have a feeling he is going to tell me he’s going out with people from work… How do I bring this mistrust up to him, or should I? How do I stop thinking these terrible things about him, when he hasn’t done anything. [/INST]  You knew from the beginning that they were still friends. Just because it didn’t work out doesn’t mean they can’t be interested in what happens in each other’s lives. The generous and trusting thing you can do about her birthday is to add your good wishes to his and support him if he wants to take her out for a glass a wine before coming home to you. If your relationship is strong, periodic contact with the ex isn’t going to matter.The most important factor in a love relationship is mutual trust. If you can’t bring that to the relationship, when your boyfriend clearly deserves it, all the emotional aspects of love won’t make up for it. If you keep believing you are in a contest for his love, you will lose. At some point, he won’t be able to tolerate always being under suspicion.No, I wouldn’t bring it up to him any more. From all you said, it’s your issue. Work on yourself. If you can’t relax, it might be helpful to see a therapist to get to the root of your anxieties and learn how to manage them. I hope you will. It sounds like the guy is worth it.I wish you well.  </s>"

[/INST]  I don’t know what is possible for you in your country. If you were in the U.S., I’d be suggesting you think hard about whether you want to stay with someone who is as controlling and abusive as your husband. He keeps you off balance and submissive with his fault-finding, accusations, his bad temper and his unreasonable demands. He is unlikely to change.No woman deserves to be beaten by the person she loves most. No child should grow up watching her mother be physically and emotionally abused by her father. She is learning that this is what she can expect from a relationship someday.Since he won’t go to counseling, please go yourself. You need the perspective, guidance and support that counseling offers. You are a smart woman — smart enough to be doing graduate work. Now be smart about your personal life too.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  From the Phillipines: Since when I was young I started talking to myself and do pretend conversation but in mute voice. I pretend to be a character that I knew or have a conversation with other T.V. personalities. Until now I am still doing it. I don’t remember well how it this talking to myself started. I just wanted to know if this is a mental disorder or this connected to my poor memory because now I can’t quite remember some of my past. How can I stop doing this? Thank you very much. [/INST]  This is not usually an indication of a mental disorder. It could be that you were a particularly imaginative and creative kid, and it was your way to create stories that you were too young to write down. If you were lonely as a child, it’s possible that you started talking to yourself as a way to have “friends” to play with. Or another possibility is that you were criticized for not doing things “right” and found that talking things through, step by step, helped prevent you from making mistakes. Or it could be something else. Without knowing you, I can’t give you a definite answer about how it started.I’m not convinced you need to stop telling yourself stories unless it is making it difficult to be around other people. If you can keep it to yourself and you enjoy it, it may not be a problem. It’s just part of the quirkiness that makes you you.If you do want to stop it because it is giving you problems socially, then what to do depends on the reason it started. If you are creative, you could start writing your stories or finding other ways to express yourself. If you are lonely, maybe you need help learning how to make friends. If you are scared you’ll make mistakes, you need reassurance that mistakes are only human.If this habit is troublesome to you, I suggest you see a counselor for a few sessions to help you understand how the habit is useful to you and how to reduce it by finding new ways to deal with whatever is at the root of the problem.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I recently split up with my boyfriend of 7 years and immediately my mum started to give he a hard time. It is only now, a few months later that I am beginning to see what some of the problem is. It is to do with the fact that mum has always treated me differently from my brother, and it seems she doesn’t love me in the right way. At first I was upset and we argued and we didn’t speak for a few months, then my boyfriend met someone else and I was devastated. Even at this point my mum couldn’t bring herself to be nice to me or to show me any love. It is always about her and how difficult things are for her. I am beginning to realize that there is something definitely wrong now, but I do not know how to get past it. It has really affected me deeply and when I’m trying to deal with negative feelings to do with splitting up with my long-term boyfriend the thing with mum has just about finished me off. I am living with family friends because I can’t be with her and my dad at home. I have tried to talk to her but been met with rejection again. I have decided to go away for 5 months to give myself a break but the reality is that I then will only have had a handful of conversations with my mum in a year by the time I get back. I feel so awful about myself because I think it is inevitable that I feel I have done something to cause it. Would it help me to see someone professionally about this? I’m not sure who it would be.

"<s>[INST] Hello. When I was little, my dad used to pin me on the bed to pull my underwear down and bite my bum until it bruised, all the while I kicked and screamed. I wasn’t able to sit down at times afterward. I also have brief flashbacks to when I was left home alone with him. He would call out my name in a high-pitched voice to sound like my mum, and he would get me to go in the bathroom. From where our toilet was positioned, I could see him fully. He would laugh when I went in and turn to me (still exposed). The flashback ends there, but I get this sick feeling about it. I don’t remember leaving the bathroom, and I remember him doing this more than once. I also remember someone opening my bedroom door, and I would pretend to be asleep. That’s as far as that memory goes. A lot of the time at night I would listen through the wall, but I don’t know why. [/INST]  It’s difficult to know if you were sexually abused and you may never truly know unless your father admits it. The fact that he inquired about your memories and offered an apology may be his way of admitting abuse. It’s also possible that he doesn’t remember what happened because he was high. He may have his own suspicions about being sexually inappropriate with you. That might be why he apologizes without saying anything more. Alternately, it may be that he is too frightened to admit the truth.Exposing himself to you might have constituted sexual abuse. At minimum, it was inappropriate and wrong. Your knowing about sex acts at such a young age, and his biting your rear end is unusual, both of which might be considered circumstantial evidence of abuse.Yes, it is possible that you were abused and, yes, you should report these experiences to your new therapist. Rarely do victims have “concrete evidence” of abuse. Even if your memories are unclear, your therapist needs to know everything about your history and what you think may have happened with your father. It is good that you are seeking treatment. It is the best place to address the aftermath of these experiences. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I am terrified of life. I am anxious all the time. I have panic attacks almost every time I leave the house. I say one thing and act the opposite way. I’m depressed more often than not. I think about suicide every day, or at least every other day. I’ve contemplated it, thought about the best ways to do it. I drink too much and then act worse. [/INST]  I don’t know how your low opinion of yourself got started but it certainly has taken on a life of its own. You are ruminating. That means that you are going over and over and over and over how inadequate you are. Like water moving over a stone, the repetition is wearing you down and out. By repeatedly telling yourself what a worthless person you are, you are reinforcing your sense of your own worthlessness.Enough. You don’t have to do that. Since you do know that things you do are “stupid and mean,” you aren’t psychotic. You do know that you are stuck in negativity and you do know the difference between right and wrong. The fact you are ignoring is that you are choosing the life you have. Because it is a choice, you can choose a different path.Since you haven’t been able to pull yourself out of this hole on your own, I hope you will make an appointment with a therapist. Therapy will help you stop the ruminating and start to put a better life in motion. Cognitive-Behavior Therapy would probably be the most helpful.Writing to us here at PsychCentral was a very good start. It shows that you haven’t really given up on yourself. Take that little indication of self-respect another step. Get yourself the help you need and, yes, deserve.I wish you well.  </s>"

I believe it was her Mom who first put this thought in her head and now they both hardly sleep — all while dealing with her dad’s condition. My friend is very intelligent and is going to grad school, and I’m nervous about how this is affecting her life. How do I talk to her about this? Is it possible that the stress of her dad’s condition has brought this on? I wonder if this paranoia will pass or increase after her dad passes. [/INST]  This is an unusual situation. I wish I had more information. It is possible and very likely that the stress of her father dying is contributing to the paranoia.You can try speaking to your friend about the importance of focusing on reality. For instance, she believes these things are real but does she have proof? In all likelihood, there is no proof. Pointing that out to her might help her to see reality more clearly.You can also suggest that they install cameras and/or a security system in their home. It might quell their fears or perhaps not. They might simply think that the security company is part of the conspiracy.You should suggest that she and her family seek help from a mental health professional. Your friend’s primary care physician can provide referrals to local agencies.Do what you can but keep in mind that your attempts at helping may be ineffective. You can make suggestions and try to offer your assistance but they may not want your help. Also, it is possible that because of your efforts to help them, they will come to believe that you too have become part of the conspiracy.I’m sorry that I don’t have a more actionable plan for you but it’s difficult for me to help when I have so little information about this unusual circumstance.

"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: This year, one of my best friends has gone through a lot of issue with his other friends. He really feels like he has no one left besides me. All he ever does is work or stay at home. He rarely comes to church anymore. He deleted all of his social media accounts and now he wants to switch to online schooling. I’m really worried that he will fully isolate himself if he does that but I could also see how it would be good for him. I only want what’s best for him and I’m not sure if I should encourage him to stay in public school or do online schooling like he wants.Is this type of isolate healthy? [/INST]  Your friend is very fortunate to have such a caring friend. The simple answer to your question is “no”. It’s not healthy for someone to isolate themselves and to confine their relationships to those on line.The issue, in his case, is not how he should get his schooling. The most important issue is how he is going to find people he can get to know up close and personal. He will only develop the social skills and network of supportive friends everyone needs to be successful in life by being around people and working at making and maintaining friendships.I don’t know what discouraged him so much that he is withdrawing from life. I do know that he needs to find some way to get back into it. A therapist would certainly be helpful. In addition, volunteering at a cause he believes in, joining a club or organization that interests him or taking classes at a community college or at a town recreation department are ways to find people who are like-minded and who share his interests. Do encourage him to explore opportunities like these.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Australia: My mother and I have always had a volatile relationship. Last night she drank a bottle of red wine and when I queried her about it she became angry and went to her room and came out with her bags saying I will not stay where I am not wanted. Since she lives 7 hours drive away and was quite drunk, I blocked the door and said don’t be silly you’re drunk, just go to bed. She yelled at me that she would “beat me down” and “just you try,” things escalated very quickly and we ended up in a physical situation. [/INST]  You and your mother are cooperating in keeping this “dance of anger” going. There is something relieving for both of you in the fights or you wouldn’t keep it up. Meanwhile, make no mistake about it, your little girl is learning that this is the way that mothers and daughters treat each other. I hope that reality will give you extra motivation to make some changes.My guess is that neither you nor your mother has a healthy self-esteem. She only feels good about herself if she feels morally superior to her ex. You only feel good about yourself when you feel guilty for the fights. Neither position is healthy or helpful.Clearly there is something that binds the two of you together. You keep trying to be in relationship. You both keep going back for more. But if you and your mom could stop the cycle of anger on your own you would have done so already. I strongly encourage the two of you to get into some family therapy together. Two intelligent women like yourselves can work through your individual and collective pain and can forge a more positive and loving mother-daughter relationship. Do it for yourselves. Do it for your little girl.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve been dating my girlfriend for around 8 months now . She’s an amazing girl , and has everything I need from a life partner.

But I can’t let go of her past . Almost all the time , I am haunted by her past sexual experiences and get such disturbing images in my mind . [/INST]  Unless you date someone who has been entirely sheltered until the minute you meet, she is going to have some kind of “past.” We all do things we maybe wish we hadn’t done when we were young. We all have had experiences that make us into who we are. Part of growing up is learning from our mistakes as well as from our successes. How do you think your girlfriend became so “amazing”?My guess is that you haven’t been totally sheltered from the world either. Why should she be any different? Your experiences may have been different but different doesn’t make your past any better or worse than hers — just different.Please ask yourself why it is so important to you to feel superior to this woman you say you love. If you can’t let it go, it’s only fair to her and to yourself to separate. However wonderful you may be, she can’t be expected to go through life feeling judged by you. However amazing she is, you can’t go through life doubting the person you love.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My brother just turned 28 recently, he’s had anxiety issues for years now but just recently in the last 2 weeks states he got threatened on social media and is now in fear for his life. Our fam. believed him up until the point to where he is paranoid over anyone looking at him a certain way, he swears people hacked his phone and are tracking him, he made mom get rid of her phone due to fear of tracking her and listening to their conversations too. Now he’s talking about selling his car, went through 3 different phones, wants to move out of state or country. Every time we talked to him to calm him down and tried to tell him he was being too paranoid he would get upset to where he would almost tremble because he said we wouldn’t take him seriously and his life was in danger. We talked him into getting evaluated & says 2 Dr’s diagnosed him with schizophrenia. now he’s at a rehab center for 2 weeks to help him but states the new doctor said he is NOT schizophrenic and would do other tests. I’m concerned that he isn’t being totally honest with new Dr. & isn’t getting the help he needs since he is still being paranoid over his phone and every car he sees parked. What can I do to help since he is an adult and wont give me much information. [/INST]  This is a challenging situation. Since he is an adult, he is able to make decisions for himself despite the fact that he is currently experiencing what seems to be psychosis.When people are psychotic, they are not thinking clearly. He is convinced that he is being followed and it is probably making him very frightened and thus he’s reacting accordingly. Currently, in most states, people who are actively psychotic are legally able to make decisions about their care, except in cases where they have been declared incompetent by a judge or pose a danger to themselves or to others.It’s very common for people with schizophrenia not to believe that they have the illness. It is thought to be the result of anosognosia, a neurological condition that prevents people from knowing that they are ill. It’s so common that it’s actually a symptom of schizophrenia. Approximately half of the people with schizophrenia don’t think they are ill. If an individual does not think they are ill, then they are unlikely to accept treatment. Without treatment, psychosis typically worsens.Treatment works but when an individual does not engage in the treatment, they don’t get better. This can be very difficult for family members who are caring for a loved one with a psychotic illness. In this way, schizophrenia is a family illness. Family members often feel helpless when a loved one, who is clearly ill, refuses to participate in treatment. It’s difficult on everyone.You should encourage him to seek treatment. You can also report your concerns to his doctors. Privacy laws prevent them from contacting you (unless he gives them permission) but you can contact them to provide them with information. It’s also best to avoiding arguing with him about his belief that he’s being followed. As you learned first-hand, it only makes the situation worse. In his mind, his being followed is very real to him. Evidence to the contrary will have no effect upon the psychotic mind. By definition, psychosis is a break with reality. It can be a very frightening experience.One of the best books written about dealing with a psychotic family member, who is refusing treatment, is I’m Not Sick I Don’t Need Help by Xavier Amador. It’s a useful resource and can provide you with good suggestions for how to handle this problem. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen guy in the Channel Islands: So, I just wondered in your professional opinion if it is either maybe me going crazy or if there may be a chance (obviously I know there’s always a chance), but if there maybe an actual high likelihood my sister may be sociopathic. I think its important to note that I’ve looked at quite a few signs, but haven’t been able to come to a conclusion for years now. [/INST]  I don’t have enough information to know if your sister is sociopathic. I do know that regardless of whatever label you put on it, you have good reason to be afraid of her. Her behavior toward you is more serious than the usual sibling rivalry. People who are as temperamental as you describe her are often using their changing moods to control those around them. Ironically, it is often because they are insecure.It probably isn’t all that helpful to try to define a diagnosis. If you want a relationship with her, you are old enough now to attempt to have an honest talk with her about the effect of her past behaviors and how to move forward. You will be more successful in such an attempt if you resist the temptation to blame and shame and instead focus on what you want from her now.If she continues to be volatile and isn’t interested in talking, there isn’t much you can do except to stay away from her as best you can. There is no need for you to put up with abusive behaviors just because she is your sister.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am 28 and married, there are several things i want to include, and due to word limit will give brief bits under headings. [/INST]  You come very close to fitting the typical description of depression. Depressed people often feel that doing things is “pointless” or prefer to be alone or to sleep. People who are not depressed can feel the meaning and purpose of their life. They feel the richness of life and want to share it with others. Lacking meaning and purpose, in one’s life, is a hallmark sign of depression. No one can diagnose you over the internet. I am only pointing out similarities and not attempting in any way to offer a diagnosis. A diagnosis must come from meeting in-person with a therapist, who will gather relevant information and is free to ask the many questions of you that are necessary.Gambling and drinking are also consistent with depression. They are distractions— forms of escapism. When you are engaged in these activities, you don’t have to think about your problems. When you’re gambling, you’re focused on the game, your next move, your next hand, your next roll of the dice, etc. When drinking, you’re numbing your emotions. For a brief time, alcohol erases your problems. Those activities bring temporary relief but they are band-aids. They ultimately drive you further away from happiness and can lead to more suffering, pain and anguish; for you and also for your family.I would recommend counseling. It could be immensely helpful in determining whether you have depression and why you are having these problems. We all have the capacity to improve our lives. You can choose to seek help and by doing so, significantly increase the probability of your happiness.Let me share one last thought with you. There is a remarkable documentary about a man named David McCallum who was exonerated after spending nearly 30 years in prison for a crime that he did not commit. The fact that he was eventually released is nothing short of a miracle because, despite his clear innocence, his exoneration seemed unlikely. The majority of the documentary took place when Mr. McCallum was still in prison, when his being released was against the odds. The most astonishing aspect of Mr. McCallum was his attitude. Even though his chances of leaving prison were minimal, he maintained an appreciative and upbeat attitude. He was not angry or bitter, which would have been understandable, given his circumstances, but he chose another way. It reminds me of the quote by Viktor Frankl, a psychiatrist who survived a concentration camp, who said that “everything can be taken from man but one thing: the last of human freedoms–the ability to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances.”The documentary also underscores something that most people take for granted, which is freedom. The freedom to make choices in our lives, the freedom to positively change the course of our lives by the choice of our actions. In your case, the action that could positively alter your life course, would be seeking help. By doing so, you would be choosing a better life for yourself and for your family. Make no mistake, getting help is a choice and the freedom to make that choice is yours.You can begin the process of seeking help by asking your primary care physician for a referral or by clicking the find help tab, at the top of this page, to locate a therapist in your community. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in Egypt: I could remember myself back 3-4 years ago. I was just trying to be ‘normal’, because I was just a kid. I didn’t know what I want or even who I’m, so I used to try to stick to what’s known as ‘good’ if you know what I mean. [/INST]  The simple answer to your question is “No”. It’s not normal to be so isolated. Human beings are social creatures by nature. As much as you want to think you live in a universe of one, you don’t. Like everyone else in the world, you are dependent on other people in a variety of ways. Even a hermit needs other people to be a hermit from.You’ve compensated for not being able to figure out how to get along by withdrawing from the social world. If you continue to live like this, it is going to have negative effects on both your mental and physical well-being.So, as much as I think you are going to hate it, I do think you need to see a mental health specialist for an evaluation. You may be right that you are just a misanthropic individual but, even if that’s the case, it may be important to understand why. With that understanding, you can decide if you want to keep it up or change it. It also occurs to me that you may be on the high end of the autism spectrum. If that’s the case, your thinking and behavior may have come about as a compensation. There are better ways to deal with it.You do have a talent for writing as demonstrated by your clear letter. But even the solitary task of writing is usually for and about other people. We have to live life in order to have things to write about.I think you deserve better than you’ve got right now. Narcissus, the character in Greek legend and the person for whole narcissism is named, loved himself as you do and it caused his death. People are not meant to narrow their world and their love to only themselves. When they do, it results in a kind of mental atrophy and the world becomes a very lonely place.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am a gay male and have been out and confident in my sexuality for over 3 years now. However in the past year or so I have become unable to imagine myself in sexual situations with men I find attractive, or even men I don’t personally find attractive. [/INST]  Sex can be a very animalistic act but for humans it is always more than that. The physical sensations that arise from sexual activity and sexual arousal are filtered, modified and perhaps re-created, all within the domain of the conscious mind. Everything that pertains to you, to your mind, to your development, to your experiences both sexual and otherwise, to recallable memories and also those that have been submerged into the unconscious mind, all of these things interact with the physical to produce human sexuality.You are both anxious and depressed. Either of these, could have profound effects upon your sexuality both actual and in fantasy. It would be unrealistic to expect that your anxiety, depression, insecurity, lowered self-esteem, etc., would not have a powerful effect upon your sexuality.As much as we Americans would like to think that we are completely liberated and accepting of homosexuality and gender issues, we certainly are not. Is there universal agreement that someone who identifies themselves as male or female, can use the bathroom reserved for their identified gender? Of course not and our elections surely show that difference. Is homosexuality a vile perversion that condemns its practitioners to hell? Does God hate homosexuals? There are millions of people that say no to both of those questions, but there are also millions of individuals who say yes.We are surely moving towards a more enlightened view of sexuality but our country is still in transition. We have yet to reach that enlightened destination. You presently exist in that mixed American culture. Could the negativity expressed by many individuals, in our society, towards homosexuality be affecting you, especially at a time of anxiety and depression?Yes, of course it could.The first thing to address is your anxiety and depression and all issues pertaining to it. A good therapist will make all the difference in the world. I believe that as you make progress in those areas your sexual issues will also improve. If you follow this process and your sexual issues do not resolve themselves, then you can, of course, see a sex therapist.In my humble opinion, your sexual problems will be resolved when the more fundamental mental health issues are corrected. I hope I’ve provided some insight into your concerns and I wish you the best of luck. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am the divorced mother of a 16-year-old daughter. My husband and I split up when she was 8. Since she first began to speak, she has always called me and my husband by our first names. She is my only child and I have always wanted so much to be called “mom” or “mommy” or whatever. I’ve never made a big thing about it till my birthday just recently, when I told her the best birthday present she could give me would be to call me “mom,” even if it was just for one day. She refused. [/INST]  Little children copy what they hear and please the people they depend on. My guess is that she initially called you by your first name because she heard other people address you that way. For some reason, you didn’t correct her or play with her using lots of phrases like “come to mommy” when you talked to her. Maybe you thought it was cute at first. Maybe you didn’t think it was such a big deal at the time. Or maybe you didn’t understand how other people establish what they are called. Later on, when stepkids entered your life, I’m guessing that they called you by your first name too – which only reinforced that you are called by your name. Whatever the reason, or combination of reasons, your daughter now has 16 years of thinking about you and calling you by your given name instead of by “mom.”I don’t think she doesn’t love you. I think she’s worried that she loves you too much. Being a teenager, she needs to find some way to declare herself as an individual. She is declaring her independence by pushing at you – hard. One of the ways is by refusing your request. Meanwhile she refers to you as “mom” to others which shows you that she does value the relationship.You’ve done a great job of parenting her as shown by the fact that she is wonderful in almost every way – except at home. That this is normal doesn’t make it any less painful for us moms when we’re going through it with our teens. Hold on to the fact that she’s so lovely and accomplished. Love her, no matter what but do let her know when she’s crossed the line and been disrespectful. Have faith that the closeness you had is still in there somewhere. It will come back out sometime in her twenties. I wouldn’t be surprised if someday when maybe you’ve given up on it, she starts calling you “Mom.”I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: Hello! I’m going to give some background information in order to give insight to my current situation. When I was 4 or 5, I was diagnosed with “borderline” autism (autistic traits) because I had communication, behavioral, and sensory problems that were autistic/Asperger’s in flavor, but did not reach the bar for a diagnosis. Through speech and occupational therapy, I was successful in overcoming these symptoms, and have had a successful and uneventful life, having graduated both high school and college and forming many friendships along the way. [/INST]  You are a success story. Do you know that? Early intervention like you were fortunate to receive as a small child often helps children overcome autistic-like traits. That’s great.I suspect your loved ones are referring to that early assessment because they don’t know how to help when you hit a rough patch and they take some comfort in having an “explanation” for your problems. The problem, then, isn’t your old diagnosis, but rather that the people who love you are upset that they don’t know how to help you.The way out of this is to acknowledge their caring and to remind them that their love and support is all you need. You can also reassure them by following through on your intention to see a therapist. I’m sure that you are smart enough and insightful enough to make use of what the therapist has to offer.As for your friend: I don’t think she is a “foe”. My guess is that she was trying to be helpful but made a mistake based on very out-dated information in your case. (If you were truly autistic, her advice would make sense.) Mistakes are human. We all make them now and then. She has generally been very helpful to you as only a good friend can be. Good friends are hard to find. Hold onto her. Have a heart to heart conversation with her about how her suggestion hasn’t been helpful and bring her up to date on your progress and successes.As for being “different”: The fact is that we are all different in one way or another. Often it is those differences that make us interesting and even exciting to others. You lost sight of that somewhere along the line and your self-esteem has suffered. Do talk to the therapist about this. You can recover from that diminished self-esteem just as you recovered from autistic-like traits.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I previously was in an unhealthy relationship on and off for about 5 months. we weren’t in love and it was mostly just a sexual relationship — I lost my virginity to him the first night, I realize my choices led to me to this place and I fully accept the responsibility for the heartbreak and the sadness that I have because of these decisions. [/INST]  Thank you for your email. I think you can get closure without having to talk to him directly again. The method is through expressive writing. I would write him a letter that is complete with all your thoughts, feelings and reactions. Don’t hold anything back. Expressive writing is one way to organize, express, and integrate our feelings when we need closure. It is safe — when you write the letter I would focus on both what you received in the relationship that was good, and what your disappointments were that diminished it and ultimately ended it. This will help you find more of what you want and less of what you don’t in your future relationships. Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve finished up my bachelor’s degree in psychology and I’m applying to PhD programs in clinical psychology. All the cards are in my favor because I am an excellent student and have prepared myself well with research and clinical experience. However, I am scared that I will make a terrible therapist because of my personal problems. [/INST]  You seem to possess many desirable qualities of a good psychologist. You’re empathetic and a good listener. As you mentioned, you’re kind, understanding and sympathetic. Hearing about other people’s troubles makes you want to help them. You’re motivated for all the right reasons to be a helping professional.With regard to your personal problems I don’t think it’s unusual for individuals with their own issues to be attracted to the field of psychology. It’s actually pretty common. It shouldn’t drive you away from the field. You should, however, make a concerted effort to correct the problems you’re dealing with. Depression, anxiety, and OCD do not occur in a vacuum. Something is causing these disorders and you need to find out what it is and find a way to correct it. It’s not enough to just manage these disorders. You need to cure them or at least be working on curing them in your own treatment.Carl Jung, the famous psychoanalyst, had a good comment with regard to this topic. He wrote that “the psychotherapist, however, must understand not only the patient; it is equally important that he should understand himself…The patients’ treatment begins with the doctor, so to speak. Only if the doctor knows how to cope with himself and his own problems will he be able to teach the patient to do the same. Only then.”I believe this quote to be infinitely insightful and very accurate. If you are bogged down with your own issues you won’t be able to help another individual more than you’ve been able to help yourself. It may also be true that if you’re unable to help yourself then you’ll be ineffective in helping others.Your experiences with depression, anxiety and OCD may provide valuable insight that perhaps another therapist, who had not experienced these issues, would not have. You should use that to your advantage. However, as a responsible adult and a therapist-in-training, who is seeking to make it their life’s work to solve the problems of others, it’s incumbent upon you to be as psychologically healthy as possible.If you decide to stay in psychology and you’re accepted into a PhD program it will take years to complete this process. That leaves you plenty of time to work on these issues. You know what you want, you’re interested in the field and you seem to possess the characteristics of an effective counselor. From my vantage point, it seems like you’re pursuing the correct career path but first consider seeking help for yourself. </s>"

These thoughts would not go away and by the end of the night i assumed something was wrong with me i was scared i would turn into a murderer. [/INST]  Looks to me like you’re a bit of a slow learner. Some people seem to be able to handle alcohol and drugs. You obviously can’t. Stop fooling around with substances that change you in negative ways and start looking for help in places that are helpful in positive ways.Your default mode when stressed seems to be avoidance and depression. You need to develop some coping skills for handling stress and tough decisions. I strongly urge you to see a mental health professional, not because I think you have a mental illness but because counselors can help young people figure themselves out and can teach you now to manage your stress and the ADD that makes it hard for you to focus.You’ve already taken the first important step by cutting out alcohol and drugs and starting to exercise. That’s great. It makes your mind available for what a counselor can tell you. Now, please, take the next step and get the help you need to become all you can be.I wish you well.  </s>"

"<s>[INST] My 19 year old son, just barely graduated high school. Since graduating he has had many jobs and quit each one because it was their fault. He has not gotten a new job in 6 months, he hasn’t done anything about going to school , but says he wants to go to cooking school. His girl friend’s mother seems to be a huge influence in his life, she acts like a teenager herself. On many occasions I have asked for her help with things concerning my son, but she does the opposite. He has pushed his family away and spends no time at home. He seems to have no desire to do anything for himself for his future and is more concerned with his girlfriend’s future. She graduates this year. I have tried no pressure and pressure to get to him, I don’t know what to do to get through. He avoids me and just doesn’t listen to me. He yes me but I know it doesn’t sink in at all. [/INST]  Your son has some major growing up to do. Right now, his girlfriend’s mom looks like a whole lot more fun than you do. Of course, that’s because she is as immature as he is. Unfortunately, she gives him justification for writing you off.You are under no obligation to support him now that he is out of high school. You and your husband need to come to agreement about what behavior you will and will not accept. Be absolutely clear about it. Ultimatums are only powerful if you really, really mean them.Then, if you can bring yourself to do it, inform your son that you will only continue to support him if he is in school and getting decent grades or if he is working and paying you a reasonable amount for room and board. Remind him that you deserve to retire at some point and that you’ve done your job of parenting him. If you decide to go this route, it will be hard to stay firm. You do love him. You don’t want to alienate him. But sometimes tough love is the only thing that shoves someone out of taking advantage of a situation.Do understand that he may have a tantrum and move out to live with the girlfriend. That’s okay. A little reality is good for him. My guess is that the mom will eventually tire of supporting him financially and tripping over him in her house.Do let your son know that you love him and want what’s best for him. Remind him that if he is willing to commit to being responsible, you are willing to offer him a home. If he chooses to move out, let him know that you still love him (it’s only the truth) and that you certainly hope he’ll drop by once an awhile.Transitions are tough. You remember that from birthing him. Some kids seem to require another big push to get out and to get on with their lives.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m married to my husband for almost 9 years. We know each other 11 years. For the outside world, we are perfect couple, who loves adventure, travel, cooking and is madly in love. Behind the door is a different story. In the past 10 years, we’ve been straggling with my husband’s father, who had a stroke and now has a cancer. We were helping my in-laws in their difficult times. [/INST]  For your entire married life and throughout your 20s, you and your husband have been trying to help your in-laws manage your father-in-law’s illness. I wonder if your husband feels like life is passing him by while he does the right thing. Taking care of someone day in and day out can make a person feel emotionally drained. I’m guessing that your husband’s alcohol problems started because he found that a drink could relax him at the end of a challenging day. It has since progressed to being a way to check out from the reality of his life. Make no mistake, what you are describing at this point is alcohol abuse.To manage the stress of caregiving successfully, a caregiver needs to be sure to take care of themselves and move forward in their own lives. Your husband isn’t doing either. He also seems to be trying to recapture his more carefree youth by contacting the ex-girlfiriend. He’s in serious trouble.You can try talking to him. Instead of being upset and accusatory, try being compassionate about the position he finds himself in. His life is going nowhere. Talk about how the two of you can get additional help with your father-in-law so your husband isn’t the only support person. Look around for a caregivers support group. Many hospitals and hospice organizations sponsor such groups. It’s important to have a place where it’s okay to share feelings and where information about helpful services is exchanged. Then work together to figure out how your husband can reclaim his own life’s direction. Does he need to go back to school? To find a job that is more gratifying?Finally, you need to tell your husband in as loving a way as possible that although you understand the urge to drink, it’s gotten way out of control. Ask him what he is going to do about it. If he continues to deny that there is a problem, tell him the truth: You can’t make him stop drinking but you don’t have to stay around for it. Then get yourself to an Al-Anon meeting to learn how to detach from his problem. Here’s the website.Yes, self-care takes time and attention; time that is hard to come by when caring for someone else. But if your husband isn’t taking care of himself, he is doing something else.

I told a parent about it and they told me that my stress was self inflicted and that I needed to fix my problems rather than run from them. They gave me a list of mental illnesses and reasons for why the illnesses may have happened. I read up on them and identified with them and saw that some people never heal from them and that petrified me into thinking it was no hope for me. That I would be that 1% I tried a self help program and it didn’t do much help because I was scared it was a scam because I couldn’t find any credible information about the program and because the guy who told me about it seems like a pathological liar. I was shook outta my mind realizing it didn’t work for me. A hospital psychiatrist and school therapist said I don’t have schizophrenia. I still have this fear even after hearing that. Ill explain the symptoms I recognize with: I went thru a phase where me and a friend were trying to unlock more than 10%of our brain and thought we could flow our energy in our body by thinking about it. After finding out what a delusion was I quickly realized I shouldn’t even keep trying this.I also believed in 1 too many conspiracy theories and thought that the gov. harmed people that were trying to do positive. I had a really positive idea that could help the world and fear they may come after me for working on it. I quickly dropped that idea too. Now when Im reading tweets I read them a little too quickly and my brain changes words around. This only happens with tweets and when Im stressing about going schizophrenic (almost 24/7now) Ive started having nightmares about my worst fears Anytime I get scared I think ima paranoid schizophrenic now. I’m always scared my thoughts will turn into delusions I fear any low noise that might mean Im hearing something None of this has gone on for more than 6months. Am I losing it? PS I smoked a lot of marijuana prior to the anxiety attack [/INST]  The nature of anxiety is to excessively worry. Anecdotally it seems that many people with anxiety disorders worry about getting schizophrenia. In fact, it’s one of the most common questions that I receive.A related common question that I receive involves using marijuana and subsequently developing psychiatric symptoms. Some studies suggest that smoking marijuana increases the risk for psychosis and for that reason it’s a dangerous drug to use.Psychosis involves a break with reality. People with schizophrenia have psychotic episodes but not everyone who experiences psychosis has schizophrenia. Some people have one psychotic episode and never have another. Usually those cases involve drug abuse or a physical condition.The bottom line is this: people who use drugs, including marijuana, have an increased risk of psychosis when compared to people who do not use drugs. It is best to avoid drugs if you want to preserve your mental health.You stated that a hospital psychiatrist and a school therapist said that you don’t have schizophrenia. That should give you some peace of mind. If the experts don’t believe you have it (the people who are trained to know), then you should believe the experts. If you continue to worry, you might try seeking a second or a third opinion.Finally, if you have an anxiety disorder, you should seek treatment. Once your anxiety is under control, these fears might dissipate. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello there…I am a 15 year old female…I just started high school in my country and here for the past 5 months I have been dealing with a serious problem…You see I tend to hear voices every single day. It wasn’t that much of a problem before..But it sure is now…I hear them INSIDE of my head although sometimes I can HEAR them with my ears. But only a few words such as “never” “die” “kill” or even a yell. Most of the time though they tend to be internal.I repeat they are NOT my voice. They consist of a female voice with a british accent,who I call Mary, and a male voice I call Adonis. Adonis is really aggressive and mean to me and others. He tells me I’m a worthless person who was sent by him to kill as many as possible. I don’t listen to him of course. But it makes it really difficult for me to trust anyone. Mary is appearing much less than Adonis but she can make everything shake. It feels like the earth is moving, I tend to twitch my body parts (etc: head,palms) and have an extreme anger for no reason at all. They say I got to do what they tell me in order to survive. Adonis says he will hurt me and Mary tells me she’ll possess me. Sometimes I tend to see Mary walk around in reflections of almost anything and even get a glimpse of her in the corner of my eye. I often tend to confuse what’s real and what’s not..I feel lost. I have also never done drugs or have I ever done alcohol abuse. I just want help and answers…I am also scared of my parents finding out. The voices tell me that they’ll hurt me and that they put someone to watch me. Spy on me. And kill me. I know they aren’t real.But I can’t take it anymore. Please please help me. [/INST]  I would agree that the voices you described are concerning. You don’t recognize them, and they are oppressive and mean. I understand that you are fearful of reporting your symptoms, but you must tell your parents. Keeping this a secret will only make your situation worse.If you feel uncomfortable speaking to your parents, then give them this letter. If that does not work, then speak to the school guidance counselor or a trusted faculty member. They should be able to help you.There are effective treatments that can reduce or eliminate the voices, but you can only access those treatments if you reveal your symptoms. Don’t let fear hold you back from seeking the necessary treatment that could eliminate these symptoms from your life. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: About four years ago I was released from a psychiatric hospital after a month, and my mom had picked me up. I was looking at the papers and I saw under diagnosis, along with what I had been diagnosed with before was ‘psychosocial’. I asked my mom what that mean and she said it meant I have no social skills. I could had told you that! [/INST]  Please relax. Psychosocial is not a diagnosis. It’s a category for assessment. In your case, it looks like someone wrote it in the wrong place on a form. To do a “psychosocial” merely means to take a brief history of someone’s psychological and social development. It provides an overview of your issues to those who are trying to help you.As far as I’m concerned, diagnoses are only a way to quickly and broadly summarize someone’s issues and to direct appropriate medication treatment. After you get a diagnosis, you still have the problems that distress you. If you want to get better, it’s up to you to do the hard work with your therapist.A therapist can provide guidance and support, but you need to do the daily work. People improve when they do two things: 1) They make the life style changes they need to make to be physically healthy and 2) They work hard in their therapy to better understand themselves so they can make healthier life choices.Please stop being so worried about what is on a piece of paper from years ago. Focus your attention instead on what you can do now to be an active member of your treatment team.I understand your reluctance to see another therapist if you’ve had a negative experience. But, please, therapists are no more alike than other people. Give therapy a chance. Make an initial appointment with another therapist. If you don’t feel comfortable with him or her, bring it up. Sometimes talking about the discomfort is what inspires insight into other relationships as well. If you feel you aren’t being helped, go for a second opinion to a different therapist. If that one doesn’t work out either, it’s only fair to ask yourself if the problem lies within you, not the therapists. That may be the very issue you need to work on.I wish you well. </s>"
"<s>[INST] So about 3 years ago i pretty much found God. Before that, i was not religious at all. I was always a good person however. After i found God i feel like my mind opened up to a whole new world like i became more aware of the world and everything like a brick hit me in my face. I became a much better person thank god. But it also came along with other things like being paranoid, i always think people are talking bad about me. I also find i can’t really communicate with people like i use to only certain people i can talk to and its very.very few. Im constantly always thinking about life and the here after and god but life mostly. How i found god was so unexpected and i wish it didn’t happen that way cause now to add to my problems im suffering from a broken heart. I converted for a guy, but actually started believing in everything i was learning. Im glad i found god and Im glad to see the changes i needed to make with myself no doubt, but it came along with negative things. Social problems, always worrying, constantly thinking about stuff just stuff random stuff and life, a bit paranoid. I also have mood swings.from time to time. Sometimes i get happy and when i notice Im happy i feel bad about it and kinda get sad, that’s happened since before though. Im not the same person i use to be some for better but some for.worse, i try telling myself Im going through changes and i will find myself , i know Im not crazy and it sucks cause i feel like some people who know what’s going on think i am crazy and Im scared Im being pushed.to just be by myself, in scared.this will be a problem to where i.can’t.get.married or.have any friends. I thought all i needed to do was talk about.it and it seems to help but now i feel like my friends are getting tired of listening even my family. And i don’t want to bother them or run them away. I just want to be okay. I don’t want to go back to how i use to be. I use to smoke marijuana too overnight for years straight but stopped a few months ago.thank god. I use to be able to handle it now when i smoke i.get so paranoid and worry so i just stopped all together.thank god. I just want to know what’s wrong with me? I want to know if i went crazy? Can i save myself? [/INST]  It is difficult to know what might be wrong. When you became aware of God, something about that new awareness may have frightened you. Perhaps you became aware of how fragile life truly is.You might also be experiencing a type of existential anxiety. There are many definitions but generally speaking, existential anxiety refers to the anxiety one feels when they become aware of their being and the possibility of non-being (death).It is difficult to know with certainty what may have happened but it seems that a definite change has occurred. As you stated, some of the changes were good and some were not. You did not explain the good changes. The changes that concern you include: paranoia, anxiety, mood swings, and difficulty interacting with friends and family.Among others, one specific question you asked is whether you can save yourself. The answer is yes. The proper way to handle this situation is to be evaluated by a mental health professional. An evaluation can determine if your symptoms are indicative of a mental health disorder. Anxiety and paranoia do not develop in a vacuum. It is important to determine their origin and to develop a plan of action. The good news is that your symptoms can be treated with talk therapy, medication or both.Consider choosing a therapist who is familiar with your faith or who is spiritually oriented. Many mental health professionals incorporate faith and spirituality into their practices. Interview several therapists and choose the one that you feel the most comfortable with. The “find help” tab at the top of this page can help you find a mental health professional in your community. You may only need a few sessions to address your concerns. I wish you the best. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m a 38-year-old man who likes being unhappy. I have no idea why I like being unhappy. To be fair I do have challenges that make me this way, but I think my problem is I enjoy being sad. Is that possible? [/INST]  The way that you have described this leads me to believe that you are not happy being unhappy –but rather that you are familiar with the feeling. Being familiar with an emotion is not the same as being okay with it. Rather it indicates that feeling is the dominant one, and the one you have had the most experience with. I would strongly recommend individual psychotherapy at this point as the conditions that point to a a situation that may likely be improved by therapy.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Since I started college in a different state than my home, I isolated myself to focus on school; I decided that I would just focus on academics and not socialize. As a result, I have made no friends in college and there are days, and sometimes weeks, that go by where I don’t talk to a single person. What drove me to continue isolating myself like this was the fact that I was doing well academically. However, I started realizing that all this time in isolation forced me to constantly focus on negative thoughts and I saw a significant decrease in my cognitive ability; things I could previously do quickly in high school took a lot longer now. When I entered the fall semester of my sophomore year in college, the coursework really picked up and I saw myself doing poorly on one exam after another; it really took a toll on me and I just became more and more discouraged after each failure. The day I got a 27/100 on an organic chemistry exam was the day that it all went downhill. From this day onward, I don’t feel stress anymore; stress is what previously drove me to get my work done and do well on exams. My brain is preventing me from focusing now, because of how discouraged I have become. I spend hours upon hours studying, but I’m never efficient because I don’t feel stress; this has become a cycle and is really taking a toll on me. I can’t seem to figure out what’s wrong with me. [/INST]   I can appreciate you wanting to make school a priority — and can understand why the low test grade was so difficult for you emotionally. Anxiety is a necessary element of performance. It operates like a violin string. If it is too much or too little we don’t aren’t in tune.The counseling center at your university is used to that his type of reaction with students. They understand what it takes to perform well and can help you get the right balance back. I would make an initial appointment with them and let them know what is happening. They can help.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I’m – 18 y/o, diagnosed at 3 y/o with Tourettes Syndrome and later with OCD and Anxiety. [/INST]  At 18 years old, you say that “recently (3 or 4 years)” you’ve been struggling. Do the math. Three or four years is 16 – 25% of your life! That’s a cause for concern. Since you haven’t been professionally diagnosed since you were three years old, I urge you to stop trying to do so on our own.It’s long past time for an evaluation. Look for someone who has some expertise in late diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of a letter, of course. But what you say suggests ASD should be considered. It’s not at all unusual for people who are on the high functioning end of the spectrum to be misdiagnosed or to go without a diagnosis for years.Regardless of whether you are on the autism spectrum, there is something amiss. A licensed clinician will determine a diagnosis, help you understand yourself and present you with a treatment plan. You can then discuss how you want to go forward in your own healing.At 18, you have a long life ahead of you. Getting treatment now for whatever is distressing you will make it likely that you can have the productive, calm adult life you desire.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  Hello, I just found out that my boyfriend, who I thought I had a serious relationship with, for almost 11 months cheated on me a 1 month ago with a friend of mine from work who was also in a relationship and I knew her boyfriend. We all work together and she texted me 6 days ago what happened. Since we work together, my boyfriend and I have spent almost every day together. When we first started dating, I was applying for PA school all over the country and he knew of the possibility of me moving to another state but we continued. I was accepted to PA school in NY a few months ago and we were going back in forth about him moving with me eventually to NY. I went to NY for 4 days, 1 month ago to visit some friends and on the last night before I returned, he went out with my friend, slept with her, she left his apartment in the morning then he came to pick me up at the airport 2 hours later saying I missed you and love you!

Here are the facts as you’ve related them to me:You need someone more dedicated to you than he is. 6 weeks isn’t that long in the scheme of things. My advice is do everything you can to wrap up this phase of your life, and use the move to transition into a life with better friends, and a better boyfriend.You may want to get a list of the books that are going to be required in your first classes in PA school and begin reading. Typically the course load is full the first semester. Why not get started on something that you know have direct value in your life. Shift your attention to your needs and goals, and begin detaching from him emotionally. There isn’t much he has to offer at this point other than his empty words without action.When you get to the new school you can take advantage of their counseling center if you need to.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"

"<s>[INST] For about 10 years I have been struggling with depersonalization and anxiety and up until now I have been able to live with it. Recently after having my wisdom teeth out I had a very bad panic episode and started reading about schizophrenia and woke up in the middle of the night with intrusive thoughts of hurting my fiancé. I had slight auditory hallucination one night that I knew where inside my head and not real in addition to very vivid dreams and have had a slight paranoia thinking that people hate me. I did a lot of research and found that I might be suffering from ocd and I have been meeting with a ocd specialist and have told him all of my concerns and he has told me that I have ocd, anxiety, and depression. I fear that I am losing touch with reality because it seems my symptoms are getting worse. I feel emotionally numb and have constant night sweats and have had no appetite for over three weeks. Since I was 20 I have had episodic fears that I have angered god and that the devil is out to ruin my life. Overall I just feel crazy and feel very detached from myself like someone else has inhabited my body and mind. I have been to several therapists over the years and none of them think that I have a psychotic disorder. The most worrying symptom is that I feel like time has sped up, it feels like 15 minutes had gone by while in actuality 2 hours have past. Usually I have years where I feel 100 percent normal and then every 2 to 3 years I have an episode where I feel crazy for about eight months. I really have no clue what to do about all of this, talk therapy has never helped and every day I just feel further away from the happy person that I used to be. I just want these intrusive thoughts to go away so that I can go along with my life. Do you thinking checking myself into the hospital would be a good idea at this point? [/INST]  I’m sorry that you are suffering. You stated that you have been in therapy for years and it has not helped. Medication might be useful in treating your symptoms.With regard to checking yourself into a hospital, typically, in order to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital, an individual has to be homicidal or suicidal, or in grave danger of imminent death due to their psychiatric symptoms. This is true in most cases. Even if admitted to the hospital, your stay would likely be brief, especially if you are not actively exhibiting suicidal or homicidal thoughts. Alternatively, you may be able to check in to a private psychiatric facility but there are potential drawbacks. It might not be reimbursable by your health insurance company and it could be very expensive. You may want to call the hospital or your insurance company directly for more details.A hospital stay is a short-term solution but you may need something more for this long-standing problem. Medication might be the solution. Some people are reluctant to take medication but they shouldn’t be. There are many psychiatric medications that specifically target the symptoms you have described. A low dose of medication might significantly reduce your symptoms. You may only need it temporarily. Many people regard medication as a “lifesaver.” It could help you immensely. Discuss this option with your treatment providers. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] my nephew is 5yrs old. I have caught him touching his younger sister inappropriately several times. I have told his mother my sister and she has dealt with it the best way she knows how. I think a lot of the reason he’s acting this way is because of her relationship with him. he’s to clingy, always wants to be the center of her attention & when his sister has her attention, he immediately wants it on him. Also her husband and herself discipline my nephew way differently then they do my niece. I don’t know if it’s because he’s not really my nephew’s dad, but you can tell it is messing with his head. he’s also been caught playing with a toy that goes to a kids mechanics set that vibrates and putting it on his private parts. I’m not exactly sure if that’s appropriate seeing as how he’s been acting out. [/INST]  Your nephew is very lucky to have you as an aunt. Your statement to your brother-in-law was right on target. Our job as parents and adults is to love and protect children – regardless of how we were parented.His parents don’t seem to get it that this little boy is showing every sign of being quite troubled. From what you report, it’s no wonder. Your sister and her husband are acting as if they wish that she didn’t have a prior relationship. Your nephew is evidence that she did. Your nephew isn’t stupid. He knows he is unloved and unwanted. He senses his mother’s rejection and clings to her. That only makes her reject him some more which makes him even more clingy — which makes her want to push him even further away.In addition, I worry that this little boy is being abused. 5-year-olds generally don’t know about touching another person sexually. Often (not always, but often), it means that someone has touched them that way. Another possibility is that he quite accidentally discovered that touching his sister or himself in certain ways finally gets him the attention he craves.As difficult as it may be, I think you should be contacting children’s protective services. Leaving him for 3 days at a time is abandonment. I’m not sure what you mean by “discipline” but if it is harsh, you may be skirting around the fact that it’s abuse. His sexual acting out may indicate something even more serious going on. Whatever the case, this little boy needs an evaluation and help.I realize that calling in authorities can be terribly disruptive to relationships in the family. But if he is being abused, it needs to stop. I don’t have the whole story, of course. If you are uncertain about whether you should be taking action, it might be helpful for you to first talk to your nephew’s pediatrician or to make an appointment with a therapist to seek some advice and support.I wish you well.  </s>"

She however hates physical activity. She is very bright. Volunteers and takes pride in it. Also has 2 younger brothers and feels annoyed with them often. She is a great kid, but it’s very hard for us to have her try new things unless she wants, participates in several school clubs. As a parent should I be concerned? Her father is an extremely ambitious, driven man and she gets a bit anxious around him. Although he never forces his opinion on her, but he comes across as a little pushy.

[/INST]  From what you describe here, it doesn’t really sound like there is a serious problem, except that your daughter may not be as active as you hope. It sounds like she is a pretty well-rounded adolescent who is doing well in school, volunteers and has a group of friends. It’s not always a good thing for adolescents to be overly involved in too many activities because something will have to give, be it grades, sleep, peers or family time.Since you and your husband are in therapy, it would be easy to ask her if she would like to see someone too in order to work on her confidence and social anxiety, but it honestly doesn’t sound like it’s holding her back all that much. I think the choice should be hers at this point. Otherwise, yes, just be there for her and allow her to blossom.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] My mother has suffered from depression for more than 35 years. My mother got post partum depression after she had her first child in 1972. and back then they didn’t know as much about it so it went untreated for probably 20 years. i don’t remember exactly when she was diagnosed but she has tried everything. she has been on every medication under the sun. then later she was diagnosed with bipolar and has tried another multitude of medications and nothing seems to work. she is just miserable always saying she wished she was dead in front of everybody. she never wants to go out of the house and always says how unhappy she is. i have been telling her she needs to get a second opion but where we are there are not alot of advanced phychatrists all they want to do is push more pills at her. and i don’t think pills will help her. i don’t know where to go. or how to get her to go with me. [/INST]  It is very difficult to help someone who is resistant to treatment. You cannot force them to do something that they don’t want to do. The only time you can force a person into treatment is when they are a danger to themselves or to others. Short of that, there are limited options.Try suggesting to your mother that she see a psychotherapist instead of a psychiatrist. This doesn’t mean that she should avoid psychiatrists but that she might be willing to try a new approach. She has tried a multitude of medications and has had very little success. Maybe psychotherapy would help her.Seeing a therapist is a very different experience than seeing a psychiatrist. Many psychiatrists do not provide talk therapy. They tend to focus on medication. Psychotherapists, on the other hand, focus entirely on talk therapy. Psychotherapy can be quite an effective treatment, especially when it is combined with psychiatric medication. If she tries a new treatment approach, it might help to decrease her depression.You might want to also suggest group therapy. Many local community mental health centers have group therapy sessions at very affordable rates. Some groups might even be free. Many people find that group therapy is a very effective approach to treating depression.If your mother is not interested in any kind of treatment, then realize you have done all that you can. As mentioned above, you can’t force someone into treatment. I understand that it is difficult to watch a loved one suffer but unfortunately you are limited in how you can affect this situation. Ultimately, whether or not she wants to treat her depression is her choice. Hopefully, for her sake and for the sake of those who care about her, she chooses treatment. I wish you the best.

"<s>[INST] I’m a 29 year old; I have my degree in psychology. I’m hoping for some insight on why I might be having the thoughts and feelings that I do about my own physical appearance. Although I don’t talk about it, I am inwardly obsessed with the idea of people finding me attractive. I understand that a lot of women probably feel this way, as we’ve had the importance of beauty bombarding us from all sides as we’ve grown up. But I believe that my thoughts and feelings are much stronger, more intense, and probably abnormal in some ways. I’ve been both bulimic and anorexic on and off since I was 15. I’m aware of the general understanding that eating disorders are often about control. I’ve spent a lot of time reflecting on why I have the issues with food that I do, and I’m positive that for me, it’s not about control but solely about wanting to be physically desirable. I often go through phases where I obsess about getting plastic surgery. I’ve gone so far as to meet with a plastic surgeon and to look into taking out a loan, but my husband wasn’t in support of the idea and in the end, I’m not frantic enough about it to put us into debt over it. The ONLY thing that turns me on sexually, is to be complimented on my physicality. If a stranger online compliments me, I’m instantly horny. I’m a staunch feminist, and I wouldn’t say this in any other forum as I believe that it would minimize the more important voices of woman who feel threatened by it, but I love being cat called. I don’t care at all if people compliment my intelligence or sense of humor. It ALMOST feels like an insult when they do because I’d prefer them to be complimenting my appearance in some way. While at one point in my life I was definitely consumed by self-hatred, I don’t feel that way anymore. On most days I feel pretty neutral about my appearance. I just have this deep, deep seated yearning to be praised for my physical beauty. It seems like the only thing that really satisfies me or makes me feel (what feels like genuine) happiness. Developmentally, what could have happened to me to make me this way? (From Canada) [/INST]   First, I applaud your courage in being so open and reflective of your own process. Whatever it is that will help — you have already shown the first ingredient in the process of healing and transformation. I am not sure looking to the past will help us as much as understanding what is happening now. To reframe this and to use the survey on character strengths perspective (via character.org) if you haven’t taken this survey I think it would be helpful) you are overusing your strength of appreciation of beauty and excellence. In other words, you have taken a normal element of your character and are using it to the degree that it is causing anxiety. Since you are in the profession and I think it would be helpful, there is a very recent article I can share with you that will show you how the overuse of the character strengths can lead to social anxiety. I encourage you to check this out and see if it makes sense: Positive psychopathology: Social anxiety via character strengths underuse and overuse.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"

"<s>[INST] I really need some advice…I am in love with and involved with a married woman…she initiated the relationship…are first date was supposed to be harmless then one thing led to another and we slept together…we both have very strong feelings for each other and as time goes on we become very close friends and share everything with each other and her 3 kids adore me and I them…she says that she is no longer in love with her marriage but still has feeling for her husband in spite of all his wrong doings…she also tells me that i am amazing and super sweet and do a lot of things so much better then him..like being there for her and her kids and giving her emotional support and being a great listener… [/INST]  I’m so sorry for your pain. There must be something very sweet about this woman for you to be so head over heels in love with her. But I have to tell you this: You aren’t losing her. You can’t lose what you never had. She’s married. She’s not being honest with her husband and she’s not being honest with you. She’s trying to have it both ways: A husband who supports her and their family and a young, romantic lover. She’s beginning to come to her senses but you’re not letting her leave easily. She seems to understand that what for her was a fun affair is much more serious for you. Her efforts to leave gracefully due to your illness are being thwarted by your unwillingness to let her go. However much in love you may be, it’s unwise to let your heart rule your head. She’s nowhere near as invested in a future together as you are. And remember this: A woman who will cheat with you will probably end up doing it to you.Grieve this relationship, learn from it, and make yourself available to women your own age who are looking for someone just like you. There are women out there who would give anything to find a guy who is loving, loyal, and willing to commit himself utterly to the person he loves. Give yourself the chance to find someone who is going to love you back in the same way.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Indonesia: Hi, I have been together with my girlfriend for over than 2 years. And now we were in long distance relationship. It has never been an issue for us because we trust and love each other. [/INST]  I am so sorry that you and your girlfriend are going through this difficult time. But I would completely honor the fact that she is confused and is not position to make a full commitment. I wouldn’t try to change her mind about this — or overextend yourself. I would negotiate very brief amount of time for her to make a decision after which you should move on. Maybe 30 or 60 days but certainly not much more than that. Give her a very short time to sort through these issues but make it clear that you are giving her this time and space, but you’re looking for a committed relationship. If she can’t make that commitment to you — you’ll want to find someone who can.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My grandmother (mother’s mother) was diagnosed with schizophrenia back in the 1960s. Although diagnosed, she was harmless and loved her family. [/INST]  This is a concerning situation. It poses a threat to your mother and to your family, given that you and she are neighbors. People who are drug-addicted are not thinking clearly. Being high increases the likelihood of unpredictable behavior, which may include violence. It is undoubtedly a high-risk situation.I don’t have many details about your mother and her condition but below are a few suggestions about how you might effectively handle this situation. The operative word is might. The reality is that you may not be able to effectively intervene, even though this is a serious problem that puts your mother, your family and perhaps other neighbors in potential danger.You asked about having her evaluated. I am assuming that she won’t be evaluated willingly.Individuals may be forced to undergo an evaluation when they pose a threat to themselves or to others. Short of that, it may be difficult or perhaps impossible to force her to have an evaluation.One could make the argument that allowing crack addicts in your home is a sign that someone is not thinking clearly and thus such poor decision-making poses a threat to themselves. But given the often-strict inpatient commitment laws in many states, it’s unlikely to be enough of a “case.”Many communities have emergency mobile crisis teams that evaluate individuals in their homes. If members of the crisis team believe that your mother is a harm to herself or to others, they can legally mandate that she undergo an evaluation at a local hospital. That may be one way to ensure that she is evaluated.Simply having her evaluated may not be enough. If it is determined, by the hospital physicians, that she is not enough of a danger to herself or to others, then she will be released.Another possibility is to call the police and report the drug activity in her home. Understandably, you do not want your mother to become involved with the law but it might be one way to ensure that drug-addicted persons stop coming to her home. This may seem harsh but the reality is that your mother is in danger primarily because her mental illness is preventing her from being able to properly care for herself. Your ultimate goal is to protect your mother. In this case, it seems as though the ends might justify the means.A long-term possibility to explore is having your mother declared incompetent. One would choose this legal option in cases in which individuals have mental illnesses so severe that they are unable to competently care for themselves. A judge would evaluate the evidence regarding your mother’s competency and objectively decide if she is able to properly care for herself.Some individuals with schizophrenia do not recognize that they are ill. Unfortunately, many mental health laws do not factor in this clinical reality. It effectively means that in too many cases, individuals with severe mental illnesses go untreated. This presents a particularly difficult challenge for families who have to witness their loved one descend into a frightening state of psychosis and are helpless to intervene.No one would argue that an individual in an advanced state of Alzheimer’s is capable of making rational, self-care decisions yet individuals in advanced stages of psychosis are treated as if they are capable of making rational, self-care decisions.I would encourage you to read the book “I Am Not Sick, I Don’t Need Help” by Xavior Amador. Amador offers strategies for how to effectively interact with individuals with schizophrenia who do not recognize that they are ill. There are no perfect solutions but many have found his book to be highly useful. You should also contact the advocacy group, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI), for further assistance.If you’d like to write back and provide more details about your mother’s situation, I’d be happy to provide you with a more specific answer. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: My daughter is currently ten months old. Her legal father (L.F.) is not her biological father (B.F.). L.F. has played a very active role in raising her. He has taken on a paternal role since day one, and she has grown to call him dada. My daughter has never met B.F. However, L.F. has now decided that he does not want to be a part of her life. Is there any potential my daughter will experience any long-term adverse effects due to the sudden loss of the bonded relationship she has formed with L.F.? [/INST]  I’m not an expert on loss for a child so young. I can imagine that she will experience her LF’s absence for a time since he has been so involved with her.I’m guessing that he is leaving due to conflict in your relationship with him. The effect of the loss of her “dad” may be outweighed by the loss of the stress in the house. A positive and nurturing relationship with you is the most valuable protective factor while you both go through this difficult transition.That being said, it is not the baby’s fault that the two of you can’t be a couple. Since he’s been a good dad to her, why not explore with him the possibility that he would continue to have a role in her life. He may have talked about rejecting her in anger with you; not because he really means it.A caring father figure is good for any child — as long as it is a real long-term commitment. If the two of you can separate any negative feelings about each other from your love for the baby, you might all benefit.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My girlfriend and I relocated together to California and, as I got a great job, she said she could work from anywhere with her job, as it is commission based. In the last 3 years, she has not been able to contribute to the expenses for anything. She does cook every night for my 2 sons, does the shopping and some lite cleaning. I have asked her to get a job, and even got to the point of telling her to get a job, and she will look for a week, and then give up. We have had to move 4 times, I lost my car, my credit is shot, I live in a small apartment now, and she is working for her commission job, but not making any money! She just won’t look for a job that pays regularly. Then her sister moved in with us on a temporary note, and now she is going to have to have her sister move in with us because her sister is sick and can no longer take care of herself. [/INST] Thank you for writing. I’m sure this is all very distressing. But I think you need to listen to the people who know you well and who are doing their best to help you. I can tell you that in my experience Anafranil has been very helpful to some of my patients who also are challenged with OCD.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a young man in the U.S.: It seems like every summer my parents start arguing. At first, we thought it was just normal married problems but when we got older we realized that every summer my mom’s attitude flips and this time has been the worst. While my dad, of course, is not completely innocent my mom seems to be having mental problems that are the basis for the arguing. [/INST] I’m so, so sorry your mother has been so ill for so long. You didn’t indicate when this started. But you did provide enough information for me to suggest a thorough evaluation by both a medical doctor and a psychiatrist. It could be that her medical condition is contributing to this behavior. It’s also possible that she has a significant mental illness that shows up periodically. I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of only a short letter, of course. But I can tell you that since she has good periods as well as bad ones, we might want to look at a bipolar diagnosis.It’s up to your dad and the rest of the family (grandmother and aunts) to insist that she get evaluated. She is not likely to listen to you as she sees you as her child. I do suggest that your father look into what is involved in your state for her to be involuntarily signed in to a psychiatric hospital if she again becomes irrational and physically abusive. It may be the only way she gets the help she needs.I wish you all well,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a young man in South Africa: What is the emotional issues caused by my mother passing about 2 months after my birth. Simply stated in facts is that I was born in August. 1980. My father(not married or interested in me or my mom) passed away that September from diabetes. My mother then died after an horrific car accident on her way to fetch me from a state owned foster care, also in September. She was banned from her family because of me being born out of wedlock. [/INST] I’m sorry you had such a tough start in life, losing both of your biological parents before you could really bond with either. But it is unlikely that those events alone caused problems for you, especially since you were so young. It is more likely that what happened next is more relevant. If you were adopted by a caring and supportive family, you had the opportunity to thrive just as those raised by their biological parents do. If the adoptive family was toxic, that would be of more concern to a therapist than those early, early losses.An addiction that went on for almost half your life is of much more concern to me. Although you may be now clean from drugs, you may not have caught up on all the emotional, social and intellectual development that you missed during those years. I congratulate you on getting clean. I encourage you to take the next step and get into treatment to learn the developmental skills for living and loving that you missed out on while in a drug induced fog.Please take this advice. I’ve seen many people in their 30s and 40s who were able to get clean after many years. Over time, and with honest effort, they were able to reclaim the adult life they deserved. You can too.I wish you well. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in Argentina: For the past few months, I have become obsessed with a male celebrity. As a result, I am constantly browsing for videos, interviews and photos of him. The fact that there is new material of his to watch almost everyday makes it even harder to stop obsessing. It’s such a strong infatuation; he’s a highly educated, smart and funny man and I am often fantasizing about being a part of his life. They are generally romantic fantasies (never sexual), and I also invent conversations where either one is displaying some sort of intimacy, or sharing each other’s problems, and comforting one another. [/INST]  The most important statement in your letter is that you understand that your obsession is out of control and that you want it to stop. That tells me that you are probably not suffering from psychosis but rather from a form of OCD. In your anxiety and perhaps loneliness, you have landed on this obsession and the compulsions that go with it as a coping mechanism. By fantasizing about a relationship with the celebrity, you give yourself the involvement and affection that your parents aren’t able to give.You state that you are on medication, but you didn’t mention whether you are engaged in talk therapy. If you are not, I urge you to find a counselor you can trust and to work through the pain and disappointments of your growing up years. Fortunately, it really is never too late to have a happier life. With good treatment, you can learn how to disengage from your parents and to find other older, wiser people (real in your life adults, not fantasy figures) who can give you the support and involvement that everyone needs. You can also learn how to parent yourself constructively.If you are already in therapy, I hope you have discussed the extent and seriousness of the obsession with your therapist. A therapist only has the information you share to work with. It might be helpful for you to take a copy of your letter and this response to your next (or first) session to advance the conversation.You have already taken important steps toward healing by taking medication and by writing to us here at PsychCentral. I hope you will take the next steps and do the hard therapeutic work you need to do to give yourself the life you deserve.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I can’t seem to find anything on this when I search the net- sorry if this isn’t the place for it but I’m not sure where else to look. My question is, more or less, is it considered within the norm for ones go-to response when faced with a dangerous situation to be sexual offering? I Can’t put this in to context using personal experience really….it’s more of an instinctual thing? if that makes sense? I’ve never acted on it as I have never personally been in a situation that would illicit that response, but when I’m watching or reading anything scary or thrilling, I always find myself chanting; “Seduce the antagonist” in the back of my mind and honestly believe that if i were in a situation similar to the one’s I’m watching/reading, that My response would be the same. I’m a bit worried to say the least, is this predisposition at all normal? [/INST]  Thank you for your email and the courage to ask your question. The best answer I can give you is two pronged. First there is some support for the idea from an evolutionary perspective from something known as transactional sex. This means that the use of sex to obtain food, shelter and safety may have some evolutionary survival roots. More psychologically and literarily, particularly since you say: “Seduce the antagonist” you may simply be anticipating the arc of the story. Consider this article about female roles in literature. It highlights how female characters from Shakespeare through Disney have used their sexuality to manipulate outcomes.Since these are thoughts triggered from tales you are reading or watching than from your personal life I would guess this is more about your literary sensitivities.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"

"<s>[INST] Hey guys, so today I went to see a psychiatrist for the first time and I told her about all my fears and insecurities especially my fear of schizophrenia. I told her my fear of schizophrenia at least 5 different times and each and every time she told me I don’t have it,then she went on to prescribe Wellbutrin and klonopin she told me to try this and she’ll see me in 1 month. I’m just asking u guys if I can trust her opinion she didn’t run any test for schizophrenia so I’m iffy if she called that right. What do you guys think? Have any of u been on these meds before? Do they help with panic or fear? Also, i’m kind of scared of taking meds. I’ve read stories of bad experiences on meds and that they even made everything a lot worse. I really need them my anxiety has never been worse than what it is now but i’m scared that they’ll make everything a lot worse. [/INST]  The fact the you have many fears and insecurities, especially about developing schizophrenia, may indicate a potential anxiety disorder. It’s not uncommon for highly anxious people with health phobias to be particularly concerned about the development of schizophrenia. They tend to see schizophrenia as being the most severe of all mental health disorders and thus it frightens them the most.There is no official “test” to determine if one has schizophrenia. Typically, a mental health professional will review your symptoms, gather an extensive psychosocial history and make a determination about whether or not you meet the criteria for a particular disorder. The symptoms that you provided to your psychiatrist were likely checked against the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V), the accepted classification system for mental health disorders. It is the manual used by mental health professionals to diagnose disorders.There are very specific symptoms that must be present in order to receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia. These include: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior and negative symptoms (i.e. flat affect). If an individual does not have at least two of those symptoms, for a significant portion of at least one month, then they would not receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia.If it is realistic to believe that you may have schizophrenia, then it would be advantageous to receive a second opinion.People with anxiety disorders are stressed and worried about many things. That might be why you are frightened of taking medication. You may have focused too much of your attention on the potential negative aspects of taking medication. Many people with mental health disorders are greatly helped by medicine. Medications can be especially effective when treating anxiety disorders.My recommendation is to try the medication your psychiatrist has prescribed and keep careful track of how it makes you feel. Your doctor will likely start you on a low dose of the medication. Changes may be made depending upon how you react to the medication and how it affects your symptoms.It’s important to note that when beginning a new medication, you may experience negative side effects but in most cases they quickly subside.Anxiety significantly reduces the quality of one’s life. You may be greatly helped by taking medication. Therapy could also be highly beneficial. I hope this eases some of your fears. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Iran: My fiancé has lied to me about the most basic of things. She said she studied in the United States for her masters, and as a trusting soul I believed her. I never once asked questions regarding her past and the fact that she had studied in India before that made me think it quite probable. Then came where she lived, she said she lived in a middle class area and then I found out this was not the case, I am not a snob and do not care whether or not she and her family had money or not. But finding these things out I am starting to think she was a liar, when I questioned her about it she started crying and made me feel awful. Then she said she was 28, well me being 27 I believed her why not she doesn’t look old, then I found out she was 29, then the next day she came over and told me she was 32. At this point I have no idea what to believe and feeling why would she lie in such a way. [/INST]  It sounds to me like your fiance doesn’t believe that she is good enough as she is. You may not be a snob but she sounds very insecure. None of her lies are harmful. She isn’t stealing or cheating or manipulating you to do things you would find shameful. She is making herself seem just a bit more educated, a little younger, and with a background that is a little more successful in order to be worthy of someone like you.What she doesn’t seem to understand is that you love her just as she is and that these adjustments of her story make you question whether there are other, more serious things she isn’t telling you. Her efforts to make herself more acceptable to you are now doing just the opposite. She is chipping away at your trust in what she says.If you love this woman, then compassion, not anger is the solution. Angry confrontations about her “lies” won’t solve the problem. What she needs instead is to be reassured that you love her just the way she is. I hope she has enough self-esteem to be able to take that in and accept your love.I wish you well.  </s>"

The “incest taboo” exists to protect young people and their older relatives from making a psychologically dangerous mistake for them both. For some men, living with an attractive young woman, especially a young woman who is not biologically related to them, is very challenging. Their sense goes out the window when their body responds to the attraction. Some stepdads and even some dads distance themselves from their teenaged daughters because it’s the only way they know to keep the girl and themselves safe. When that happens, it’s often very confusing to a girl who has been daddy’s little girl to have her father start to act cold and aloof. It’s a sad solution for them both.To your stepdad’s credit, he stopped when you told him to and apologized without prompting from someone else. It sounds like he fully understands that what he did was wrong. He did not make excuses. He did not swear you to secrecy. He is appropriately ashamed of himself. I’m not saying that this makes what he did okay. It’s not. But it does sound like you can repair the relationship if you want to. Up until now he’s been a good dad to you so it’s maybe worth a try.I do think you should tell your stepdad that he needs to tell your mother what he did. Then the three of you need to have a discussion about how to live together safely. If he is truly ashamed of himself and asks for forgiveness, you – and your mother – could decide to give him a chance. Only the two of you know if he has enough good qualities to balance out a serious slip in judgment.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I used to stay at my now ex-boyfriend dorm, during one of those nights we had sex and had fallen asleep undressed (I was aware of what we had done). The next morning I woke up and there was a condom wrapper next to me; I was confused because I didn’t recall doing anything else with him after falling asleep. I asked him about it and he told me if I didn’t remember that we had done it again after that; he just said he thought I was awake because he heard me moan. But I don’t remember a thing; further on I got really bad anxiety with him, it can be described as a fear of him. [/INST]  There are federal and state legal definitions of rape. Generally speaking, rape involves non-consenting sexual behavior. If you didn’t agree to it or know about it because you were asleep, (i.e. did not consent) it would generally be considered a crime. However, whether or not he is guilty of rape is a legal question that I cannot answer. Those types of questions should be directed towards legal and or law enforcement professionals.You mentioned that he is now your ex-boyfriend. Part of the reason seems to involve your fear of him. If he had sex with you while you were unconscious, then your fear of him is warranted.Because this incident happened on school grounds, you should contact on-site counselors. Under federal law, schools are required to respond to reports of sexual violence. Under Title IX, of the 1972 educational amendments, colleges and universities who receive federal funding are required to “combat gender-based violence and harassment, and respond to survivors needs in order to ensure that all students have equal access to education.” Most higher education academic institutions have resources on campus to help victims of sexual violence. The school counselors will know how to help you. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve always been a very optimistic person…looking forward to all aspects of life and not taking anything for granted.  Recently, I moved away from home.  I am an only child and my parents have been having a difficult time getting along with me not being constantly around.  I do have a personal relationship at home so I come back frequently to visit my significant other and my parents.  My mother has always been the emotional type.  She cried often; even when I was younger.  However, recently her crying spurts have become unbearable.  She has some health issues and can’t get around as well as she used to.  She hates her job and on top of it, my dad hasn’t been incredibly supportive.  She also let the house go and now clutter is everywhere.  If she’s home, she sleeps most of the day, making my father more aggravated.  Then she cries if we ask her about it.  She came to visit me at my new house and cried randomly most of the time, even in front of my roommates.  She told me how she hates her life and how she’s going through a “mid-life crisis.”  She said she has no one to talk to because her mother is gone and she never had any sisters.  I felt bad because all I could think was how I don’t have any siblings to talk to and my mother, who is still with me, can’t spend time with me without crying.  It’s wearing on me.  I can’t take her to any event without her getting incredibly emotional.  I don’t want to be insensitive, but it’s starting to become embarrassing.  I’m getting to the point in life where major, wonderful events are going to take place like marriage, children, purchasing property, etc… and I want my mother there.  I have no one else, I need her there as a supportive figure and now I don’t know what to do.  I don’t know how to help her and now it’s putting me into a funk also.  I can’t talk to my dad because he isn’t an emotional individual and has other, current issues going on with his side of the family.  What do I do?  I told her maybe she needs to talk to someone and she won’t hear any sort of it.  She thinks she’s fine.  I can’t go on with this. (age 25, from US) [/INST]  I’m sorry that you have found yourself in this difficult situation. Small families can be wonderfully close and intimate, but sometimes that can feel suffocating as well. It sounds like your mother is experiencing depression, though she may be in denial, but you cannot fix it for her. What you can do is be relentless about suggesting that she get some professional help outside of the family. If she tells you that she is fine, confront her with what you have described here, that’s it’s not normal to cry so much and sleep her time away.If you really want to go all out you could make an appointment with a therapist yourself in your home town and request family therapy. If you (and maybe even your father) go with her, it may seem less frightening and she may be more likely to continue on her own. You can also encourage her to speak with her doctor about what she is referring to as a “mid-life crisis.” She may have enough trust in her doctor to get a therapy referral from them, or to try medication.But, no matter how much you try to help your mom, you have to go on with your life and she needs to find ways to fill the gaps in her own.  She is an adult, and so are you. I know you said that you can’t speak to your father about it, but I disagree. He may have other issues going on but he is her spouse and thus should also be her number one support. At a minimum, let him know you are concerned.All the best, </s>"

Mainly because in my odd day 4th period class there is always this kid who makes fun of me, and he always tries to point out my flaws. I tried saying something to the teacher, because he was talking to me about it but he just made the situation even worse. It’s hard ignoring him when he is saying you look like a man,you have a huge forehead, you’re ugly,etc. The thing is nobody else I’ve met point any of that out. [/INST]  I’m so, so sorry that you are having to deal with this on a daily basis. You should absolutely not have to sit next to this guy and put up with his comments. No one, no matter how shy, should be subjected to such constant abuse.I’m glad you tried to reach out to the teacher and principal. I’m astounded that they didn’t change your class or at least your seat. I’m even more astounded that this kid is allowed to continue making life hard for others.What you do now is get off the Internet and talk to your parents. Withdrawing into the “net” isn’t going to stop the bullying. Withdrawing from other people by staying in your room isn’t going to help you get over being shy. Tell your parents what you’ve told me and ask them to intervene. You’ve done all that can be expected of a teen. Now it’s their turn to do what parents are supposed to do — protect you. They can insist that something be done.If shyness continues to be an issue, please consider getting some counseling to help you learn new skills for expressing yourself and being more social.

"<s>[INST] From a teen in Australia: I overthink everything…Let’s say, my parents, are supposed to pick me up from school. I patiently wait for them for a while but the more I start seeing everyone else going home the more stressed and panicked I get. I immediately think of the worst case scenario…It can get from “Oh they are just late”; to “What if they got in bad a car accident?” or “If I call them now they might get distracted while driving and it will be my fault, maybe they are in trouble.” [/INST] Yes, it makes sense. It sounds to me like you are a very lonely girl. Starting at a new school is tough at any age but it’s especially difficult in the teen years. Often the kids at school have already pretty much established their friend group. It’s difficult to break in if you are just an ordinary kid. Kids who are star athletes or have amazingly outgoing personalities do have it a bit easier but even they tell me that they feel out of place for quite a while.One of the best ways to become part of the social world of a new school is to join some club or sport. Working side by side towards a goal with people who have similar interests lets people get to know each other naturally. If you haven’t done that already, I hope you will take a new look at what your school has to offer for extra curricular activities. If nothing there suits you, take a new look around in your community for a project or cause where other teens volunteer.Unfortunately, you moved before you had time to figure out how to repair the friendship in the other school. Learning how to manage it when friends don’t get along is part of the challenge of the teen years. I hope you can think about what happened and learn from it. It’s often useful to think about what might have been your part in the problem. That’s the part you can fix. We can’t make other people do something differently but we do have the power to change ourselves.You also shared that you have a sister with autism. I really, really want you to know that you are not alone in your efforts not to give your folks someone else to worry about. Most kids who have a sibling who is in any way disabled or chonically ill do the same thing. You get kind of caught between two ideas: You wish your folks had more time for you. And you understand that they are doing the best they can. Often the parents are exhausted from taking care of the kid who has special needs.  Sensitive kids like you pick up on their limited energy.  Of course you feel vulnerable. Your whole family is feeling emotionally tired.One way to handle that is to ask your parents if they can each give you a little time without your sister each week. It’s okay to need some undivided attention. If you make a regular “date” with each parent, it will make things a  bit easier. You will have some time you can count on. They will feel less torn between you and your sister all the time if they know they have a special time reserved just for you. It’s worth a try.You and your parents might find it helpful to take a look at this article.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a young woman in Egypt: The first person I ever loved was my boyfriend of a few months. It was toxic and abusive. He was suicidal and so was I at the time, he would self harm with me on the phone with him and hang up sometimes saying “goodbye, good bye”; as in “I’m leaving”. I would stay up all night. [/INST] Thank you so much for writing. I’m sure it was painful to think about your problems with the first boyfriend. Although your time with him was not healthy, it was very, very intense. The two of you were in a mutually destructive cycle of self abuse and mutual neediness and reassurance and more self abuse. I’ve found that the intensity of this kind of situation is both terrifying and addictive. It makes sense to me that you are afraid of getting back into such a cycle again.Before you can trust other people, I think you have some healing to do so you can trust yourself not to get caught up in such a destructive relationship again. If you could do that on your own, you would have done it already. For that reason, I do strongly urge you to see a counselor to help you recover from a traumatizing relationship and to help you start trusting yourself again.If therapy isn’t available in your city, a place to start is one of the forums here at PsychCentral. People from all over the world give each other advice and important support.I wish you well.  </s>"
<s>[INST] From the U.S.: Hi there! I appreciate this resource and the ability to seek some professional advise. I am needing relationship advise in regards to a guy that I have been dating (long distance relationship) for a year now and we are looking to get married. I find him to be a great guy and we complement each other well. [/INST]  I’m glad you are thinking carefully about this. Your fiance has been very honest with you about his commitment to his mother’s care. Marriage to him means joining him in that commitment. He is not going to change it.The person you need to be talking to about these issues is your future husband. You say you plan on having children. Does he? How will the two of you handle the expense involved in supporting both his mom and your own growing family? What are his expectations regarding your financial contribution to the family? Do you agree? What are his expectations for your role in his mother’s care? Do you agree?I don’t think you should go ahead with this relationship unless and until you have the answers to those questions. An honest conversation with your fiance will give you the answer you need about whether to go ahead.I wish you well.  </s>
"<s>[INST] I’m 19 and have been experiencing strange emotions this past year. The deep connections I felt with friends are suddenly forced and it is almost painful to be around people. I have also had strange spells of depersonalization. My ex boyfriend died a couple years ago which led me into a spell of depression and I don’t know if I ever made it out or if I’m just used to it. I’m constantly annoyed and tired and prefer to be alone most of the time. Yet I told my best friend what has been going on and she had no clue, she said I’ve been normal but maybe a bit distant, but the differences I see/feel are blaring. I also have short bursts of rage for really no reason. My relationships are what really make me question my growing issues. To sum it up, I go for the guys who can’t be tied down and have emotional issues usually sociopathic tendencies, I hate it but no one else interests me. This is what concerns me most, I don’t think I really have feelings. I feel like I just talk myself into being “in love” with them just to prove that I could get them. In the end, all I really want to do is win them. I don’t miss them when we break up, I just can’t fathom the thought of someone else taking my spot. I go insane with texting and calling when something goes wrong and can’t control myself. I show up at their house unannounced and the next day think “was that even me, I’d never do that”. I also feel like I can’t emotionally connect with anyone and I think it’s because they sense some thing is off about me. I constantly want to fight with them and pull them back when I think they are going to leave, I am always the one who gets left but it’s almost like I ask for it. If I even date someone I feel like it’s always going to end in them prying me off of them or either marriage. I get so into one person that no matter what I will try to make it work but ruin it as well. I’ve gone to a therapist but couldn’t say this all I just said I had anxiety. Please tell me what this could be or what I should do. [/INST]  Thank you for being so brave to explain all the statistical reactions. I admire your honesty. I think it may be two things that are happening simultaneously.I would begin by looking at the unfinished grief from your boyfriend’s death. I think working through that in therapy would be good. Additionally, the fact that you preselect partners that can’t commit and then wobble back-and-forth when the relationship fails suggests that you may want to explore this pattern of attachment in therapy as well. While I believe grieving plays a big part I think this other dynamic maybe be very important in understanding why you feel the way you do. I would encourage you to bring these two points: the unresolved grief and your attachment process into therapy. Since your profile showed you are at a university means you have access through the counseling center to highly qualified counselors. They are usually very proficient in helping people sort through these types of issues, and I think talking to them about this will help.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My boyfriend and I have been dating for 6 years. I currently live abroad going to medical school and he lives in Houston, we have been the long distance for 3 years. My parents have always been overprotective and don’t agree with our relationship and this has bothered my boyfriend this whole time but I always tells him it’s gonna get fixed. This summer he was very upset I was with my family the whole time and didn’t dedicate time to him. I agreed and said I was sorry. Well he had a female friend coworker that he liked to talked to. I had told him that she liked him but he denied it, of course. Anyways, she is married and has a kid. Well, I go visit him and he seemed strange, she kept texting him and I told him that needed to stop, I asked him did anything happen between you two and he responded yes, I couldn’t hide it from you. I made him tell me how many times and he said 4. I asked him why and he said he doesn’t know, he said he was super frustrated and upset at our situation and he enjoyed talking to her. But he said he was really really sorry and that he loves me, he chooses me and he is willing to do whatever it takes to make me happy. I didn’t deserve what he did to me and he is very very sorry. So he stopped talking to her but I still have this distrust and anxiety attacks as to why did this happen. I feel like I could have prevented it somehow. I decided to forgive him but it still hurts. What can I do? I really want our relationship to work but don’t know how to heal this wound in my heart. I see myself married to him, but how can he help me trust him again. I need help :( Thank you. [/INST]  This is a tough one. The fact that you live so far apart and there is no opportunity for couples therapy right now makes the issue very difficult because of the feelings you’ve described.I think for the moment what I would do is set up a couples therapy weekend where the two of you could work with other couples and a trained therapist to learn more about managing your long-distance love. Here is a link to one of the better-known programs.Long-distance relationships can work, but they take some genuine attention to mutual appreciation for each other. Here’s a recent article I’ve written about this topic.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I was diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety as a teenager, dealing with cutting and bulimia. As the years have gone by, I’ve been on and off of medications and while I knew I still dealt with the mental illness, I felt like I’d grown a lot. Over the last couple of years, though, things have gotten bad again. It seems that I’ll be fine or at least stable for months until something will go wrong, and it’s like a house of cards toppling over. It’ll send me spiraling into what I refer to as an episode for lack of a better word. I’ve described episodes before to my previous nurse practitioner/psychologists, but it never occurred to me until recently that I should’ve told them about the voice I would hear during the episodes. I’ve always just thought of it as my own thoughts, except way louder and more aggressive, but after reading about the difference between your own voice in your head and hearing a voice, I’m now more concerned about the episodes. The last time I had one, I ended up grabbing a bottle of pills, stealing a knife from my sister’s house, sending my mom a goodbye text, and walking the streets in 20 degree weather while cutting myself and all at the urging of what I thought to be my own thoughts. However, looking back on it, I can still hear the voice berating me, referring to me in the third person instead of first. My thinking is completely distorted during these episodes, and as soon as I come out of it (usually within a few hours), I’m embarrassed by my actions and think clearly again. For example, one time I was so anxious that no one would pick me to do a group project with them in class, that I went home and started cutting so my mom would have to take me to the hospital and I’d get to miss school the day they chose partners. Is that delusional thinking? I’ve never met someone with depression/anxiety who has episodes that intense and rapid. It’s like feeling the craziness of mania, but without the happiness/confidence. Is there a such thing as having depression with psychotic episodes or is that normal and I’m just thinking too deep into it or being a hypochondriac? [/INST] Unfortunately, it’s impossible to give a diagnosis via the internet. Your treatment team would be in the best position to answer your questions. I would encourage you to have this discussion with them.It’s also important to remember that diagnosing is not an exact science. It’s common for diagnoses to change over time and to differ based upon the practitioner.The voice you described is indeed worthy of exploration. In your view, it’s not your voice. It’s not clear to me whether it’s indicative of psychosis or simply a highly critical element of your personality.In the examples provided, you responded to the stressful situations with self-harm. No matter the diagnosis, more healthy coping skills are needed.You might ask your treating professionals about dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT). It’s an especially effective treatment for the symptoms you have described. It’s designed for assisting individuals in regulating their emotions, developing healthy coping skills, and in the treatment of suicidal and other to self-destructive behaviors. Though DBT was originally designed for individuals with borderline personality disorder, many therapists have successfully utilized its’ treatment components for other disorders. I hope this helps. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My issue is that a couple of months ago i realized that my mom was texting more than usual and when i would go see who she was texting she would move the phone out of my field of view so that made me even more curious, then a couple of days later i borrowed her computer to do school work and found a picture of a guy in a hotel room in his underwear that she took. [/INST]  Although I can understand why it feels easier to direct your anger at the guy, the person you need to be talking to is your mother. She has put you in a terribly awkward position by behaving in ways that drew your attention and by leaving a “trail” so she would be found out. It makes me wonder if she is unconsciously hoping someone will figure this out and help her put the brakes on.I realize it’s hard for a young man to call his mother out on something like this but I think you already know you can’t hold this secret. If you can’t bring yourself to talk to her directly, why not simply hand her a copy of the letter you sent to me? Then tell her how unfair it is to put you in the middle when you love both her and your dad. Be clear that you can’t be asked to keep her secret when doing so would damage your relationship with your father. Don’t threaten to tell your dad everything you know. It’s enough to tell him that he and your mom have some things to talk about. Suggest they get some counseling and then leave it to them. Yes, the relationship between your parents affects you. But how they handle their troubles has to be between them.No matter how old they are, it’s hard on kids when their parents’ relationship is unstable. It’s especially hard when there has been no reason to think that there is tension between them. I’m sorry you are being pulled through this. Do remember that the situation is probably more complicated than you think and that you don’t have to take sides. You can love them both.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in Romania: I feel like there may be a problem with me overall since I never had girlfriend and my friends are pretty cold with me. [/INST]  The teen years can be very rough on people. Often what kids think is abnormal is not. For example: It is not at all unusual for someone your age not to have a girlfriend. In fact, only about half of people have a significant romantic relationship before age 20. The other half find first love during the next 5 years. So keep doing what you are doing. Make friends. Refine your social skills and enjoy hanging out with the people you hang out with.Secondly, lots of teens are afraid of rejection so they don’t do much inviting. They do respond, though, when someone else makes the first move. It seems that you have more courage than some of your friends. You do make the calls. My suggestion to you is that you relax and enjoy the fact that they respond.It’s the so-called “weird kids” who often are the most successful in adult life. You are an individual. You don’t just follow the herd. You are doing normal things and feel just as normally abnormal as most teens do. I don’t see anything in your letter that raises alarms for me.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My partner of many years had a childhood of abuse and abandonment. Eventually he was adopted and things improved to a degree. He’s never really dealt with his emotions about his past, although he is a sensitive guy and I know he has a lot of hurt inside him. He has instead chosen to repress and ignore these emotions. He moved across country, so his family is out of sight, out of mind. He will do anything to distract himself and not think about it. He definitely has shown signs of depression on and off over the years. I’ve suggested therapy to him before. It comes up perhaps once a year. He is extremely reluctant and he says has no desire to relive his terrible past. I’ve told him I understand that and that I think while therapy would be painful, I believe it would be worth it in the end. He’s extremely stubborn and pushing an issue will make him more likely to reject it, so I don’t bring this up often. My approach is to discuss it in a supportive manner, encourage help, not push it, leave it to germinate. It seems to have made him open up to the possibility of help. He has conceded in the past year that he might be depressed. We recently visited his adoptive parents. It had been 3-4 years since he had seen them, because they live back “home” and he’s been avoiding his past entirely. His foster father is very old and unwell. He put off seeing them as long as he could. I encouraged him to go visit, because the guilt at not going was evident and I knew he would have terrible regrets if his foster father died and he had not gone to see him in so long. I know he feels a lot of guilt for being so far from them, especially now they are old and unwell. He approached me today and stated he thinks he is depressed. I think this is a huge step for him to admit this. I want him to get the help he needs. I will of course, be supportive and will listen to anything he wants to talk about. I do strongly believe that therapy would be invaluable to him. How do I encourage this route without scaring him back into his shell? Thank you. [/INST]  You gently encouraged him to seek treatment and then backed off when you felt that he was at his limit. You were supportive and encouraging but not pushy. You “stood your ground” but realized when to back off. You seem to be doing all of the right things.More recently, he confided in you about his depression. This suggests that he sees you as trustworthy and nonthreatening. It is further proof that your approach is correct.You should continue doing what you are doing. You can’t force someone to go to treatment. People are ready when they are ready and no sooner (and some people unfortunately are never ready).However, he seems to be indicating that he might be open to treatment. Continue to be patient, supportive and encouraging. Hopefully, he will realize the wisdom of your advice. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I was married for 20+ years (I’m 48) and have 2 teen aged children, one at home and one at university. My marriage is over, I am separated, and I am ready to move on. I am still good friends with my ex and we are supportive of each other. 2 years ago I met a man in a very similar situation. He was separated a year before me, and has two children also the same ages as mine. We hit it off immediately, and fell in love. We love each other very much. In the early days of our relationship I told him that one of my goals was to have one more serious relationship in my life and to be living together with that man. He said that he would like that too, one day. [/INST]  You’re right. He isn’t moving forward. By keeping the two families separate, he is preventing the “blending” that happens when people with children move from “dating” to making a new kind of family.You and your ex have moved past your hurt and anger and have an amicable relationship. When this can happen, it’s best for everyone. The children aren’t conflicted about spending time with either parent. The parents aren’t still living in old pain. This is what it means to move on. Three years after the breakup, your boyfriend isn’t on speaking terms with his ex’s partner. It appears he was so hurt by the breakup of his marriage that he can’t take the risk to start again.That’s sad. Your relationship sounds like it has promise. All you can do is try to talk to him about it. In a way, he is letting his “controlling” ex still control how he lives his life. His reaction to her behavior is holding him back.He might find it useful to talk to a therapist to help him resolve his feelings about his prior marriage and divorce. Another route to go would be for the two of you to see a couples therapist – together – to help you find ways to reassure him and to help him trust you and your relationship as being different from him first marriage.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] So my parents have 50/50 custody, the past year i was kicked out living my aunt because my parents didn’t want to deal with me . Anyways now i want to live with my dad but my mom wants me to live with her. 1. I do not get along with my mom, there’s never a moment where we do not fight and she lives in a tiny one-bedroom apartment and i would have to sleep on the floor. At my dad’s , i want to live there but my stepmom is telling my dad i can’t ?? I have a room there and everything, she says because she doesn’t trust me and she doesn’t feel safe around me when she’s literally thrown stuff at my head, called the cops on me and everything. Living with my dad may be sucky but it’s a hell of a lot better than sleeping on the floor. What do i do if my dad refuses to let me live with him even though i’m still a minor. [/INST] Because they are sharing custody, they most likely have a legal agreement that was made in court and sanctioned by a judge. Therefore, this issue is something that will likely need to be dealt with in a court setting.In custody proceedings, particularly in those that are contentious, children are often represented by individuals known as a guardian ad litem. These individuals may be social workers or other mental health professionals who are appointed by the court to represent children who are not of legal age and legally not considered able to make decisions for themselves. In California, you need to be 18 in order to make legal decisions for yourself (and that is likely true in most other states). The job of the guardian ad litem is to represent the interests of the child during legal proceedings. Their goal is to ensure the child’s best interest.You might want to ask your aunt to assist you in requesting a guardian ad litem from the court or do this yourself, if you know how. You might be able to contact the judge or one of your parents’ attorneys in order to make the request.Your request would likely prompt a court hearing to assess your living situation. This would serve as a good opportunity for you to make your case for living with your father. It may also assist you in getting extra support both psychologically and financially. You mentioned that your mother lives in a tiny apartment. The guardian ad litem may be able to advocate for additional resources to better accommodate your living situation.Another request to consider is family therapy. Specifically, this could assist you, your father, and your stepmother in resolving some of the issues you have described. Family therapy is often useful in situations involving stepfamilies. It’s not uncommon for there to be strains on relationships with blended families. Family therapy could be the ideal solution to this problem.If you have the option of therapy, request a therapist that specifically has training in stepfamily dynamics. A skilled therapist can help to resolve some of these issues and make living together much easier.Another consideration is the possibility that it may be in your best interest to continue living with your aunt. You mentioned that you would prefer living with your father, but it may not be the ideal situation for you especially if your stepmother doesn’t want you living there. Ideally, you want to be living where you are welcome. You didn’t mention much about your aunt and why you no longer want to live with her. Maybe it’s just your preference, but you may want to consider her as an option.In the meantime, you’re going to be turning 18 very soon and graduating high school. This marks a new chapter in your life. If possible, it may be best to get a job and start saving your money, so you can eventually live more independently. Counseling and related services could assist you in transitioning into a more independent living situation. Utilize the services that may be available to you through the court. The more assistance you have, the easier it will be to live independent of your family. Clearly, they are struggling with their own issues and thus learning to survive on your own will be important.I hope this answer provides you some insight into how to move forward with your issue. Don’t hesitate to write again if you have additional questions or wish to provide additional information. The information I have about your personal life and situation helps me to help you. The more the better. Good luck with your efforts. Thanks for writing. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I am a 14 year old, I barely have any friends only one I’m remotely close to. Mostly I make online friends and for some reason I get intense fear and anxiety when one of them gets angry at me or something I say doesn’t settle well with them. I’d go far as to start bawling and self-harm till I bleed a little before I feel less guilty, like a self-punishment of some sort. [/INST]  I don’t think you are being overly sensitive. You had a tough beginning. You had to leave your parents at age 2 and then leave the relatives at age 4. As a result, it could be that you developed a distrust of attaching to anyone. On top of that, your mother has had a hard time and hasn’t always been warm or supportive. Hitting and slapping is not a way to make a child feel safe. It’s simply not okay.It makes sense that you are cautious about getting close but it is definitely something to work on. Not everyone you befriend or love is going to leave you. In fact, acting like someone will leave might make them do just that. We do tend to get what we expect.If you can’t let yourself develop close relationships, I do suggest that you make an appointment with a mental health counselor who can help you both understand yourself better and can guide you as you work on being more comfortable in close relationships.I’m very glad you wrote now, when you are 14, instead of waiting. Waiting on issues like this one tends to make it more difficult to fix. Getting into some therapy now will help you have a much happier social life in school and will set you on a more positive course for relationships in your future.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am a young male who feels depressed at the age of twenty I should be happy where I’m at. I live with three good friends who I grew up with I work at a ridiculously well respected dealership in a small city, I’m single. The ideal situation for a male my age, but I am feeling grounded my job is a emotional roller coaster that is aided by bitter co workers who put you down at every opportunity and make sure I know I’m “the new kid.” (note my closest aged co worker is 25 years my senior) I sleep more often now and often Haft to fight myself to get out of bed in the morning. I feel guilty for things that are not bad. I often turn to drinking to calm my pain. My real confidant passed two years ago when I was 17 and now I have no one to really talk about my troubles with I feel just sad constantly and seem to only be my old self (happy charismatic energetic) once I’m drunk and even then I feel this cloud hovering over me. I constantly ask my self what ski doing? Why am I here? What is the point? And of course is it worth it to even leave the house? It’s just so hard at this point in my life to smile. this isn’t a cry for pity but a request for help I need to smile again I need to find a new road to happiness how can I do that? [/INST]  Based on the symptoms that you described, you may be experiencing depression. I can’t know that with certainty but it seems like a realistic possibility.Further evidence of possible depression is the fact that you have resorted to drinking as a way to deal with your psychological pain. People often turn to drinking as a way to emotionally numb themselves. In clinical terms, individuals who utilize drugs or alcohol to numb their emotional pain are “self-medicating.”In every case, drinking makes a situation worse, especially among those with depression. Alcohol, chemically speaking, is a nervous system depressant. That means it could be contributing to your depressed mood. The fact that you have begun self-medicating with alcohol may mean that this problem is becoming worse.It is also concerning that you seem to feel as though your life has no purpose. That is evidenced by some of the questions you’ve been asking yourself such as “why am I here?” or “what is the point?” Such questions may also be indicative of an individual who is contemplating suicide. You expressed no definitive suicidal ideation but it is a concern in all cases of depression.You should consider counseling. Medication might also assist with your depressed mood. Mental health professionals deal with these types of problems on a regular basis. Utilize their expertise to improve your life. I hope you will consider professional help. It could help you immensely. You might be very surprised by how quickly and easily a therapist could help with your problem. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My boyfriend (61yrs. old-like me) keeps in touch with some of his ex-girlfriends (he never married) on Facebook and even though I’m on too, his girlfriends don’t know he has a girlfriend–they (some are married) make references about old times, how handsome he sill is, etc.–then he always “likes” these comments!–they private message him too! Even though he tells me, I get upset that they don’t know about me–I have no problem that he stays in touch-just acknowledge me. Some have even asked him out for drinks! He knows this hurts me, but he claims he loves me, he’s with me, I should trust him and it’s no big deal–he doesn’t follow up on their requests(although he messaged one “sounds good, I’ll call you”-which I accidentally saw when I was on his computer with him at his place)- I was very upset why he didn’t say “can my girlfriend come?”- I’m not in touch with anyone from my past and there’s nobody in his face to make him insecure/nervous; and if I were, they would surely know about him. How can I get past this/what more can I do? This makes me insecure and my trust level low, because I’ve had many past relationships when I didn’t know my boyfriends had girlfriends/ fiancés-I was the hidden one; and 2 marriages with both husbands who cheated (he knows this!) Everything else with him is fantastic–other than this “elephant in the room”. [/INST]  It’s important not to minimize that your boyfriend is ignoring your discomfort. If he’s not willing to say he’s in a committed relationship with you, then he isn’t. I would be clear with him that you don’t want to be kept a secret and that it’s troublesome for you to see this contact with other women where you are not acknowledged. If he’s unwilling to make your relationship known, then you have a decision to make. It is either a deal-breaker or you stay in the relationship but let him know that you plan to have the same right and freedom as him: Namely, to have contact with male friends and not inform them that you are in a relationship.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From New Zealand: I’m a 12 year old girl and i have been traumatized throughout my childhood up until i was about 8 years old. I’ve been going to counselling since i was 10 and everybody i see (including my own family) have told me that i have been traumatized even though i don’t feel traumatized at all. [/INST]  I’m so very sorry that you’ve been through so much and that you continue to be in major distress. It may be that you don’t feel traumatized because you are psychologically protecting yourself from having the feelings. That’s what the people who are helping you mean when they tell you that your memories (and probably the feelings that went with them) are in your subconscious. Your visits to imaginary worlds and your imaginary friends are likely another way your system is protecting you.Although losing time as you do and feeling like there are others in your head who talk to you or who make you do things are symptoms of Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), I don’t have enough information to make a diagnosis. I trust that the mental health professionals who know you well can answer your question. Even more importantly, they can help you recover from trauma and become the girl you are meant to be.I’m glad you are in treatment. You know that your “episodes” and your impulses to kill your mum or yourself aren’t normal. You know you need help to feel in charge of yourself. Your letter shows me that you are intelligent, curious and sensitive. Those are important ingredients for success in treatment.I urge you to be an active member of your treatment team. Your therapists depend on you to be as honest as you can with them and to share all of your thoughts and feelings — even when they don’t make much sense to you; especially when they don’t make sense to you. Therapists can’t read your mind or your heart so your reports are a key part of your treatment. With time and work, you and your team can get you back on track to be a normal teen with just normal teen prolems.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I was have been diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety disorder. I have this voice in my head that talks to me and tells me what to do. Sometimes it says things like “if you don’t go do this you’ll die” other times it tells me to cut or to kill myself. It tells me I’m worthless and a failure. I also spend a lot of my time talking to myself and the voice in my head. It’s not an external voice, I’m not hearing it, I know it’s in my head. I asked my psychology teacher and she said that may be schizophrenia. I am afraid to ask anyone else because people think I’m crazy. I also don’t have the social skills to even approach anybody. I believe I may have Asperger’s syndrome as well because I have absolutely no social skills whatsoever and people think I’m rude because of it and my girlfriend has pointed out that I have these weird obsessions. Do you have any advice for me?  [/INST] A: Yes, I have some advice for you … go get some professional help.  Either go back to the person who diagnosed you with ADHD and an anxiety disorder or ask your parents to take you to someone else. Hearing voices, especially ones that tell you to do things, is not normal and is not typically part of the diagnoses you list here.   Auditory hallucinations can be linked to several things, including schizophrenia, severe depression, bipolar disorder and some types of dissociative disorders. There are also some medical conditions that can cause hallucinations. Getting an accurate diagnosis from a mental health professional now, while you are still young, could be crucial in avoiding more severe problems later. Furthermore, you don’t have to have good social skills to participate in therapy. In fact, therapy can help you improve your social skills, which will help you interact more effectively in your personal relationships. Don’t worry about being “crazy” or about what anyone thinks. No one besides you and your parents need to know about  your treatment, but please talk to your parents soon about getting professional help. You can also talk with your school counselor or nurse, or your family physician, to get an appropriate referral. I hope things get better for you soon.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] It began in middle school after we moved and I put on maybe 5 lb. For the next couple months my weight became the butt of everyone’s jokes, I was 11- 5″1″ and barely 100 lbs. The constant teasing made me hate myself and I began cutting. When they found out I was immediately grounded, no phone, no hangouts, school only. I began getting sick the next year (anemia) my mom refused to take me to the doctor for a whole year and told me that if I ate steak then it wouldn’t even be a problem. My doctors said that I needed a blood transfusion, my mom refused so instead I had to quit sports, fail my classes, and I was so weak I couldn’t walk up the stairs without help. When I realized I was failing I begged her for a tutor and she refused until it was too late. I’m really self conscious about my scars (I have a rare skin disease too) and she forced me to wear a bathing suit and I started crying and she told me I need to learn to get over it because she had it worse. (From Japan) [/INST]  Your mother isn’t giving you adequate treatment and is making medical decisions about your well-being that have hurt you. It is time to take matters into you own hands and stop relying on your mother to make ill-informed, humiliating, and harmful choices about your care.It is time to get someone else involved. If you have an older sibling, or an aunt or uncle, or a teacher at school talk to them about the need for medical and psychological help. You may also want to talk to the physician that diagnosed your anemia and get him or her to help. The important thing is to take care of yourself and stop letting your mom make decisions that affect your psychological and physical health. It looks like you are near the end of high school and I would strongly recommend making plans to get out and away from your mother. Whether she is acting out of ignorance or malice she has made a series of decision that are hurtful and unhealthy for you.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am wondering if it’s possible that OCPD symptoms show up occasionally, like for example in situations that feel out of control or that fall out of the mental rigid scheme of the subject. Or is it just a less severe form of OCPD? [/INST] I would characterize the reactions in your examples as being disproportionate to the event described. Having a breakdown in response to being served the wrong pizza is inappropriate and not the norm. The proper response would have been reporting it to the waitstaff and requesting that the problem be corrected. There should have been no emotional response of the magnitude you have described. The situation simply does not necessitate a crisis-level emotional response.Problems happen in life. They are inevitable. They happen so often that we should expect them.If you are having “occasional episodes of crisis,” these should be analyzed in counseling. You may be lacking problem-solving skills. This type of issue is often easily correctable. Therapy can teach you to have more appropriate responses to all types of situations.You asked questions about a specific diagnosis. Those questions cannot be answered over the internet. Meeting with a counselor, in-person, is the best solution to this problem. Trained professionals can both answer your questions about a diagnosis and treat the problem. Mental rigidity is a common problem that can easily be remedied with counseling. I hope you will consider it. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m 21, and just starting college again. I have no job, and have been able to find one that I can handle. As a child and teenager, I had issues controlling myself when angry. There was never a diagnosis that completely explained it, but Manic-Depressive/Bipolar Disorder and Aspergers were suspected. I have trouble making friends, but not talking to people. I am unable to attempt to initiate a romantic relationship. I try my best to avoid conflict, but go as far as inconveniencing myself to avoid inconveniencing others. I’m not afraid of a fight as much as being afraid of bothering that person and having them think less of me. I don’t care what people think of me, but I do. I feel unaccepted, worthless, and often a burden on others, even when by myself. I am afraid of being used by people and am skeptical of anyone that shows a romantic interest in be, likely because it has happened in the past. [/INST]  Any time there is a concern about your mental health, it should be investigated to prevent the development of future problems. You are doing the right thing by asking for help.I have written about the “Truman-show” delusion in response to similar questions but to summarize, it is not an official mental health diagnosis. Its closest diagnostic classification might be delusional disorder, persecutory type. People with that disorder believe that someone is out to get them, someone is cheating them, someone is spying on them or otherwise mistreating them. The delusional belief centers on their being targeted and that certain events are not coincidental.You ended your letter by saying that you lack mental health insurance coverage but this should not preclude you from seeking treatment. Many communities offer free or sliding-scale services through community mental health centers. Call your local community mental health center to discuss your options. You can also contact your local health department for assistance. The staff can refer you to free or low-cost services.It may take some effort to determine if mental health services are available to you but it is very worthy of your time. When it comes to the potential development of a psychotic disorder, prevention and early treatment are of profound importance. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a young woman in Argentina: For a long time I’ve had issues with my parents. Our relationship has never been the best, and as I grew older it only worsened, to the point I’m questioning whether they are abusive or I’m overreacting. Taking therapy to fix our issues didn’t help, because my mom just thought my therapist was just putting me “against her”. [/INST]  I’m sorry the therapist wasn’t more deft in keeping your mother engaged in therapy. But it may be that nothing a therapist can say or do will help her feel like family work is needed or worthwhile. That being said, it’s time to stop blaming your mother for her overprotection and take charge of your own life. You can’t change your mom. You can change how you manage your life and how you interact with others.Social anxiety is difficult, but it is not impossible. A place to start helping yourself is at your local or school library. By studying there, you will minimize contact with your mom. By looking at books on anxiety disorders, you can develop a self-created treatment plan. You can also go to a book seller online and find a number of workbooks that provide step by step strategies for becoming more comfortable in the social world. Working through some of those workbooks is likely to be helpful.In addition, I encourage you to join one of the forums here at PsychCentral. You will meet people online who can give you practical help and support while you work on taking better care of yourself.Yes, healing will take work. But staying isolated in your fear isn’t going to help you make friends or get on with life. You are smart enough to be in college so I think you are smart enough to read and benefit from books and to successfully utilize online support.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have issues with many things, but right now I’m worried that I have an ID issue. I think I am going through Moratorium, but since I’ve been in foreclosure for a while- I feel very weird. Not to mention that I have literally modeled my entire personality after an idea of what I think a specific celebrity is like. I am scared. I dropped out to play guitar, but now I’m questioning everything that’s “me”. My career choice, gender identity, mannerisms, the stories and jokes I tell, the way I dress, my sense of humor- everything. I think I know why I modeled my entire life and self after this person- because all my role models growing up kind of sucked, I had a crush on this celebrity, and I felt like I was doing nothing and I really didn’t have a drive to do anything anyway. So when I was about 11-12, I started acting like them, and instantly I couldn’t stop. Now it’s just who I am. I’ve questioned it before but it scared me too much to think about, so I forgot about it. And I’m afraid that I’m obsessed with them, or that I might try to hurt them for some reason, or maybe that there’s not really a real “me”, or that I’m still that overweight, gross, depressed, talentless and ignored kid I was in grade school. I don’t know how to label this, but I don’t have access to any kind of help, and I’ve been travelling for years so any answer you give me will be welcome… [/INST]  The teenage years are difficult, much more so than many people realize. It’s rarely an easy transition. During this period of your life it’s normal to be asking the types of questions you are asking. It’s a time when you are attempting to become your own person and develop an identity separate from your family. According to Erikson, it often begins with identifying with a group or personality type. It’s not only normal but necessary.Dropping out of school likely exacerbated the difficulties associated with the transitional period of adolescence. You might consider returning to school. It may be difficult to succeed with a limited education. In the United States, most people who don’t graduate high school earn significantly less money than people who graduate high school. Put simply, there are fewer opportunities to be successful when you drop out of school. Fewer opportunities leads to more stress. Ideally, you want to put yourself in the best position to be successful.You said that you don’t have “any access … to help” and I’m wondering why? Maybe you don’t think you do but have you tried? I would highly recommend counseling. It would help you tremendously. It is the ideal solution to this problem. In the meantime, you might try utilizing online support groups, church-based counseling (which is often free), or reading self-help books. In person, counseling is the ideal and first-line treatment, but in its absence, the aforementioned ideas may be useful. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Australia: So I worked in an industry which is well known for boasting a “toxic” work environment for some 5 years. Throughout this time, I loved my job and was somewhat ignorant to the way that I was treated until it got pretty bad and I developed a career ending injury. For the 4th and 5th year of my career, I was not treated with respect, there was no sign of appreciation for all of those extra hours I put, or level of reliability despite illness and injury. My was not a nice person, and my manger became even worse to the point where I could no longer ask them questions as I knew the abuse would follow. [/INST] This is a very good question. I’m sure there are many people who can relate. Of course, any traumatizing situation can cause PTSD, but you would need the evaluation from a mental health counselor to determine if that is what is going on for you.It’s also possible that you are still recovering from a terrible work experience. There is a saying: “People don’t quit jobs, they quit bosses”. It points to the fact that even the most wonderful job in the world can become poisonous if the leader is divisive, unappreciative, disrespectful, and/or disorganized. You experienced the creeping effects of being mistreated over a period of time. It is not at all unusual for people to not understand what is happening for awhile. No one expects to be mistreated. Often the enthusiasm for the job blinds people to the negative interpersonal dynamics — at least at first.It makes sense to me that you are having trouble trusting that your new situation is any different, or at least different enough. It makes sense to me that you may be over-personalizing comments by your new boss. On the other hand, there may be red flags that your don’t trust yourself enough to heed. Of course you are anxious.Regardless of whether you meet the criteria for PTSD, you deserve some support and practical help for sorting through the past and for being realistically alert for a situation that isn’t healthy for you. For that reason, I think a few sessions with a mental health counselor or your Employee Assistance Program would be beneficial. I hope you will take yourself seriously and make an appointment soon.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My boyfriend and I dated for four months. After we first broke up, we started talking again. We talked for three months. Then I found out that the reason why he broke up with me was because he liked my sister. I was really hurt, but I still talked to him because I really, really cared about him. I could forgive him even if he liked my sister. [/INST]  Your jealousy toward your sister is certainly understandable given your ex-boyfriend’s attraction to her, but your intense jealousy is misplaced. Your ex is the one who hurt you, not your sister. I think you’re pushing your sister away to avoid getting hurt again, but it’s not going to work. Some guys will like you and others will like your sister. As long as you’re focused on keeping your sister away from all of your male friends you’ll stay stuck in the jealousy instead of learning how to move on in a healthy way after a relationship breakup.Feeling hurt and betrayed after a breakup is normal, and the fact that your boyfriend broke up with you via text doesn’t say much about his character.  When you feel the jealousy toward your sister coming up, identify it for what it is — hurt and fear. I think that the real question is why would you choose to get back together with a guy who told you he had feelings your sister? I recommend that you focus less on your sister and more on building your own feelings of self-worth so you can feel deserving of a relationship with someone who wants to be with you.Take good care of yourself.Julie Hanks, LCSW </s>"
"<s>[INST] There isn’t the day I don’t think about dying or just disappearing. I feel so tired of everything and every nigh I’m wishing I would fall asleep and never wake up. At some point I had this «happy thoughts» that kept me going but now I don’t even have that. I just live, day to day, like some kind of zombie. I’m trying so hard to get at least one positive thought so I could continue living, but nothing. I live because it’s something I’m expected to do. No matter how much it hurts to wake up every morning and LIVE, they wont let me die. I would be selfish for leaving them like this. But isn’t it selfish from them to make me live although this thing called life suffocates me? [/INST] Seven years clean and sober is something to celebrate. But the lack of addiction isn’t enough if life is lonely and miserable. Moving from negative mental health to neutral is an improvement, but it doesn’t make a happy life. Now you need help to move into the positive numbers.I’m very glad you are in treatment. I hope you are talking with your therapist about your loneliness. It is not at all uncommon for someone who was addicted so early in life and for so long to not have good social skills. You missed out on an important developmental stage when these skills get developed over time. Your therapist can help you begin to deal with what you missed and can support you while you try out what you learn.I suggest you talk to your therapist about adding group therapy to your treatment. In group, you will have the opportunity to learn and practice new ways to interact with other people. A therapist will ensure that feedback is both constructive and kind — but honest. (Group members generally provide more honest feedback than family or friends who worry about hurting your feelings or who just don’t know what to say.)As for getting socially involved: You aren’t ready to date yet. But you are way overdue for developing some friendships. The best way to do that is to join an activity you are truly interested in that also involves other people. Working on a project together puts the focus more on getting a job done than on developing friends. Ironically, it is often by working on a mutual project that friendships quite naturally develop. Consider projects such as Habitat for Humanity or a political campaign or a theater group — whatever truly interests you that will give you regular exposure to the same group. As you become more generally socially comfortable, you’ll be ready to date. You might even eventually find love while you are doing something worthwhile.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: My abuse all took place when I was a child. My adopted aunt I’m pretty sure has an intellectual disability. Nobody ever told me what it was. She always wanted to play dolls in her room to fuel her romantic and sexual fantasies. I only remember one night that she made me touch her, but I think my mind wiped out the actual act of doing it. So, I’m lead to wonder if it happened more times than that because I remember not being surprised and just hoping someone would catch her and save me. Nobody found out, to my knowledge. I would always tell my parents that I didn’t want to be isolated with her when we went to visit my grandparents because I wanted to spend time with them. I was always made to feel selfish for that and I think it developed some problem that I have lots of difficulty expressing my discomfort and talking about my mental issues. But, I can’t help but feel like I have no right to call myself a victim. [/INST] First things first: If you are concerned that your therapist will tell your parents what you talk about in therapy, your therapy will be severely handicapped. The therapeutic relationship is grounded in trust. Without trust, you can’t talk about the things that most concern you. Please talk directly with your therapist about your worries about whether she will keep your confidences. She will explain any limits on confidentiality so that you can relax into the work.As for the abuse: Abuse is abuse is abuse. Abuse affects the victim regardless of what motivates the abuser. Even when there are understandable reasons why a person with intellectual disability (ID) is sexually inappropriate, it doesn’t take away from the impact that behavior has on the victim.Understanding your aunt’s ID doesn’t get her “off the hook”. It identifies where she needs treatment. That really isn’t your problem. It is a problem for her helpers and her family to deal with. It’s not unusual for those close to a person with ID to be in denial about their sexually inappropriate behavior. They look at the person’s behavior through the filter of their disability and either dismiss it or make excuses for it. This doesn’t help either the person with ID or the victim. Now that you are older, perhaps you can talk to your parents about what really happened, its effect on you, and your aunt’s need for treatment.Please don’t blame yourself for not being more direct with your parents about what was going on. You are not at all alone in that response. You were a kid. What she was doing to you was confusing for you. Your parents’ reaction when you wanted to stay away from her probably made you feel that it wasn’t okay to talk about it or that you wouldn’t be believed.I’m very glad you are seeing a therapist. I hope you can finally talk about what happened and get the support and guidance you need and deserve to deal with it. I’m also very glad that you want to deal with this now, while you are still a teen. Untreated trauma can make it difficult to be in an intimate sexual relationship. Dealing with it now will help you leave the past where it belongs – in the past – so you can enjoy a relationship now and in the future.One of the many challenges in working with people with ID who have abused someone who is more vulnerable than they are is figuring out whether the person is a bonafide deviant or is acting out of ignorance.  David Hingburger and his colleagues outlined what they call “counterfeit deviance”, behaviors that look like sexual deviance but are in fact due to such things as lack of information, repressive environments, or lack of impulse control and social skills. I won’t go into detail here. If you are interested in learning more about sexually problematic behavior by people with ID, I suggest you look at this article: “Counterfeit Deviance Revisited.”I do remind you that whatever the motivation and difficulties of a person with ID, you are still entitled to your feelings of hurt, confusion, and even anger for your sense of betrayal by the adults who didn’t do something about it. That’s the work of your therapy. I hope you and your therapist can find a way to make your sessions feel safe enough for you to work on resolving any thoughts and feelings that are a result of the abuse.I wish you well, </s>"

He never says thank you when I make dinner, [/INST]  No, you shouldn’t break up the family over this — at least not yet. The most important thing you said in the letter is that your husband has changed in a major way. What you should do is insist that he get a complete medical workup.

"<s>[INST] Ok…so, I have had problems with self harm (cutting) for the past few years but have been clean for about 4 months now, which doesn’t seem like very long, at all. The triggers and urges have been really strong for the past few weeks and it has gotten to a point where I can remember how it use to feel, look, and everything about how it used to be. I have had a couple sort of ‘outer body’ type of experiences where I can picture myself sitting on the side of my bed cutting. I just really want to understand more of why I am feeling thins way and why. I asked my psych. teacher but he didn’t really give me what I was looking for, plus we got off on a tangent. I’d really appreciate it if you could help me out, thanks. [/INST]  Answering the “why” question can be difficult because each individual may engage in self-harm behavior for their own personal reasons. Generally, there are several reasons why individuals engage in self-harm. One reason may be that an individual feels as though they “deserve” to suffer. An individual who feels that way may fundamentally believe that they are unlovable or undeserving of love. They may also believe that they should be punished for a perceived wrongdoing.Individuals often engage in cutting behavior when they do not know how to handle their strong, negative emotions. Some individuals who cut report that the only time they feel emotional relief (although temporary) is when they cut. Others do it because they feel emotionally numb. For them, cutting provides emotional stimulation. Physical pain interrupts the emotional numbness. Thus, they can feel something even if it’s pain.Cutting is a sign that something is wrong and that someone is suffering. It can provide temporary relief but it’s always dangerous and ineffective.At this point, you are not cutting but are feeling the urge to do so. The time to receive help is when you feel the urge to engage in dangerous behavior. I would strongly advise that you speak to your parents about seeing a therapist. A therapist could assist you in the development of alternative and healthy methods of dealing with emotional pain. There are many effective strategies in dealing with emotional pain, difficult feelings, and so forth but cutting is not among them. This is the prime opportunity to receive preventative help. Please consider my recommendation and please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve been with my boyfriend for 7 months…One month of which was when he broke up with me in late March and we got back together in late April. When I first met him, he said something along the lines of “Girls are LUCKY if they ever meet my friends and family.” I didn’t give much thought to it, because I thought, well, maybe he’s just saying that. When we broke up in March, he dumped me saying I had too many demands and he couldn’t provide the love that I needed. When we got back together in late April, it turned out that he said he did a lot of thinking and couldn’t let me go because he “saw me in his future.” Still in love with him, I got back together with him. Well, one day, I was cleaning his room (which I HAVE NEVER done for another man in my life ever before–I wanted to show him how special he is) and I noticed two hairpins on his end table that were not mine. I also noticed that the condoms he said “he ran out and bought because he was afraid of getting me pregnant while I started the birth control pills” were suddenly gone from the windowsill where they were a week ago…..I hate to say it, but 2 months into our relationship, we weren’t using condoms, and we still aren’t. (I got tested last week and am clear…but now I’m rethinking the non condom thing…stupid..I know). So, my suspicions started. The next week, alone in his room (He lets me stay alone and sleep in in his apartment when we go out sun night, or a week night while he works–I have a weird not-too-typical schedule). So, I snooped. Yes. I did:( And, in a suitcase he uses as extra storage for his clothes, I found the clinic condoms that had been taken from the windowsill along with a box of Trojans (a ten count box) with only 4 condoms left. There was also an empty Trojan wrapper in with the rest of the condoms. Along with that, were my earrings and panties I had left a week before. Keep in mind, we have not used a condom since March, and before we got back together in April he moved from one apartment to a new one. Next, yes, snooped again:(, I checked his wallet (He didn’t bring it to work with him–just cash in his pocket). In his wallet was a condom and a card to an escort in the area he lives. The following week when he got up to use the bathroom, I looked back in the wallet, and I noticed an additional condom put into the wallet (one was missing from the pocket in the suitcase) and the escort card was gone. I confronted him about all the condoms, and the wrapper, but I never mentioned the escort card–I still don’t know why I didn’t. His explanations were: “Those were old clinic condoms I put back in there that we were gonna use.” Then he said the box was old and he just found it recently. When I pressed him about the condom wrapper, he said it was old. I said “Then why is the lube wet in it?” He finally said, in April, before we got back together, that he slept with a one night stand from a bar, and that must be the wrapper from the one night stand. He said silicone lube can stay wet if enclosed in a dark suitcase. True. I called the condom company, and they confirmed it can happen if its in a dark place:( yes, I know, already, sounds like I don’t trust him. When I asked about the wallet, he said that he carries condoms in his wallet because his brother who suffers from schizophrenia (paranoid type) checks his wallet to see if he has condoms every time he visits him to make sure that he is protected during sex because if he doesn’t he’ll tell the mother and the mother will get angry because he already got a girl pregnant. (I also know about his son and his sons mom–he visits every Friday, sometimes fri and sat). I said, “well doesn’t your brother know we do it at your place, and you’re with me?” He said, “He doesn’t believe things he cannot see.” Okay, so that’s that part of it. Now, he won’t introduce me to his family because he says that it has to be over a year until I meet them. he says he won’t introduce me to his friends because, well, before we got back together in April, he said I needed “tweaking” I told him to accept me like I am or not, and then he stopped saying that when we got back together. Then he said his friends are busy all the time, and now he says I can’t meet them, because his friends are “stupid.” Okay, so we go on dates, but since we’ve been arguing about these issues, he rarely initiates calling me/texting me–unless I ask repeatedly. He says its because, every time I have seen him in the past two months, we have had a disagreement. When I have confronted him, he says he does this with every girlfriend he has been with–it takes a while to meet ppl he knows. I feel confused. The not calling, texting, and the random circumstantial evidence in his room–is it cheating? Or is it just typical guy forgetfulness sloppiness and distance from fighting too much? And not introducing….does he really do this with everyone, or is it just with me? because I’m embarrassing, or a dirty little secret on the side? Please help! My last long term relationship was highly physically abusive (he knows this) and I just want a loving fulfilled one. Although, I still have extreme anxiety–I’m not perfect at all, either. [/INST]  Hmmm – Let’s review: Hairpins that are not yours, condoms you aren’t using are missing, new condoms have been used and the wrapper for one is there, he is with his ex every Friday when he visits his son, and keeps a rubber in his wallet to keep his brother happy. Won’t introduce you to his friends or family and rarely calls or texts you.What is it you love about this guy?The bottom line is you just want a loving, fulfilled relationship. Without assuming he will change one bit — can you tolerate everything the way it is? If not, it is time to give him his walking papers.But if you can tolerate it, a couples counselor may be necessary to help with the issues. The find help tab at the top of this page can help you find one in your area.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am so out of touch with reality I don’t know what to do anymore. There have been times where I believed I had some sort of ability, fantasized about killing people and willingly ‘chose’ insanity (which is insane). I’m mentally confused and have terrible memory. I spend, at times, 90% of my waking hours in mental fantasies that are too often disgusting. I talk to myself 100% of the time I’m alone, like I’m a different person. I don’t have a split personality, but at one(more than one) point I tried forcing myself into having one. I think it’s some sort of emotional disorder that started this behavior, maybe out of a feeling of emptiness or left out and this being my way of feeling special, or possibly rebelling against a world that left me feeling alienated. A lot of these insecurities are gone now but my habits have gone too far, and it’s driving me crazy. I don’t see an end to it, and it’s messing with my ordinary thoughts and the way I think them. The bad memory was from a carbon monoxide leak in the room across from mine(for the years I had these habits). Could they be the source of all this? I have negative sexual habits toward amount of masturbation and what I do it to. I’ve worked a lot on this and gotten into what I would call a ‘normal’ routine but there’s always the thought. It’s just another terrible behavior I forced myself into for no reason. I have this imaginary meter in my head, and when I move in a certain way I automatically counterbalance it until it ‘fits’. I’ll also second guess a lot of my thoughts, and then second guess that and so on until my head hurts. It’s like I split myself into two angles when I’m talking to myself, or deciding to do certain things, but I’m still controlling both sides, and I know in the back of my head how stupid it is, but it’s so ingrained in me that I can’t stop it. I have so much more to say, but I’m meeting the character limit. [/INST]  It’s possible that your exposure to carbon monoxide is contributing to your symptoms. Case studies have shown that exposure to carbon monoxide, without loss of consciousness, can affect new learning ability, sleep, and memory. It can also cause headaches, dizziness, depression, anxiety, and problems with psychomotor function and balance. If you haven’t consulted a physician about possible side effects, you should. You might choose a neurologist who specializes in treating individuals exposed to carbon monoxide.In addition to a physician, it would be helpful to consult a mental health professional. Mental health treatment shouldn’t be a last resort option. When you are in distress, you should enter treatment. It could provide a great deal of relief and eliminate your symptoms.

I’m mostly posting this out of curiosity as I’d like to know more if possible, though I’m not really expecting a reply. [/INST]   The way to understand this is to realize that your concern is enough to have a one-time meeting with a therapist. You obviously are anxious about your reactions and, rather than try to label it one way or another, it may simply be best to talk about the concern.You’ve taken a good first step here, and I would encourage you to take the next step and discuss this with someone.

"<s>[INST] I binge and purge almost every day but I’m not sure if I’m bulimic. My binges are not always followed by purging and my purging in not always preceded by binging. Sometimes I like the full feeling. Sometimes I’m just searching for the feeling of relief I get when I vomit. I don’t think I’m preoccupied with my weight. Also, I’m genuinely overweight so afraid to discuss this with my psychiatrist in case he thinks I’m making it up. [/INST]  Whether or not you have a specific eating disorder can only be determined by an in-person, mental health evaluation. Binging and purging is unhealthy and most often requires professional mental health treatment.You are correct about binging and purging damaging your body. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of all mental health disorders. Eating disorders can cause severe malnutrition and many sufferers die from heart failure or organ damage.You should not be ashamed to discuss these issues with your psychiatrist. Without your input and honesty, your psychiatrist cannot properly treat your condition. Your silence is severely hindering your care.Seeing a psychiatrist might not be enough for you. The most effective treatments involve both medication and therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is particularly helpful for the treatment of eating disorders. CBT can help you to identify and alter the irrational thought patterns that may be underlying your self-harm activities. Studies consistently show that therapy for eating disorders is quite effective.I would strongly urge you to discuss these issues with your psychiatrist. Ask him or her for a referral to a therapist. Do not continue to keep this problem a secret because you may be doing irreversible damage to your body. There is no reason for you to continue to suffer with problems that are highly treatable.

"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I have been in my teachers class for about a year now. Just three days ago, he gave me his number in case I was having any problems and needed to talk. I texted him two days ago and asked him for advice. It was fine in the beginning but then he started telling me he cared about me and he asking if my body was all natural. I flipped out and deleted the messages. Then I sent him a text back telling him he shouldn’t be doing stuff like this. He started saying how he needed help and that he wasn’t a role model. I told my mom ad she called the police. The police couldn’t do anything because I deleted the initial texts. The school could so though. The worse thing that could happen to him is him lose his job. I haven’t been able to feel like me since then. I’ve been crying all the time. He was a very loved teacher at my school. I just want to be happy and feel like myself again help? [/INST]  You did exactly the right thing. You refused to be victimized! That says to me that you are stronger than you think you are. It is absolutely not your fault that this guy was inappropriate with you. His job is not your responsibility. You didn’t put his job in jeopardy. He did.It doesn’t surprise me a bit that he is “much loved.” If he is an offender, he works at bringing kids into his orbit by being extra kind and offering help. Lots of teens go through difficult times and are therefore emotionally vulnerable to someone who seems sympathetic. Sadly, not all helpful adults have pure motives. My guess is there are other kids who have also been approached, but who didn’t speak up. I certainly hope the school is going to investigate further.Please hold your head up high. You have every reason to be proud of yourself. Not only did you resist this guy’s attempts to get inappropriately involved with you, but you may well have prevented him from victimizing someone else. If you are still upset when you get this reply, please ask your mother to make an appointment for you to see a therapist. You may need a little more support for awhile.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have a mother who has always been too controlling all my life and likes to give advice about everything even though I never ask her for advice. I am a grown woman, married and have a gorgeous healthy 4-year-old daughter. She gets colds from kids, very normal of course. I feel I have healthy parenting techniques and think that my child is pretty darn healthy compared to a lot of other kids. She has never even had to go on antibiotics. My mother will come and help babysit or my daughter may stay overnight at her Grandma’s to get babysat but half the time, she has had a slight cough, or gets snotty – I’m very conscious of it, but I’m not concerned about it as it may be due to allergies. I also get a lot of hay fever. The main problem is my mum won’t stop with her constant worries and nags about how my daughter is sick and thinks she should see a doctor and it’s not right and she emails me and text messages me every time she babysits. I think it is excessive and a constant burden on our relationship how she is obsessed about this health issue. She is also a nurse, so she thinks she knows everything about coughs. How can I not get frustrated and stressed out from her constant harassment about negative talk/issues on the same subject over and over again, it’s like a broken record. My mum thinks she is normal though, but she’s not the way she repeats herself about the same things and she always forgets things I’ve told her. I’d really like my mum to see someone for anxiety as she has often rung me up and overstepped the line verbally abusing me on the phone telling me what I should do with my child. I’m exhausted and no other family members (all men) want to be bothered to get involved (even her partner, my step dad). Please help me, as I’m sure my mother is lonely at home and obsessed about my daughter’s health when there is clearly nothing wrong with her. Your thoughts greatly appreciated. She won’t see a counselor with me either. [/INST]  I understand how frustrating this kind of “help” can be, yet I believe this may be an opportunity to get the communication and your mom’s needs aligned. I would do two things. Explain to your mom that you understand how she wants to help and that there needs to be a better way for that to happen for both of you. Explain to her that you believe she is right—that both of you need a professional opinion and a way to move your communication forward.I would set up a joint appointment with the pediatrician and have the pediatrician render an opinion of what normal is. Your mother is likely to respect what the doctor says, and both of you get to plead your case. If the cough is something that the doctor thinks is a concern, then you have a chance to negotiate with your mom how to deal with things in the future. If the cough is a normal part of being a kid, then you get to negotiate with your mom about future conversations.Use the physician as an intermediary as you might a counselor. Both of you are trying to do the right thing out of love and concern. Let’s see if there is a way to do this with less wear and tear.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S: I’m extremely uncomfortable around my step father. I’m young,13. so i’m not sure if this is just me being dumb, but I am really uncomfortable and feel really anxious around my step father. I’ve overheard my mother and his arguments, and they are apparently fighting because he cheated with multiple women, and because he’s acting like a child. [/INST] I am so glad you wrote. You may be young but you know, as well as anyone older would, what is inappropriate and threatening behavior. What he is doing is a big deal. It is no laughing matter. Intentional behavior is not a “slip.” His “tickling” is abuse. Being “very sexual” is not an excuse for crossing boundaries with kids.No kid should feel scared and unsafe in her own home. No kid should be worried about what her stepdad will do next.Since you don’t quite trust your mother to do what she should, please, please talk to your school guidance counselor or a teacher you trust right away. Ask them to meet with you and your mom to support both of you and to help your mom understand what she needs to do in this situation. Your stepdad needs to leave. Hopefully, knowing what you have been going through will tip the balance so that your mom can decide to get this cheating abusive guy out of the house and out of all or your lives before something worse than “tickling” happens.Trust your instincts and good sense. This situation isn’t good for anyone.I wish you well. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Q. I seem detached from some things, while being too deep into other things. Also, i sometimes feel like people and even tv are giving me “signals”. i know how stupid and crazy this all sounds so i’m hoping that’s a good thing, but i have lived with this all my life and can’t imagine it any different. it has been mostly comforting, feeling like i am not alone and people might know everything i have been through and understand me. But i don’t want to be crazy and i want to put a stop to this once and for all. I’m getting ashamed at some of the thoughts i am having now and it’s making me feel really stupid and crazy. it’s very distressing feeling like people are watching you even on the toilet, then realising that you’re insignificant so it can’t possibly be happening. People on tv i think like me and say certain things for me, then i remember that i’m stupid and crazy and weird looking and get embarrassed because i had that thought. my mind is switched on all the time so i can’t even sleep, i am just running imaginary conversations in my head where i can be myself and people can see that i am a nice person but i even get embarrassed by my behaviour in a fantasy scenario! i don’t want to be crazy any more, i want this to go so i can live my life normally. i would appreciate some advice or some kind of feedback, anything please. it sounds so much more stupid seeing all my thoughts written down, i’m worried. thank you for taking the time to read this. [/INST]  Some people have referred to the type of delusion that you are describing as the “Truman Show” delusion. The name stems from a famous movie starring Jim Carrey in which he discovers that he is living in a fictional world in which his every move is being broadcast. The “Truman Show” delusion is not listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Health Disorders, the official guide used to diagnose psychiatric conditions. Its closest classification might be delusional disorder, persecutory type.Two researchers documented five cases of patients who described experiencing the “Truman show” delusion. It was their belief that the patient’s were experiencing persecutory and grandiose delusions. They speculated that the “Truman show” delusion may be a “product…of the contemporary popularity in our culture of reality television.”It’s very encouraging that you’re able to recognize your symptoms. Many people who experience psychosis are unable to recognize their symptoms and even deny them. You also seem to want help. Being able to recognize your symptoms and being open to treatment positively influences your prognosis. My recommendation is to undergo a mental health evaluation. The evaluator can make an official determination regarding a diagnosis and recommend a course of treatment. These symptoms can likely be eliminated with medication. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  From a man in the UK: As long as I can remember, I’ve had an issue where if I am holding a partner for more than 5-10 minutes, I get really physically tense. It builds in intensity, to the point where I just have to break away into my own space for a while. It can happen sat on the sofa, or when going to sleep. I don’t feel emotionally distressed, just a build of muscular tension where I really need to tense muscles as the tension builds to unbearable levels. It does feel like I need to escape/run, but I’m not at all emotionally panicked, it’s just a physical response to something. It’s rather like a purely physical portion of a fight/flight response. [/INST]  Have you considered the possibility that this is a symptom of a sensory processing disorder? The cause of tactile-defensiveness such as you describe is often not an outcome of trauma but rather is neurological in origin. I suggest you do some research about it and see if it fits. If so, do consider seeing an Occupational Therapist for suggestions for treatment.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have always felt off for as long as I can remember. I have had bad relationship after bad relationship. I have been with men who have made me feel awful, but I have also treated them awful. I feel trapped in this awful life, I can’t find happiness! I don’t find joy in much of anything as hard as I try. I have to kids and love them to pieces, but sometimes it’s even hard for me to want to continue being a mom. Sometimes I want to run away because I feel like they deserve someone better. I have struggled to come up with something to pinpoint what exactly my problem is. I have tried counseling so many times and it gets nowhere. I KNOW that I have something wrong… But everyone tells me all the things I am experiencing are normal. Are they? I just can’t accept that. I can’t seem to get along with my mother, I can’t seem to be happy without a relationship, and I fall in “love” so fast, and way to easy. I stay even when I know I shouldn’t. I feel like I am not capable of doing anything, I feel like the biggest waste. I have anxiety about so many things! I drink more then I’d like and hate it, I recently picked up gambling, which has ruined everything. I can’t do a lot of things unless I’m drinking. I can’t seem to make friends, and only because if I’m sober I wonder why they would ever want to be my friend. I can’t have sex when I’m sober, because I have horrible anxiety that I am doing everything wrong. I have the same anxiety about a lot of other aspects in life as well. I rarely even try new things anymore because I just know I never can, and never will be able to do it. I don’t know what is wrong with me, but I just want to know that it can be fixed! I don’t want to live my life so sad, and lonely. I don’t want to waste it. [/INST]   First thing’s first. The way you describe your feelings about drinking and the anxieties that follow suggest it is time to visit a self-help program. Here is a link to Alcoholics Anonymous. I think this is a great place to start. I encourage you to attend an open meeting nearby and see if this will help.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"

"<s>[INST] My wife is good at pleasuring me in bed, I’m happy to say. Also, she definitely enjoys making love to me. However, she has a behavior which I find very peculiar; I have slept with several women before I met my wife, and none of them did this. [/INST]  I think so too. Take her statement that she doesn’t want to feel “overwhelmed” as the truth. She doesn’t want ever again to feel overpowered and out of control of what is happening to her. It is impressive that she has come so far that she is able to enjoy pleasuring you and to participate as a sexual partner. It’s only sad that her victimizer has deprived her of the spontaneous abandon and sexual satisfaction that can come with totally trusting one’s partner.You didn’t mention if this has become a difficult issue between you. If it has, I suggest that you be as sympathetic as you know how to be. Tell her that because you love her and are married to her, you are also being affected by the crime. You hurt for her and you get upset that you can’t be as close to her sexually as you’d like to be. Ask her if she would be willing to participate in some couples therapy so that the two of you can work together to get the perpetrator finally out of your lives. Don’t pressure her. She already has had a profoundly negative experience with pressure. Do offer your love and support and your willingness to respect her pace. If she isn’t willing to work on it, enjoy the unselfish way she loves you and give her time. With time, she may be able to relax into your love as well.I wish you well.  </s>"

"<s>[INST] From Canada: My brother started by reading about the chi power and other stuffs related to it. He is 15 years old and in 10th grade of high school. After almost 2 months, he told mom that there is no reason for him to study, this is not what he wants to do and that he will work a part time job to get money to rent his own apartment, and that he will take a career related to the power and soul stuffs that he reads about. [/INST]  Your brother is lucky, indeed, to have such a caring sister. Unfortunately, you and your mother probably can’t convince him as long as you are in a fight with him. Although I absolutely agree with you that it would be better for him to finish high school, I know that fighting with a teen who is on a mission never goes well.It might be more effective to talk with him about how he can get ready to leave. That means getting an after school job and saving enough money to be able to get that apartment. It means identifying and learning whatever skills he needs to successfully live on his own.Does he know how to shop, make decent meals, do his own laundry and manage money? Does he have a realistic budget for what he will need to support himself? Does he have enough money in the bank to buy a used car when he is old enough? Does he know what he needs to do to maintain one?Don’t overwhelm him. Do have a serious talk. Stress that you do want him to be successful out there but you are concerned. He won’t be at home for the important years when most young people make the transition to adult life. Sincerely offer to give him a crash course over the next months or year to help learn what he needs to know to be independent and successful. If he takes you up on it, do keep your end of the bargain. He needs to learn those skills for independence regardless of what he decides to do about school.Meanwhile, encourage him to teach you as much as he can about the power of chi. See if you can come to an understanding of why it is so important to him. If you express interest, he may not need to be in such a fight. If you learn more, you may be able to have a more useful conversation with him about what he needs to do to pursue that interest and be taken seriously in the world.You may not be able to get him to stay in school. That would be a shame because it is much harder to get a high school degree as an adult. But it can be done. The most important thing right now is to stay in relationship with him so that he has a home to come home to and his pride won’t get in the way when and if things fall apart when he tries to live on his own.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in Australia:  I’m confused about a condition my boyfriend has, he gave me a list of things wrong with him and one said that he found bleeding “satisfying”; I don’t know what this means but I’d like to know if this condition had a name. [/INST] What it probably means is that he is self-harming. Some researchers think that some individuals who self harm dissociate from the pain by getting fascinated by the sight of their blood when they cut. For others, it may be confirmation that they have hurt themselves. There are a number of proposed names for the behavior — and there are a number of diagnoses associated with it. Without knowing more about him, I can’t give you more specific information.What I can say is that your boyfriend is in great distress. He apparently trusts you enough to share the extent of his problems with you. I hope you will urge him to get some professional help. A person in this amount of pain needs more support than you can give him. If he won’t talk to a counselor or his parents, I hope you will tell him that you need to do so — even if it means that he won’t speak to you again. Ideally, he should be involved in the decision about who to tell but if he can’t or won’t, go to a teacher or school counselor you trust and enlist their support. Loving him means doing your best to get people involved who can get him the help he needs.I also urge you to take care of yourself by going slow with this relationship. I’m sure he has some wonderful qualities or you wouldn’t love him. But he may be in such distress that he won’t be able to return your love in the way you want and deserve. Another possibility is that he may become dependent on you to “save” him by being the only person he can talk to. You can’t let that happen. As much as you might like to be the one who can relieve his pain, you don’t have the skills to do it. He needs more help than even the most loving and best intended partner can give.I wish you both well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: I have been dealing with a lot of different internal issues lately. I can’t go back to my therapist because I am bad at explaining how I feel, and I don’t have the energy to do so. I went to 3 different therapists and left them all because I felt too anxious talking to them. I don’t know what kind of help I need, and I don’t really know what is wrong with me because it feels like many different problems. [/INST] I can’t make a diagnosis or confirm the diagnoses you have. But I do have two important suggestions.First, see your medical doctor. You may be correct that the problems come from anxiety. But it’s also possible that the anxiety is caused by an undiagnosed medical problem. I’m especially concerned about your headaches.Secondly, send a copy of your letter to me and this response to your therapist. Your letter is an eloquent description of how you are feeling. It will help your therapist understand what you are dealing with. Then make an appointment. The first thing to address is your anxiety about addressing anything. You can’t do useful therapeutic work if you are so anxious you can’t begin to talk about your distress.I’m very glad you have a therapist to return to. Even if you only had one session, some things were said that can be built on. Please, please don’t quit if you get upset. The upset is exactly what you need most to be talking about. Working on it will help you get comfortable so that you can then work on the other issues.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  I am so desperate to figure out why I’m always irritable, angry, annoyed, and short tempered. I have 2 small children, ages 3 and 5. I work outside the home in marketing and really like what I do — I love my job. But I get angry at my live in partner (children’s dad), and I get angry at my kids for almost everything they do. [/INST]  I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of a letter but I can tell you that the behavior you report is consistent with depression. Contrary to popular belief, clinical depression doesn’t always show up as sadness.In some people with depression, the primary symptoms are not sadness or a low mood, but rather irritability and anger. This anger and irritability will be constant in a person with depression — it’s with them nearly all the time. Even the smallest things that weren’t a problem in the past become hugely annoying and upsetting. Worse yet, there never seems to be an end to the things that make the person angry. Nothing others can do seem to help reduce the irritability or anger.The anger can be directed at oneself or it can be directed at others or the situation that is contributing to the depression. In your case, you may be finding it hard to balance your home life with your work life. It may also be that your relationship is in more trouble than you have wanted to admit. Or there may be other life issues or circumstances you didn’t share in this letter that may be causing the hidden depression.Untreated, angry depression may traumatize your kids and jeopardize your relationship. It can also result in doing poorly at work and losing your motivation. It’s not unusual for a person to have difficulty sleeping, to lose appetite for food and sex, and to generally stop caring about things that at one time were pleasurable in life. The kind of behavior you describe is consistent with a person who may have undiagnosed depression — it’s something you should get checked out immediately by a specialist.Please make an appointment with a mental health provider to get a real diagnosis and suggestions for how to reclaim your happiness and your life. You and your family deserve better than your angry self.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I suffer from trust issues. I tend to be afraid of everyone, question their motives and avoid engaging in social situations with people I haven’t known for a long time and therefore feel comfortable with. I think my relationship with my mother makes things worse. She keeps giving me advice and gets mad if I brush her off. Most of the time, she tells me to be careful, don’t come back late at night, don’t go into other people’s houses, don’t believe what everyone is saying. It makes me feel useless and stupid, like I can’t take care of myself. It also makes me second guess all my emotional attachments. As it is, I have never been in a relationship, because I never trust the men that try to ask me out. I am not particularly anxious about not being in a relationship but I do wonder whether or not I just don’t need a partner right now, or it is a self-imposed independence search. I understand the fact that my mother, like all mothers, is worried. She is also an anxious individual in her day to day life. However, she makes me anxious as well, up to the point where I fear getting hurt or running into problems, not because I’m trying to take care of myself, but because I’m afraid she will say “I told you so”. How can I make myself take her comments more lightly, but maintain my good relationship with her. With my father having died a year ago, I feel like we both need each other more than ever. I just wish she understood she is just worsening my already conflicted mental state and that at 22, it is far too late for her to try to dictate my social life. She warns me about the world being a dangerous place, then makes fun of my hermit status and lack of extended social circle. (From Romania) [/INST]  You need a plan to individuate from your mom during this time of transition following your father’s death. Her anxiety sounds like it is fueled by her natural concern for your well-being — but with a heavier dose of anxiety and worry than may be healthy. I’d recommend putting a plan together that allows you to develop relationships with your peers to balance out your mother’s influence. If it is at all possible, I would make the goal to become independent financially and emotionally. You need to be less dependent on your mother and more reliant on yourself. Perhaps picking a date in the future — a year from now let’s say — might be a way to begin the process.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"

The good news is that your symptoms are highly treatable with medication.Is your “shrink” a psychiatrist? If not, you should consult a psychiatrist.

"<s>[INST] My fiance and I have been together for 4 years. About a year into our relationship I had to take a break from it because I had a history of violent sexual abuse that I had to get help for and our relationship was hard for me to participate in during that time. About 3 months into our break we started going out on dates and working toward getting back to normal, but we were not officially together. During this time of dating and him pursuing me he had sex with another girl. 3 years passed and he never told me about the incident — since that happened we had moved in together and he asked me to marry him. I recently found out about the sex because he left his email logged on to my computer and he was emailing her an apology for his poor behavior with her. This is the first time he has been physical with another girl, but during other parts of our relationship I have caught him sexting his ex and at one point I found him texting one of his peers at school telling her that he didn’t get enough attention from me and he wanted to kiss her and see if she was the thing missing from his life. I don’t know how to proceed with him. I love him very much and our wedding is in 2 years but I’m not sure after all of this if it is even worth the work it will be to fix our relationship. So should we work it out or should throw in the towel? [/INST]  Don’t throw in the towel until you sort through what has happened. Couples counseling right now is important.

Yet it seems there is much working with the two of you.Take the time to explore what is happening in couples therapy. Get a third person opinion from the therapist and bring the issue out where someone skilled can help you determined if trust can be re-established. If it can’t, then you throw in the towel and take the lessons forward. If it can, you’ll have established a better foundation on which to build.

I am 27 years old and afraid to tell my parents that I want to work things out with my ex boyfriend, I’m afraid to talk to him on the phone around my parents, or see him. My parents told me that if i ever moved back in with him that they would try to take my daughter from me. I am a good mother and have done nothing to deserve this. Please help I need an outside source. [/INST]  As a mother and 27-year-old your first priority is to find more independence. Your parents have too much say in your life — you are an adult and a being treated like a child. You need to plan to get out from under their control and influence. My guess is you’re living at home for financial reasons. It is time to make a plan to change that. The psychological process of this is called individuation. The goal would be to not live with your boyfriend, but to find a way to be less dependent on your parents and more self-reliant.Right now your parents have too much say into your life because you are relying on them. Even if the plan takes a year to carry out — I believe you need to move toward greater freedom. You may want to get some advice and help from the local woman center. Most counties have one, and they can help you find resources to achieve this goal. I know this may seem difficult, but the woman’s center can help, and low-cost counseling through you community hospital can be an additional resource. Until you are out from under your parent’s influence — they will continue to have more say in your life than you want.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My mother is 50, I am 18. I cant recall how long this has been going on, less than a year, however. When Im in my room I usually constantly hear my mother talking to herself and laughing hysterically to herself. Ive went in before and asked what shes laughing about and she will simply respond with “Oh, nothing.” or “Just thinking about something.” I havent asked her about who shes talking to or what shes talking about. She sometimes changes the voices as well, she does a very scratchy, forced voice that I cant exactly describe, the kind that would make your throat hurt kinda. She also does her normal voice. The laughs may go consistently from 5-10 minutes on occasion. At first when I first heard it I thought maybe she is just thinking of something funny, but its everyday now. all day. she doesnt do this stuff when she knows Im in the room. Only when Im in my bedroom, and when we spend time together like out driving she doesnt do anything like it. or when Im in the room with her. only when shes led to assume Im out of the room. Ive also caught her talking to the couch as if theres an invisible person there while Im in the kitchen. Please help. [/INST]  It must be difficult for you to see this strange behavior with your mom. It wasn’t clear from your letter if there are others in the home with you. If there is, ask them about this and talk to them about talking to your mom.If there aren’t others that live with you, you may want to talk to your mom alone, when she isn’t talking to herself. Let her know that it is uncomfortable for you when you hear her doing this. Explain that it is something that you haven’t seen her do until the past year and that it concerns you. The goal of the conversation is to begin an honest dialogue about what is going on for your mom. The dialogue will give you a chance to determine if her talking to herself is odd but harmless — or if it is an indication that she has some other issues going on.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I need to find a way to talk to a therapist, but I don’t want my family to find out about it. I live with my mom, brothers, and sister. My mom knows I’m in a bad place in terms of mental health and has said that she would support me seeing someone, but she makes fun of people we know for seeking treatment. She thinks that depression is something you can choose to have or not have. I have been suffering for 3 years and I don’t think anyone would choose this. She has told me I don’t have a right to be upset because at my age (24) I have nothing to be down about. I could go on and on about why it’s not a good idea that they know, but I think you can see what I mean. The problem is that since I have a disability she wants to know where I am all the time. I think the only way for me to get treatment would be online when she’s away, but I don’t have any money because I’m still trying to get a job. What choices do I have? I live in Illinois [/INST]  It’s a shame that your mother has such old-fashioned ideas about therapy. People go for therapy for many reasons. Sometimes they are dealing with a mental illness. Sometimes they want support to cope with a challenging situation. Sometimes they don’t want to burden or burn out family and friends so they talk to a therapist instead. And sometimes people go to a therapist for personal growth. Talking with someone who can provide perspective and experience can often be useful.Depression isn’t something you can talk yourself out of. But you can take some steps to help yourself.First: Make sure you are taking good care of yourself. Often what looks like depression is a result of poor sleep habits, lack of enough physical exercise or poor food choices. To some extent, our moods are a reflection or how we care for our body.2) You can use a book to coach you. Two books that some of my clients have found particularly useful are: “The Depression Workbook: A Guide for Living with Depression and Manic Depression,” by Mary Ellen Copeland and Matthew McKay and “Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy” by David D. Burns, M.D.3) You could join the depression support group on PsychCentral. People like yourself share what is working for them and offer each other support.4) The Depression and Bipolar Alliance website has a support group locator on it. Try this link: http://www.dbsalliance.org/site/PageServer?pagename=peer_landingThose are a few places to start. But I also hope you can stand up for yourself with your mother. At 24, you have a right to make your own decisions about what is good for you. Since you are disabled, I’m guessing that you have some health insurance to help you pay for therapy. I hope you will also eventually see a therapist if you continue to suffer in spite of your efforts to take care of yourself.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I found out my wife of 15 years was having an emotional affair with a friend of mine as a result of me being a poor husband. At what point do I stop trying to repair the damage? She has admitted the affair. She’s stating that she no longer speaks with him, but I question that. She is still very guarded of her phone, still friends with him on Facebook, etc. The reason she started the affair, and I’ve taken responsibility for this, was due to the fact that I put my work and mainly my hobbies ahead of my family for most of my marriage. I always thought she was supporting me in my hobby, but she says she was very unhappy.  And looking back I can see that now. Wish I had seen it then. However, she never told me point blank how unhappy she was. I found out about how unhappy she was about 3 months ago. I made wholesale changes in my life. I dropped my hobby right away. Starred spending as much time at home as I could. I put her and our daughter where they should have always been, first in my life. But something still seemed a little off. Then about 6 weeks into trying to work on our marriage( me doing most of the work, which I was fine with) I found out about this emotional affair. It devastated me. So now, another 6 weeks has passed. Things haven’t gotten much better. She says she’s done with him, but I question that as I said. I am still trying very hard to fix my mistakes and prove I’ve changed. However, I don’t feel she’s doing the same. My question is, because of my failures which I feel lead to the affair, should I be willing to give her more “time” to get to the point of working on her issues? It’s very difficult for me to handle the constant secrecy with her phone. I want to take it and see if she’s still contacting him, but I’m afraid that will crush any progress we may be making. I still love her very much and I do want to work this out. But at what point do my feelings and concerns become part of the equation? Thanks. (age 37, from US) [/INST]  I can understand that you are eager to get your marriage back on track and I appreciate that you are taking responsibility for your own actions. However, if you were putting your work and hobbies before your wife and family for the majority of your 15-year marriage, it’s going to take more than a few months to repair the damage. And there is a chance that the damage cannot be repaired. I have heard many spouses in similar situations say something like “It’s too little, too late.”Don’t get me wrong, your wife is not free of blame if she chose to get her emotional needs met outside of the marriage, rather than letting you know how unhappy she was. But now that things have escalated to this point it is time that you both lay everything on the table. There needs to be a period of mutual transparency in a relationship after an affair and rather than assuming that you know what the other person wants from you, it is best to ask them. You might think you are working hard to repair things while she could be thinking that you still don’t get it.At a minimum, you should both read some books on the subject, such as After the Affair, but I would strongly suggest that you seek marital counseling. I hope you can work things out.All the best, </s>"

Should i cut the relationship off to appease my parents and family? [/INST]  No, you shouldn’t cut off the relationship. At 32, you have the right to make your own decisions. But I do think you need to walk in your family’s shoes a little. Love is driving their behavior. They’ve watched you make the same mistakes time and again. They are protective of you. They are protective of your kids. They don’t know your new guy the way you do. How do they know he isn’t the same type of “mistake” in another disguise? Six months isn’t very long to know each other before making the decision to make a life together. From their point of view, it may look like you are again acting on impulse.I wish your family members were able to be kinder in expressing their concern but being angry at them for being concerned will only keep this going. Instead, think about how to help your family and your boyfriend get to know each other. This isn’t going to be accomplished with one awkward meeting. It will mean arranging for various people in your family to spend time with the two of you and your kids. Keep it light. Find ways to have fun, not confrontations. When they see that he’s a good man and that he’s good to you, chances are they will accept him.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am wondering what stage of breakup I am in. Breakup occurred three weeks ago, had been five years with him. I’m starting to accept the reality, but I’m wondering if I’m still in denial and have the other four stages of grief to go through. He (former boyfriend) blindsided me with the breakup, it was sudden. I have spent many days being extremely upset and wanting him to contact me and tell me he regrets that decision. While I still hope he eventually regrets it, I feel like I’m starting to accept he is gone and let go. This would mean I skipped the anger, bargaining, and depression stages of grief and I can’t imagine I’d be in acceptance this early. However, I don’t feel like I’m in shock as much, and I am consciously telling myself the relationship is over and I need to move on. Does this mean I’m still in denial? Or does it seem like I am transitioning to a different stage? [/INST] Not everyone experiences grief in the same way. I’m sure that you have heard that many times. Thus, I cannot offer any opinion about what “stage” you may be in.You stated that you were “blindsided” by the breakup. That you were oblivious to his unhappiness is unusual. Perhaps you were ignoring signs that it was ending. I’m wondering if he explained why he decided to leave? No matter the reason, it still hurts.Breakups are difficult. That’s because usually they are not mutual. Usually, one person doesn’t want the relationship to end and they are the ones who suffer the most. Most people can relate because they too have experienced a similar loss. Psychologically, it’s difficult to endure the pain of a breakup but it will get better with time. It sounds as if you are handling it quite fine. You seem to be moving on, as all of us must after a break up.Counseling may help to examine your situation. It’s worthwhile to examine the situation in general and specifically why you were blindsided by the breakup. It might also assist you in moving on. The best antidote to a breakup is a new relationship. Good luck and please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, my husband has started a friendship with a workmate (female) 4 months ago, she is married we met her and her family. At first I was ok with it but I started getting jealous with the way my husband is extra attentive to her- we have other female friends too but to my observation he does not behave the way he is with them. He admitted that he like her more than he like our other friends, he enjoyed picking her up from home to go to work, it was his idea to carpool. He loves inviting them for family barbeque. He said he wants me to be friends with her- I am trying but my jealousy is still here. My husband is aware that I am jealous of his friendship with this person but assures me it is only friendship, a platonic one. Is it me who just had the problem, I admitted to him that I am jealous of the time he spent with her, like he would pick her up for work but have to go earlier so that they can have a coffee at her place ( sometimes the husband is home, other times it is just her at home). He asks me if I am ok, but when I say Iam not ok with this he seems not to be able to understand.Am I just stressing myself? [/INST]  It’s very hard for me to assess a situation like this on the basis of a letter. It might be that your husband is more attracted to this woman than he is admitting to you or to himself. But the fact is, he’s been very open with you and has not acted defensive in any way – even when you asked to see his texts. That suggests that at the very least he’s trying to be respectful of your feelings.The other possibility that occurs to me is that your husband is lonely for a friend. Working night shift makes it tough to have friends or even to be as close to you as he might want to be. Then along comes this person who he not only likes but who shares the same difficult schedule. It’s possible that what you are sensing is the beginning of a romance. But it’s also possible that what you are seeing is the enjoyment of a new friend.If you two were seeing me in my office, I would want to ask you if you each have close friends you do things with and confide in. For many people, having young children and working third shift tend to crowd out having friends. Our partners can’t be everything to us. People need a social group. If your husband doesn’t have friends, I would then suggest to you that his solution is a healthy one. Make friends with her too and expand your social circle.On the other hand, if your husband does have good friends in his life, I would wonder why this particular relationship is so important that he is willing to hurt your feelings to continue it. Is he feeling sorry for a single mom? Or is he letting himself get more involved with her than he should because it is kind of exciting to be around her? The answers to those kinds of questions would help you both figure out what role this woman has in his life and if it is a threat to your marriage.I’m sorry to give you such an unsatisfying answer to your question. That always happens when an answer is “it depends.” What I do suggest you do is keep talking. Perhaps some of the ideas I’ve offered give you a different direction for your conversation. Work hard not to accuse or blame. Instead, just try to be interested in what it is that he is getting out of the relationship. Once you understand that, you’ll be in a much better position to make your own decisions.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello. My issue is about friendships and the aftermath of my toxicity. I’ve been friends with a girl X for so many years, but I noticed this summer that she seemed to be with someone else, which IS normal. However, I can conclude that her random annulment of our get-together was canceled to be with that person. I still was trying to be as nice as possible to X, but eventually, it felt like I didn’t know her anymore. [/INST] It may be difficult for you to trust girl X again knowing what she may have said about you behind your back. If this relationship is to be salvaged, then it’s important to be honest with girl X about what friend J told you.It is possible that friend J may have misrepresented what girl X said about you. Miscommunication may have occurred and thus the need for truth and clarification.It would be best to request an in-person meeting with your two friends and attempt to clarify any potential miscommunication. Direct communication and honesty may be all that’s needed to resolve this issue. Good luck and please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a young man in the U.S.: My SO is bipolar with strong suicidal tendencies and extreme anxiety. I left for 4 days and in that time she left the walk in closet for food – twice. Also puked when the maintenance guy showed up to check the smoke detector without warning. Late every night whether I’m home or away there’s at least an hour long conversation where she begins detailing, in graphic detail and a manic voice how she wants to kill herself, while I talk her down and change topics until she gets tired enough to sleep. Its been like this for a half year minimum and getting worse. [/INST] No, you can’t continue to manage this painful situation. Neither can your girlfriend. Her illness has become the most important “person” in your relationship. I’m sure this was not her intention. But she is more involved with her illness than she is with you. Quite inadvertently, and with the best of intentions, you have supported her in being ill by being as scared as she is. Talking with her in detail about her desire to kill herself isn’t helping either one of you.A session of therapy every other week is clearly not enough for this level of distress. I suspect that her therapist doesn’t understand the intensity of your girlfriend’s symptoms or she would have increased the frequency of sessions long ago.My best suggestion is that you join her in her therapy sessions for awhile — or at least for part of her therapy sessions.  If you attend even some part of the sessions, you and the therapist can focus on getting you out of being a crisis worker and back to being a loving support. Ideally, you will change the situation so you are partnering with the side of your girlfriend that wants to be well instead of the side of her that is afraid of change. The therapist can help your girlfriend shift her need for crisis intervention to someone who is trained to manage it. Her therapist, not you, should be assessing her need for an inpatient stay.Your girlfriend doesn’t want to lose you. Using you for daily crisis sessions isn’t the way to “keep” you. I think and hope that if you are clear and loving in insisting that you participate in helping her heal in a useful way by working together in therapy, she will go along. If not, by all means call your local Emergency Services Team to assist you when she talks about suicide.I wish you well. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  It started recently when I was finishing up my sophomore year of high school. I began to become increasingly paranoid (I thought people were out to get me, and that people kept staring at me, even if I was alone), that people could hear my thoughts, and I kept feeling like there was some sort of presence near me, and/or following me. Not only that, but I would have the occasional auditory hallucination. I didn’t hear voices, but rather noises people make such as breathing (as if someone were right next to me)r when I was alone (happened twice), a snarl (also as if someone were right next to me), and an exhale (right next to me; alone) , however these are minor compared to the visual hallucinations. These occurred in the corner of my eye. I would see moving shadows, full blown people (I would see them moving, sand they would be extremely detailed, but when I looked back they were never there in the first place.[this occurred 3 times]), and sometimes pictures would look like they were moving or finishing an action. Some of my other visual hallucinations I could see directly such as a face at the top of a door (occurred once), and one time I was sitting in drivers Ed and my teacher was talking about bugs when all of the sudden I see two black dots swarming around her head like flies, but it didn’t last long until they flew behind her head and disappeared. Another time I was sitting in a car and I saw a fly, fly right up to my face, so I swatted at it, but I realized that there wasn’t actually a fly, because I couldn’t find it anywhere, neither did I hear the buzzing of its wings. Another instance is when I thought I saw a bug crawling down my arm, but I didn’t feel it, nor did I see it where it should have ended up. Another time u thought I saw a bug crawling across my wall, but again I didn’t see it where it was suppose to end up (on the ceiling; it was crawling up). Not only that but when I walked down the hallways of my school, they would appear to be crooked, and moving, causing me to walk funny. Then there is other stuff like my loss of motivation, emotion (not flat effect), I would miss letters when I wrote, I began talking to my inner voice as if it were real (it talked to me first), I now have a bad attention span, and it’s now fairly hard to get my point across because I’ll get tongue tied, plus my personal hygiene is not the best, and my memory (especially short term) seems to be increasingly getting worse. That last part could be due to my dysthymia, but it still doesn’t explain the rest of the things I’ve been experiencing. I never have and never will use drugs, and I don’t take any medications. Thank you for your time. [/INST]  You mentioned having dysthymia, a chronic form of depression. It is true that some of your symptoms are not entirely consistent with dysthymia and may suggest that another disorder is present. However, I know from your letter that you’re not taking medication and thus it’s also possible that you’re not currently undergoing any form of treatment. Untreated dysthymia could be contributing to your symptoms.Other factors that could be affecting your overall mental health include stress, possibly an undiagnosed medical problem and insomnia, a common symptom of dysthymia. A lack of sleep impairs concentration and many other cognitive functions. In fact, an international team of researchers discovered that 24 hours of sleep deprivation can cause psychotic-like symptoms among otherwise healthy (non-psychotic) individuals.It’s important that you are evaluated by a mental health professional. An evaluation is necessary to determine if a psychotic disorder present. Medication could help with many of the symptoms you have described. Counseling would be especially helpful for your ongoing depression symptoms.Ask your parents to assist you in finding a local mental health professional who specializes in depression among youth. Your symptoms are highly treatable and are unlikely to go away by themselves. They should not be ignored. A mental health evaluation would answer your questions and would be the first step in a cure. Thanks for your question. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  Ive been depressed for 4 years now and Ive noticed that I have changed dramatically as a person. Right now though, the thing that bothers me the most is that I seem to find it hard to maintain a friendships. And Ive been told its because I don’t trust. Before I was depressed, I never had issues. I never doubted my friends. I took their yes as a yes. Now my mind analyses everything to an extent where I get terribly drained and tired from all the thinking. I was such a simple person before depression. And I dont like being like this because Im making things hard for my friends..because Im always doubting them OR guessing things that I think they might be thinking..which 99% of the times are wrong. Why do I have doubts? If I love my friends like I know I do, why do I analyse everything, and say “if this, if that” etc. I was never an insecure person…does this mean I am now? I want things to be simple..but depression makes it so hard. I feel like I should isolate myself from others..because I cant be a true friend if I cant truly trust them. I make life hard for them. And I dont want too. Maybe Im too over protective.Maybe Im too attached to the extent where I go over board. I dont know. Im sure its all depression related..but how can I trust my friends more.. or at least..not show them my doubts. Please help.. thank you for reading.. [/INST]  Of course. I’m glad to read this and offer what I can. I think what you are referring to is something called “rumination.” Rumination is when a person goes over and over and over negative perceptions. It is one of the symptoms of depression. Often the person doing it thinks it will make things better to try to think them through. But since ruminators keep finding the darker side of issues, it in fact feeds the depression and makes it worse. Since ruminating tends to be negative, friends often get frustrated and start to pull away — which only makes the depressed person feel like a failure as a friend as well.You didn’t mention if you are getting any treatment for your depression. I do hope that you are seeing a psychiatrist for appropriate medication and seeing a therapist to help you manage your thoughts. The combination of medication and talk therapy is thought to be the best way to overcome depression. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be the most effective for your symptoms.I don’t have any contacts in Greece to direct you to. But your doctor can probably help you find a therapist. I hope you follow through and get the help you need. You deserve to reclaim the ease in your life and your friendships you once had.I wish you well.  </s>"

I am with BOB and Jane has been my best friend since kindergarten. But theirs no bad blood their, but the thing is Bob cheated on jane and has cheated on almost every girlfriend he has ever had. He cheated on me by kissing his ex, then messaging a girl on facebook, and then he invited a girl over to his house. (they apperantly did nothing) The thing is i wanted to prevent all this cheating. So the day we got together, i had a threesome with him and another friend. I was hoping if i showed him he could do other girls with me, he wouldnt do it behind my back. We’ve had two threesomes and the girl from the second threesome was the girl who was at his house. All of this was a couple of months ago. We have only been dating since July 2011. I constantly worry hes cheating, i’ve wanted so badly to invest in keyloggers to see if hes cheating on facebook but i know it shouldnt have to be like that. He’s so sweet and i have never had a boyfriend who i have felt so loving on. We have not spent a night apart, but he is a high school dropout and i go to school and college. He has no job either. I love him more than anything though regardless…What should i do? Is it time to give up or do i keep working? [/INST]  I can’t tell you what to do. I think you’re telling yourself but you’re not listening. You are with a guy who has a long history of cheating. He has given you reason to think he hasn’t really changed. You don’t trust him. On top of that, he doesn’t look like a very substantial person. He isn’t in school. He isn’t working. Meanwhile, you are engaging in threesomes in order to try to inoculate him from cheating? That makes no sense. Basically that behavior gives him a message that it’s okay with you for him to connect intimately with other women as long as you’re there too. Is that really what you want to be doing?Why aren’t you looking for someone who knows how to be faithful without manipulations on your part? Why do you think you’re in love with someone you can’t trust and who is going nowhere? I don’t get it. I don’t think you do either.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My son will be 4 in 2 days. He can be a very sweet and loving little boy, but he can also be very violent and aggressive. He does not seem to have any middle ground, it is either one extreme or the other. Lately the violence has been getting worse. His sister, who is 7 and has ADHD, reminded him that he is not supposed to touch the computer when she is using it to practice her spelling words and he tried to punch her in the face. If she hadn’t moved she would have a black eye with the amount of anger that was behind that punch. [/INST]  It’s important that your son receives an evaluation by a mental health professional. It’s unusual for a child to be as aggressive as you have described. His violence might be stemming from issues of which you are currently unaware. An evaluation might uncover the root of the problem.The evaluating mental health professional may suggest family therapy. Family therapy might be the most appropriate treatment for this problem. A family therapist can interview family members, assess the family dynamic and provide you with parenting advice regarding the discipline of your children.It’s important to seek professional help as soon as possible. You stated that you need suggestions about how to handle his behavior “before someone gets hurt” but your daughter and your family pets have already been hurt by your son. At this point, his behavior is too much for you to handle without professional help.Ask your pediatrician for a referral to a mental health professional for an evaluation. You may also want to consider reading parenting books that focus on behavior modification. Behavior modification is characterized by an authoritative parenting style and providing the appropriate reinforcement or punishment of behavior. Education coupled with professional intervention should assist you in gaining control over your son’s behavior. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have a friend who is 19, turning 20. She dated a guy for 4 years in high school, after she broke up with him. Not even 4 months later she dated another guy for 1 year and he took her virginity. After this break up, her and I became a thing, we hung out, talked a lot, and eventually had sex and various other intimate moments. She decided she did not want to be in a relationship with me because she needed time for herself, to heal and finally live life being single. [/INST]  Two main reasons people stay in unhealthy relationships include low self-esteem and fear of being alone.People with low self-esteem don’t believe they deserve anyone better. They’re willing to tolerate being treated badly because, in their view, it might be their last, best opportunity to be with someone.Relatedly, some people have a great fear of being alone. They may become dependent upon a relationship and feel as though they cannot function in life independently. For some people, being with anyone, is better than being with no one at all.The aforementioned reasons may explain why your friend can’t leave her relationship. As her friend, it’s difficult to watch her engage in a relationship that you perceive as being unhealthy. You see her being hurt and it probably makes you upset.You may also feel resentful. She may ask for help when things are going badly in the relationship, but then reject it. That can be quite frustrating. If it continues, then you must decide whether or not it’s fruitful for you to continue offering her advice when she rejects it.I hope this helps answer some of your questions.

But what you are describing is consistent with the symptoms of social anxiety. You are definitely not alone in this. Millions of people suffer from it. People with social anxiety are terribly self-conscious and fear being judged by others. They worry about doing or saying something that will bring negative attention on them. Since they are so anxious around other people, they tend to withdraw and get depressed. It’s not at all unusual for people with this kind of anxiety to develop physical symptoms, like irritable bowel and TMJ.The good news is that it is treatable. The most effective treatment is cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Please do yourself the kindness of finding a therapist who is trained in CBT and make an appointment. You can get better. You can have a better life.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] For a long time, I’ve had thoughts about murder, I used to hate it but I’ve grown to enjoy it to the point where thinking about killing and playing with a person’s blood and insides sparks sexual desires. Recently I’ve been having images of blood soaking the streets, a big pile of (adult) bodies all mangled and shredded in the center and imagining rolling around and having sex on top of it all, fire and screams in the distance, I guess what you would imagine Hell to be like. (I’m not religious). I’ve also been thinking very strongly about committing a murder, especially when someone gets me very angry (I have a colleague who really likes to wind me up, almost intentionally nudging me towards doing something). Because of this I’ve distanced myself from many people. At work I can’t be around people, and part of my job is to be around people, but they’ve allowed me to keep to the sides and do my work alone. [/INST]  Obviously, it is not normal or desirable to be depressed just as it is not normal or desirable to have a fever. In both cases, something is wrong. At the very top of a list of things that should be done, would be finding a cure for your depression. Too many people believe that depression is just a normal part of life. Fever and depression are things that occur in life but they are a divergence from normalcy. In both cases, a treatment of some kind is necessary to eliminate the cause and produce a return to normalcy.If a fever is low and the depression is low, perhaps the body and the mind will overcome the cause and produce a return to normalcy. A high fever and a high level of depression, are unlikely to cure themselves and are likely to require treatment; treatment by a highly educated, trained professional. A physician and a therapist, are both highly educated specialists in their own fields. I would expect both of them to be able to produce a cure.Having a high fever is not normal and there are complications to the physical body from having a high fever. Having a high level of depression is also not normal and just like the high fever, the depression will cause complications. Curing the fever and the depression, will not only eliminate them but will also eliminate the complications caused by them.Your anger, cutting, and unhealthy fantasies are likely resultant complications of your depression. Certainly, I don’t know if that last statement is true because it is impossible to diagnose someone from a short letter posted on the Internet. Even though, I don’t know for sure, your treating therapist most certainly will know. One thing that I do know for sure, is that every symptom that you have described is treated, every day, with great success in therapy.I hope you will consider my suggestion and I wish you the best of luck. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I get stuck for hours daydreaming or mentally processing unimportant thoughts. It feels like the world through my perspective is more or less a screensaver for my mind. I typically don’t notice when my fingers or arms get cold or when blisters start to form on my feet. I walk from place to place during a normal day staring at the floor, thinking of untold numbers of inane thoughts or ideas. [/INST]  Daydreaming is perfectly normal. In fact, it is often the locus of creativity and can be an important way to take time out from stress. But daydreaming to this extent is not normal or useful. It is interfering with your life in a very big way. The problem is therefore not the daydreaming. The problem is that you are not able to control it. It makes sense to me that you have been diagnosed with ADHD since you are so easily distracted.From your description, I’d want to also look at Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). You remind me of people who report that they can’t stop playing video games or can’t stop thinking about something they wish they had done differently. OCD is often characterized by the inability to stop a thought or behavior. It’s as if the “off” switch in the brain doesn’t work reliably. In your case, you can’t shut off the daydreams.Dr. Eli Somer, a psychology professor from the University of Haifa in Israel coined the term”Maladaptive Daydreaming” (MD for short) in 2002 to name your kind of obsessive daydreaming. He and other researchers are trying to get it recognized as a psychiatric disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). In one article I read, Dr. Somers says that people with MD frequently have Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and/or Depression. You might find it helpful to search the internet for more information about MD.As far as I can tell, there is as yet no certain treatment for MD. However, some people have been helped by treating the OCD and depression with a combination of medicine and talk therapy.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in Australia: Lately I’ve been feeling no point to life and I can never think straight. My home life is horrible as i have an abusive older sister who i used to be very close with and now my parents always yell at me and call me the abusive one. I have often panic attacks, i vomited recently after a traumatic event and i can never walk away from my technology no matter how hard i try. My school life is also horrible as i feel that not even my closest friends trust and rely on me and i think i cant rely on them most of the time anyways. [/INST] Oh my. I’m so, so sorry you feel this way. The ray of hope in it is that you do have some close friends. But it is difficult to be a friend or to trust friends when it feels like nothing is going right. You are not alone in your feelings. Many teens experience much of what you are going through. What concerns me is that your feelings have become so intense.I know it will be difficult to do but I really, really think you need to talk to an adult who can help you get the therapy i think you need. If your school has a counselor, please make a visit. If not, think about talking with a teacher you trust. If talking to someone seems too hard, take your letter with you as a way to do it.Often parents are more likely to listen to another adult than to their own teen. It’s extremely painful for parents to see their kids in emotional pain. Often they want to believe it’s just a stage a kid is going through. If they feel helpless about how to help, they may get into denial about the seriousness of the problem. I never blame them for that. But most parents do come around once they understand that their kid is in serious emotional trouble and that there are ways they can help.You need and deserve therapy to help you through this difficult time in your life. You made an important first step by writing to us here at PsychCentral. Now be your own best friend and talk to someone who can help you get the practical, in person support you need.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: I haven’t felt like I’ve been at home for about a year or so. It’s like to me, my own house is just a place I live in, and that there’s nothing special about it. But at the same time, I don’t want to leave. I hate moving, I’ve done it 3 times already. I know other people may have moved more than that, but still, it’s like I want to go somewhere else. I recall a week ago, I was in my house, home alone, and stressed out about homework when I suddenly screamed, “I WANT TO GO HOME!” But a second later, I realized that I was in my house. But my next thought was ‘I’m not home’. I talked to my dad about and I have a therapist I can talk to, but, I just want to know this NOW. If I can’t make myself at home in my own house, where can I? [/INST]  I hope you will continue to talk to your therapist about this. I suspect the frequent moves have had more impact than you think. Yes. Other people have moved more, but you are only 13 and have already moved 3 times. I have heard the same reaction from military kids and from kids whose parents have made frequent moves due to jobs. It’s as if a part of you is already getting ready for the next move.The first thing to do is to talk to your parents about whether this move is the last one for a while. If so, you can relax into this place. If not, then talk to your therapist about how to embrace the new experiences and new people you meet at each place. Frequent moves do often cause feelings of loss. But they can also be seen as opportunities.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I dated this man last year for about 8 months. I wasn’t ready for a committed relationship at the time. Dated him more out of boredom. But he took it more seriously. He had alot of anger issues and was slightly emotionally abusive. One time I let him discipline my then 7 yr old boy, but he got too rough and threw him across his bed. I did not condone this and I swore to my son that he would never have to be around that man again. We had some miscommunication a couple nights later that I used to my advantage and pushed his buttons enough to make him spiral out of control and he came and broke into my house while the kids I were sleeping. No one was hurt and the kids never woke up. I broke up with him the next day after the cops escorted him home. Now to present day another 10 months later we are talking again. He has received enough counseling to help himself and I see him as different and changed for the better. I also am ready for a more committed relationship so we have been seeing each other for about 2 months now. I am so happy and we’ve apologized and he has validated my feelings about what happened that night and in general so that we can try and move on and Im making more of an effort towards a relationship this time, but my son is terrified of him. The bf and I are taking it much slower this time and not involving the kids at all for at least 6 months but will it be possible to reintroduce them and patch things up or am I being selfish for even trying? I gave them my word that he would never be in our lives again because I never in a million years thought it would be possible for him to have changed. I am at a crossroads. Thank you for any advice you have! [/INST]  as much as I’m someone for second chances the damage done to your son by a relative stranger (at the time of the abuse) isn’t going to be undone with an apology. You’ll have to make a decision between between your son and the faith you have in your boyfriend. Your son would have twice been let down by you. The first time when the abuse happened, and the second in you going back on your word.I recommend two things. First, I would set up some individual sessions for yourself with a therapist familiar with instances of abuse and domestic violence. Talk to this person about forgiving your boyfriend — and your son’s concern. If this therapy helps, and it seems as if you want to go forward, I would highly recommend a meeting with a family therapist so that you, your boyfriend, and your children can all meet together in the safe confines of a family therapist office. If you’re going to go forward — family therapy will be necessary.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve tried to ignore this for a long time. I wrote it off as some sort of shallow insecurity or maybe just something that’s a phase, like when you were 15 years old and you go through that brief ‘suicidal phase’ or something ridiculous like that. But now I’m twenty-years old, and this isn’t going away. It’s getting worse and its starting to hurt other people because of my confusion. [/INST]  This is a real issue because it has been given much thought, and there is still an unsettled sense about it.There are many factors that you have mentioned that may have contributed to this confusion, but between the cancer treatment, your creativity, and the limited social experiences it makes sense that there would be a gap, or lag in your identity development.I would begin with an individual therapist on a regular basis to start sorting through what underlying issues are, that I suspect have not been explored. The find help tab at the top of the page will give you the names of some people in your area.I would also begin to expand my social world by attending (actual not virtual) groups where like-minded folks gather. At 20 I would encourage you to start honing your writing craft. Begin taking classes with other students looking to write in your genre. This will give you a chance to make connections with others socially and intellectually, and let the sexuality and gender identity concern get sorted out over time.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m 17 years old and my father died when I was 15 or 14 or so. I didn’t really know him very well or at least I don’t have many memories of him. He had been sick from cancer for several years so I always knew he was going to die eventually, but it still came as a surprise when he died. I was shocked, but not particularly sad. [/INST]  Generally speaking, most people grieve the loss of a parent. In fact, for many people it is the biggest loss of their lives.In your situation, you did not know your father very well. If I could interview you in person I would want to know more about your relationship (or lack thereof). It would be difficult to grieve someone that you did not know well or who was not a big part of your life. That would be true even if it were one of your parents.Another possibility is the one that your mother mentioned. It’s the idea that you are “numb” to your father’s loss. That is realistically possible. It is possible that your numbness is a psychological defense mechanism. Psychological defense mechanisms are not within your control. It may be that you are not psychologically ready or able to handle the loss of your father, at this point in your life. You may be better prepared to handle his loss later in life. If so, your numbness will disappear and feelings of sadness may emerge.Unfortunately, I do not have enough information about the relationship between you and your father to know if your lack of grieving is appropriate. If this is something that you wish to explore more thoroughly, you should consider seeing a therapist. A therapist could gather many more details about your situation and better assess your lack of grieving. I wish you the best. Please take care. </s>"

I’ll call her D made me and my other friend B. hate each other. she acted like she hate her with me. and when she’s with other friend she acted like she hate me. and it got worse B suffered from Alzheimer and recovered any how we two made up with each other. and we sided against the friend who lied and betray us.but when others ask what happens you were best friends with D. but I couldn’t remember anything at all like we were bed or we had good bond.I was like no we are not I’m not closed to her.she was just a friend.and there was this one guy friend Y I used to hang out and helped me a lot in this problems my BFF suddenly starts changing and ignoring me.which I don’t know why.then I started kind of getting flashes how I used to be with D.and Y changing was hard for me.and i couldnt go out or class.i stayed at home but when other insist to me to come. i thought okay fine.and when we meet outside for tution after a long time. he would make fun of me about my clothes in front of other guys or tell them how much a temptress i am.well i’m not.I never had boyfriend and we both never were loved each other. he had girlfriend while I was he’s friend too.I can’t understand what i did wrong for him to make fun of me in front of other people.my other friends say I’m over reacting and it’s a joke.and after that I avoids him and I stopped going to tution too.and I would flinch for everything.I was not a scared kid .I’m not even scared when watching horror movies. but even when my mom touch me I flinch. and I have no motive or energy to study all I do is sleep.and I hate going outside I hate seeing people.and whenever I start study I get negative feelings and I give up. what is wrong with me? [/INST] It is not clear that there’s something “wrong” with you. Your experiences with your “friends” remind me of the film Mean Girls. It’s about a group of teenage girls who are unkind to one another because they’re competing for power. Perhaps a similar power dynamic exists among you and your friends. It’s not uncommon, especially among teenage girls, to compete for power. They may see you as a threat to their power and thus they say and do mean things in order to maintain their position.There are several ways to handle this situation. One solution is to get new friends. You don’t want to befriend people who treat you poorly. You shouldn’t tolerate abuse. Stand up for yourself and make it clear that you will not tolerate abusive treatment.If you do continue to interact with them, keep your distance. Don’t reveal personal information to these individuals because they may use it against you in the future.In all likelihood, you will face other difficult people in your life. Most people will be easy to get along with but some people are not. One important lesson to learn from this experience is not to take their treatment of you personally. They may be acting a particular way towards you because of personal struggles they have in their own lives. It likely has nothing to do with you. Befriend kind, caring people and stay away from mean, unkind people, whenever possible.If counseling is available, try it. The more support you have, the better you will feel.

I have had a lot of change happen this last year in every possible area of life but my thinking patterns just seem to be more prominent and I am pretty scared to think where they may lead. I have been in therapy for depression over the last year; but haven’t been able to bring the subject up to my therapist as there are a lot of other issues I am dealing with. I have moved, lost my job, gained a new job, lost friends and mentors, started school again after 10 years, changed career paths, etc. (This could go on for another page) So there always seems to be something to work out or that brings up issues that I want to work on. However, I am afraid that my eating, or habits are harming my overall health. [/INST]  It could be both. You’ve been dealing with a lot. Sometimes when people feel overwhelmed, they try to find something where they feel in control. In your case, that may be the foods you eat and your weight. Of course, it doesn’t really work as a coping mechanism because no matter how much you distract yourself with eating issues, your other issues are still waiting for your attention.My best suggestion to you is that you take your letter and this response to your therapist. You did a good job describing your problem. Once she knows what is troubling you, she’ll be able to ask some questions to help you verbalize any other concerns you might have. Your therapist has only what you present to her to work with. Since you do trust her, trust her with this. Your therapy will be more effective and you’ll feel better knowing that you aren’t hiding something important from the person who is trying to help you.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been dating my boyfriend for a year and a half. We had a break for four months and got back together in October. So everything was going fine and we were working things out and talking. Well then it started going downhill and I don\’t know what to do. I\’m very lost. We recently fought because my father is getting promoted and we had originally planned to go to his high school\’s prom. Well it was all very expensive and we decided not to go. My father was going to let me go to prom instead of his promotion, since we aren\’t going anymore, I was going to go to my dad\’s promotion. My boyfriend got upset and it was a miscommunication between us when everything was happening. I had called my boyfriend to express to him that I felt hurt and angry that he wouldn\’t want to be flexible and understand that my father\’s promotion takes precedence. My boyfriend is not abusive, but he does have some signs of being controlling. I love him very dearly and I don’t want to lose him. What are some ways we can effectively stop arguing so much? [/INST]  Your boyfriend may or may not be showing signs of being controlling. It is important to see the relationship for what it is and not how you wish it would be. If your boyfriend is controlling, then you should not ignore his behavior. Someone who is controlling is engaging in a form of abuse. Abuse in relationships is the attempt, through words or behavior, to maintain power and control. Psychological or emotional abuse can be just as damaging as physical abuse. Abuse in any form is unacceptable.With regard to arguing, you can only control your behavior. Even if you behaved perfectly and did everything correctly, it still may not improve the relationship dynamic. You can and should do your part to improve the relationship but your boyfriend also has to do his. Relationships require equal work from both participants.I would recommend consulting a couples counselor or an individual therapist. A couples counselor can determine what the problems are in the relationship and create a plan to improve it. If your boyfriend is unwilling to see a couples counselor, then you should attend individual therapy. The therapist could assess whether you are in an abusive relationship. He or she can also examine how you may be contributing to the arguments and assist you in modifying your behavior to improve the relationship.It’s unclear whether this relationship could or should be saved. Frequent arguing is a sign that something is wrong. Every argument degrades the relationship. Seeking outside consultation from a therapist could help this relationship immensely.

"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I’m 17 and I’ve been dating my girlfriend for a year now. She is pregnant and is having the baby which I am happy about. Her parents are a little more understanding and supportive while mine on the other hand aren’t taking it so while. Other than trying to help me and be there for me it seems like they are only there to protect themselves by not wanting people to know and making harsh rules. Its always been a constant battle with my parents even before. the baby news. They are a strict traditional family and we live in a society where generations are changing. [/INST]  It’s difficult for me to help you because the information is incomplete. How are you and your girlfriend going to care for your baby? Are you getting married? Do you have a good job? Are you planning to support the child you helped bring into the world? How are you and your girlfriend going to make sure you both get your high school diplomas? Has either set of parents offered to let the three of you stay with them while you get on your feet? If so, have you had a serious talk about rules and roles? Or are you getting ready to move into a place of your own?The answers to such questions are important. If you are manning-up and doing all you can to be a husband and father, you have the right to demand being treated as an adult. If you are continuing to act like a boy, then your parents are only treating you accordingly.It takes more than making a baby to make you a man — or a father. Rather than continuing to fight about rules with your folks, you and your girlfriend should be focusing on the future you are making for yourselves and your child. Act like a man who is seriously taking on the responsibilities of being a father, and both sets of parents are likely to show you a new respect.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I used to be a recreational marijuana user. After about 2 years of use i began experiencing panic attacks. I just ignored the attacks and continued to smoke. Whenever i did i would constantly be on alert for fear that i would have another panic attack. One day, i had a panic attack while completely sober and was sent to the doctor. He prescribed me alprazolam and paxil and sent me on my way. Ever since that initial sober panic attack i have been in this anxious and depressed state. I fear taking any kind of drug now due to an extreme fear of bodily sensations cause by bad marijuana experiences. Im afraid to drink caffeine or eat anything that could possibly cause me any anxiety or worsen my feelings. I have become so limited because of this. It started as mainly anxiety for the first month. Then during the second it evolved into more depression than anxiety. And now im in this weird state where i feel like im on autopilot. [/INST]  Unfortunately, your story is not uncommon. I am aware of other individuals who have had a similar reaction, which is that they developed mental health symptoms, specifically feelings of depersonalization, after using drugs. We could never know if it was the use of marijuana that caused you to develop the mental health symptoms but it is a realistic possibility. One thing to keep in mind about marijuana is that it is technically considered a hallucinogenic drug. I understand that some individuals use medical marijuana for severe pain associated with disorders such as cancer or glaucoma. Medical marijuana, for those purposes, is a highly controlled substance. With the marijuana bought on the street (or any other illegal drug), it is difficult to know precisely where the drugs come from or who creates them. It leaves one to wonder “what exactly did I smoke?” or “was what I smoked laced with another drug? Angel dust? PCP? Heroin? Arsenic?” It is theoretically possible that you unintentionally smoked one or several harmful or dangerous substances in addition to the marijuana. This is one of the many hazards of drug use.It would be interesting to know if you experienced mental health symptoms prior to your use of drugs. For instance, did you ever have a panic attack prior to smoking marijuana? Did you have feelings of anxiety prior to marijuana use? Knowing that information might help me to better understand how or why your mental health symptoms developed.It’s also important to consider the fact that you are currently taking several psychiatric medications. You said that you feel emotionally numb. I wonder if you were feeling the emotional numbness before you started the psychiatric medication or if it’s a recent development, something that developed after you began the medicine. I mention this because some individuals report feeling emotionally numb while on psychiatric medication. It is a commonly reported side effect of antidepressant medication, in particular. For some individuals, the emotional numbness that accompanies some psychiatric medications is considered beneficial, particularly for those experiencing extreme depression. The emotional numbness might shield an individual from the deep depths of depression, but the flipside of this is that they don’t feel happiness either. In your specific situation, it may be difficult to determine precisely what is causing the emotional numbness. This is because I don’t know if you felt that way prior to psychiatric medication or if it was the result of the depersonalization you have described. It may be difficult to untangle the truth.You’re currently being treated with psychiatric medication but you’re not feeling any better. Because of this I would highly recommend that you consider seeing a therapist. A therapist could help you deal with anxiety and depression by teaching you coping skills. He or she may also be able to assist you with your feelings of depersonalization. Some individuals who experience depersonalization benefit from hypnosis. That’s a treatment approach you might want to consider.Keep in mind that something is causing you to feel extreme anxiety. As I mentioned above, we don’t know if it’s the drug use or a psychiatric symptom, but no matter the cause psychotherapy may be the solution. If your only treatment at this time is psychiatric medicine, then you’re probably not receiving comprehensive care. If you’d like to search for a therapist please consult this directory.

Basically she is using religion to help her move forward in life and recover and become a better person. But people don’t realize that religion isn’t what fixes you it’s the people on the chruch with you. She feels like she owes her whole heart to Jesus because she believes that Jesus has been her savior. But along it has been people in the church. Because of the religion she is saying she is waiting until marriage for sex. But I believe she is using it to cover up herself because she so insecure about herself. Like trust me she I would say why but I only got400 words. Deep down inside she wants to do these things but she scared that if I see her naked or something that I will run away. We’re both overweight alot but nothing over 300 pounds. I don’t know how to handle this cause we both love each other and I’m willing to wait.

In fact, it will confirm for him that he is right. He’s not. He’s on the edge of leaving home and starting a life of his own. He would be outraged if you told him whom he can choose for a mate. You have a right to choose your partner and your happiness as well.I suggest you tell him as calmly and lovingly as you can that you understand that he wishes that you and your ex hadn’t divorced. You can validate his feelings about not wanting you to move on. Reassure him that you will love him forever and won’t “divorce” him, no matter how difficult he is. But – tell him that you have a right to love and partnership in your life, just as he does. Let him know it will be a shame if he cuts himself off from you for a time while he gets used to the idea but that you will always have your door open for him and that your heart will be with him forever.Don’t fight about it. Don’t argue. Arguing gives someone the impression that there’s something to argue about. Just stay calm and keep repeating that you love him and will miss him but it’s his choice now what he’ll do. Then hang in there. He’s likely to have a 20-year-old version of a tantrum. Stick to your plans and have faith that the love and care you’ve put into him will come back around. Just be sure to give him a way to come back without feeling like he’s giving in so his pride doesn’t get in the way of a reunion later.I wish you well.  </s>"

I see someone who, in spite of everything that has happened, still has hope in the future and believes she has the power to make things better.I’d use the resources at college. Most have a counseling center where they offer free or very low cost therapy. Talk to them about getting some services. As a backup, I’d use a local service in your area that helps match your needs with other local counseling services: http://www.ccceg.net/. Talking to a professional now about your past and future is what will help the most.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My dad is so unkind to me. He always calls me mean names like retard and bitch and fat. He tries to be a good father but nothing ever works and I can’t take being near him anymore. My mom tries to get him to stop and it never works. One time when I was telling him how I felt he laughed and when I brought up this family contract we signed promising to stop calling names he said it was all a joke and he kept making noises mental people make and saying I act like that since I get upset about his name calling. I have ADD and things like that are a sensitive topic to me and I try to tell him and he just laughs and tells me I’m the horrible one. His words have started to make me meaner to him and my family and I have started to feel depressed because of it. What should I do ? [/INST]  Thank you so much for telling us about this. Your father’s behavior is unacceptable and you do not deserve to be called those or any other derogatory names. This is a problem and it is time to do something about it. Writing us was a good first step. Here are two things you can do.First, know that the fact your father is calling you these names is verbal abuse, and it isn’t ok for him to do. The feelings you are having are legitimate — he should know better and when he laughs about an agreement that has been made this means he isn’t understanding how wrong his behavior is. Here is a free hotline  for you to call that will put you in touch with a counselor who will guide you through the next steps to get support.Secondly, at 15 you can talk to your high school counselor. He or she can help you in a variety of ways. You can even show the counselor what you have written here for starters.Don’t wait. My experience in this area is that if the child and the other parent have tried to make changes and it hasn’t worked — it is time to get some outside support.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a 12 year old in the U.S.: Day in my life: I’m doing great. Then somebody says something about me. Ex: your a buzzkill.Then I feel so terrible. I over think everything they say. I then think everybody hates me. I go home. I get so overwhelmed. My head gets hot and my vision gets cloudy. I feel like crying. My chest hurts. I believe this to be a panic attack. After I have my breakdown, I feel absolutely nothing. I don’t care . I feel numb. I end up going to sleep after self harm (which I haven’t done in a very long time). I don’t understand myself. I don’t even trust who I am because I am so young. [/INST]  Thank you for writing. You are entering a stage of life that is very, very difficult for lots of kids. The teen years are when we all try to figure out who we want to be and who we want to have as friends. Most people make some mistakes along the way. Most people feel pretty insecure in the process.There is a lot of pressure on kids these days because of social media. During a time when nobody is perfect, it seems that everyone tries to act as if they are their perfect (or sometimes their most imperfect) version of themselves — in spite of the fact that they don’t even know yet what their “self” is really like. On top of that, everything kids say on social media is open season for others’ judgments. Yikes!I don’t think you need a diagnosis. I do think you need some reassurance and some practical help. If you have supportive parents, do tell them what you’ve told me. They were teens once, you know. They may have some good advice. If you don’t think your parents will understand, talk to your school counselor. You need some help learning how to let other people’s opinions roll off your back.Please work on not letting everyone in the world be your worst critic. It doesn’t matter what other people think or say. What matters is that you figure out how to be a good, decent person. Let your own voice be stronger than the name-callers and bullies.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi. I have a history of having a relatively short temper, normally this is just shouting or nothing serious. But occasionally when I get angry I lash out physically, so I’ll hit walls or pull on my hair but I’ve never hurt anyone and it’s always been in private so no one knows this has been happening. About a month ago my girlfriend told me something that made me angry. I could feel myself getting angry and started to pace around her room, she could she I was distressed and got up to comfort me but in that moment I needed space so I pushed her away onto her bed. She wasn’t hurt she was just shocked. I hadn’t even realised I’d done it. Anyway I calmed down in the end and we’ve carried on as normal. But recently we spoke about the incident again and she told me that she’s now constantly afraid to get me angry in fear that I might hurt her or go further than just pushing her away. I love her and she’s the last person I want to hurt and it kills me that I’ve given her a reason to think these things. I just wanted to ask the question here firstly to see if you think this is a serious anger issue that would benefit from speaking to a therapist or going on a course or something. And if there’s anything I can do in the meantime to make things better. Maybe techniques that can calm me down. I genuinely don’t think I could ever hurt her, she is the most important thing in the world to me. But it scares me that I didn’t realise I had pushed her. All I want is to be someone that she feels safe around and to be the best I can be for her. Any help of advice would be much appreciated. (age 18, from US) [/INST]  It took courage to write in with your question, and I’m happy that you realize that there could be a problem and are taking responsibility for it. What could start out as a temper control issue or an impulse control issue could easily turn into a domestic violence issue. It’s not just that you pushed your girlfriend, but you have also demonstrated behaviors that are intimidating. It may seem that punching a wall doesn’t hurt anyone but yourself, but there is an implied message to the person seeing this that it could be them next time.I do suggest that you see a therapist to learn to manage your feelings in a healthy way. You are young enough that you can successfully make changes to how you identify and cope with emotions and stress. Your girlfriend shared that she is scared and you can even admit yourself that you are scared that things could get worse. The time to get help is now. Seek a therapist who is trained in anger management techniques or find a group or class on the topic. In the meantime, there are many good anger control workbooks that may help.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] I chose to leave home and study abroad at boarding school when I was eight. I have been living away from family for the past 16 years. I regret this decision and blamed myself. Over the past 16 years, I have not been very happy and my personality changed but have only realized this over the past few years. Before I went to study abroad, I was happy but ever since, I am not. The older I got, the more secrets I have and the more I keep my true self to myself. My parents and teachers have always reminded that I have to be good. Ever since the first day at boarding school, I have learned to only act good and follow the rules and never to step out of lines. People/ teachers like good and trouble-free student. [/INST]  I’m sorry that you have been struggling with these issues for so long. It is true that being raised apart from our parents during crucial developmental years can have a negative impact on our personality. However, from what I can gather, Boarding School Syndrome looks at a broader range of issues. It not only addresses being outside of your parents home but also the possibility of being sent away against your will, having harsh or abusive teachers or guardians, being exposed to abuse by peers because of the 24/7 nature of the schools, and so forth.Even though you said that you “chose to go,” I don’t feel that a decision like that should be up to an 8-year-old child. You also stated that your guardians were very nice to you and treated you like their own child. These factors are in your favor, and I am hopeful that you can still learn any skills that you may have missed by growing up in a boarding school. You did not mention any type of abuse either, so again, this is in your favor.If you focus your energy on reconnecting to your family now that you are reunited, making friends and broadening your social support system, chances are that you will start feeling better about yourself and your life. I think it would be a great idea to find a therapist to help you fill in the gaps you may be missing. Especially one who has expertise with early childhood attachment issues.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I did this all the time as a kid, talk to myself like someone was there. Not like talking with myself to solve problems but just like normal friends having a conversation. It will be a completely animated conversation about anything good and disturbing. And I’l look right where I think whoever I’m talking to (someone made up or sometimes famous or whoever) is standing there. I know it’s not real or reality but the fantasy of pretending is nice. I function at work and home fine but I do this everywhere ,work, home, out, everywhere. I used to think its normal but now in not so sure. [/INST] As long as this isn’t interfering with your work or with your relationships, I see no harm in it. I don’t know if it is “normal”. I don’t even know if it is unusual. I suspect that people who do this don’t talk about it much with others so there is little data about it.From my point of view, you have a vivid imagination and enjoy your fantasies. People often put their imagination to use. You might  consider whether you would enjoy participating in community theater or if you have some talent as a writer.I wish you well. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Recently ive been under a lot of pressure from filling out college applications, failing two of my classes, and swimming 6 days a week. I thought i would get better after i finished my applications and got my grades up but i just feel worse. Im always angry when im around my friends and whenever im alone i feel depressed. I feel like quiting everything just because i think that it will make everything go away. Im not sure whats going on. Ive tried talking to my parents and friends but no one seems to understand what im going through. I just feel so depressed and angry all the time for what seems like so reason. On some days, for no reason, ill be in a good mood but it instantly goes away the following day and everyone seems to be pushing me away and its getting to the point where im not sure what to do anymore. [/INST]  You’re under a lot of pressure. Feeling depressed and angry are possibly the result of your current stress. Applying to college can be stressful. The act of filling out college applications might solidify the reality that in the very near future, your life is going to change. Completing college applications means you are essentially “putting it in writing” that you will be leaving your home, your family and your friends. Anticipating such a major life change might be causing you more stress than you realize.Failing two classes is obviously problematic. It could derail your college plans. Your parents are likely upset that you are not passing. The added pressure of having to attend swim practice almost every day may simply be too much for you to handle at this time. It is important to recognize your limits.Is there anyone with whom you could confide about how you are feeling? Is there a mentor, a guidance counselor, a trusted teacher, caregiver or parent in whom you trust? It can be highly liberating to discuss your fears and frustrations with a trusting, caring objective party.If your symptoms persist, consult a mental health professional. A psychotherapist could help you to develop problem-solving skills that could positively affect the quality of your life and improve your mood. A few sessions with a trained psychotherapist might be all that is needed to help you get through this difficult time in your life. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  From the U.S.: I have been plagued all my life with a lack of memory for practically my whole past. I have a handful of memories for my entire childhood; none for junior high school; very little for high school and, pretty much as soon as an event in my life is over, I have just a little bit of memory of what I experienced. But the fact of my childhood and early teenage years basically being erased in my memory banks, is the hardest to live with. [/INST] At 69, memory issues are common, but you say this has been going on for your whole life. There are many possible medical reasons. I hope that you talked to your primary care doctor about it long ago.There are also possible psychological explanations. Chief among them is that life changed dramatically in some way at some point in your life that made memories of what happened before it no longer relevant. You see, memory isn’t like a video library. What we remember is selective. Usually, memories in some way confirm how we look at the world today.If you were seeing me in therapy, we’d be talking about why this is bothering you so much now that you wrote to us. We would look at whether something happened that changed your perceptions of the world so much that you discarded memories that didn’t fit. We might also discuss whether it would be helpful to you to try to connect with childhood friends for some reminders about what once was. It’s complicated.If this continues to trouble you and your medical doctor sees no reason for memory lapses beyond what is typical at your age, then by all means see a therapist who can explore it with you.I wish you well. </s>"
"<s>[INST] When I met my boyfriend, it was an instant attraction on the phone. He was a friend of a friend and came highly recommended. When I met him finally it was an instant attraction in person. We both felt like it was just right. The glitch, to the perfect story comes a few months after we started dating. He misses dinner and a weekend we were supposed to have together and doesn’t return my phone calls. [/INST] I am concerned about several issues in this relationship. First, you did not seem to have any indication that he was using drugs. Apparently, he must have been using a substantial quanity of drugs for a significant period of time. How do I know this? For two reasons: He is at the point of detoxing, and you typically do not detox after using just a little bit of cocaine and secondly, he has “pissed away everything [he] own [s] or [is] worth on cocaine.” While, I admittedly do not know the extent of his use, (nor do you it sounds like), or just how severe his drug problem really is, I can say that based on a few items from his letter, his drug problem is significant. This is especially evident when you add in the fact that his drug habits have caused him to blow his life savings on drugs.My second concern about this relationship is that you are willing to stay with him and stick it out and you are willing to do this without really knowing the facts about him. If you did not know he was using drugs, there may be other aspects of his life that you do not know about him. You did not know he was using cocaine and now you find out that he has been using and has managed to spend his life savings on cocaine, yet this does not seem to bother you. Why not? This should scare you. That is, why would this man be acceptable for you? You mentioned that you have only known this man for a short time. In that short period of time, he has blown you off, revealed that he has a significant drug problem and no money to his name. So in essence, he is a drug addict with zero money and a known liar and these facts all emerged in the short amount of time that you have known him. These are red flags that indicate that this guy might not be the best choice for you. It is likely that he was high many of the times you were together.I am not denying that he is not a nice guy. He probably has a lot of good qualities. You should not be willing to accept these men into your life. Why not seek a mate who is not using drugs or sending all his money to support a drug habit? There are plenty of men out there not using drugs. To paraphrase Maya Angelou, “people always show you early on who they are and if you don’t hear it it is because you are just not listening.” What this means for you is that he is showing you his true colors right now, early on. He may not always have a drug problem, people do recover but as you mentioned, the relapse rate for many substance abusers is extremely high. Do not assume he’ll go through detox and everything will just been fine. This is usually not the case.Only you can decide if you want to stay with him. Perhaps you should consider a narcotics anonymous meeting for the family or friends of those using drugs. Going to one of these meetings might help you decide whether or not you should stick it out with your boyfriend. The odds are, unfortunately, that he will relapse. He has lied to you, hid away a very series drug habit and lost of all his money. He is really not in a position to have a healthy relationship at this point in his life and frankly, I am not sure why you would consider this person to be a potential mate for you, especially since you barely know him. I hope I have helped elucidate some of these issues for you. Good luck. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am having an impossible time with my 6-year-old daughter. She lies, is defiant, occasionally violent, and occasionally, nearly impossible to be around. From the minute she wakes up in the morning she starts challenging us and I really don’t know what to do. I’m concerned for her safety and well being and don’t know where to get help. [/INST] This is so, so hard. You love your daughter and want to help but she is wearing you out. You know that you and your husband do well as parents since your other two are doing fine. But there’s something about this one. . . You are already doing the kinds of things I would normally suggest for managing an out of control child. So we need to go deeper – or at least somewhere else.I recently read a book called “Raising your Spirited Child” by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka. The author talks about children who are more intense, sensitive, perceptive, persistent, and uncomfortable with change than the average child. She has some excellent ideas about how to make these kids more comfortable and how to cope with the tantrums and blowups when they occur. Why don’t you check it out and see if your daughter fits the description.Another source of help is a child or family therapist. I entered your city into the therapist locator on our homepage and found over 30 profiles of therapists. Make some calls and find a therapist who has experience working with strong-willed little kids. Not everyone has that experience. Someone who does will be able to offer you some practical help as well as some support.I do think it’s important for you to get hold of what is going on before the next baby arrives. As the mother of 4 myself, I know only too well how hard it is to juggle all that we somehow do. You have 6 or 7 months to focus on making things at least a little better before you have to divide your time and attention even further. I hope you and your husband will commit to focusing on doing what you can to strengthen your family now so you can be more relaxed when the baby comes. I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: I have been unable to find what anxiety disorder I am suffering from for years, and when I had a therapist years back, she never diagnosed me either. I’ve been able to manage it thoroughly and in a healthy manner, but I want to have an official diagnosis (or a predicted diagnosis) in order to finally replace “I have an anxiety disorder”with “I have _____”. [/INST] There is nothing wrong with you. It is absolutely normal for you to be upset by your father’s behavior. Unwanted touching, staring, trying to see you when you are undressed, and isolating you from friends are not normal fatherly behaviors. From your description, you have every right to be concerned. He is overly controlling and invading your reasonable boundaries for privacy. No child or teen should be this anxious about her safety in her own home.I worry that years of this treatment has worn you and other family members down. Your father has everyone convinced there is nothing they can do to stop him. Guys like your dad rely on secrecy and fear. That’s what gives them power. The reality, though, is that your father cannot keep doing these things if you and other members of the family make it clear that it is not appropriate and that it will not be tolerated.If you feel safe doing so, tell him clearly, very loudly, and repeatedly that you don’t like it. But it is not just up to you. Tell your mother and grandparents every single time he crosses your boundaries. The adults should be putting a stop to your father’s behavior. If your family won’t support you, please talk to your doctor, a school counselor, or another adult you trust and ask for help. If you can, make an appointment with a mental health counselor. Counselors often know what steps to take to make you safe.Meanwhile, start quietly working on plans for leaving home as soon as you can. Do well in school so you can go on to university or so you can get a job at graduation that will let you move out. You’ll feel a bit better if you start taking some steps to get to safety.I wish you well.  </s>"

I’m aware this isn’t normal and I was wondering if I really should seek help. [/INST]  Yes, you should seek help. You are fortunate to have access to a therapist and you should be telling her about your concerns. If you withhold information from her, it will be difficult for her to help you. For therapy to be effective, your honesty is paramount.The reason for your thoughts may not be evident to you, which is why you need to discuss these matters with your therapist. You are not a trained therapist but she is, and she can help. Therapists are trained to deal with these types of problems. She’s not going to judge you; she’s going to help you.Regarding the death of your uncle’s mother, if you didn’t know her, then your reaction was normal. It would be unusual to have strong emotions about losing someone with whom you had little to no connection.I hope you will utilize the therapeutic help that has been afforded to you.

[/INST]  Hello, and thank you for your question:It sounds like you are having a terrible time, and you may need to go to either a social skills group or find a therapist who specializes in relationship issues. Your problem seems to stem from your relationship with your parents, and that is where we learn to form intimate, meaningful relationships with peers.It is quite possible that you are not perceived the way that you wish. While you may be feeling snubbed by others, they may feel that they have tried to be friendly with you and misunderstood how you responded. That is not to say that it’s your fault, however.It’s simply that we can be viewed as needy, clingy, or even demanding when we are simply desperate to make friends. Please consider going to another therapist. The one you went to probably didn’t understand where you are coming from. Be completely honest about how it feels to be rejected or abandoned and try to figure out what is really going on at the root of all of this.  I can’t diagnose over the Internet, and no one should really try. All I can say is that you are struggling to be understood and loved and need to find a professional who can help.Please try to find a new therapist.

"<s>[INST] After years of trying to overcome my fear of opening up and being judged, I finally started therapy again last week. My problem is this: I just found out that the counseling service I’ve started going to is based out of a baptist church and my therapist is very clearly religious (shares religious posts on facebook [and yes, I checked her facebook page after the first appointment], bible verse plaques all over the office, etc.). [/INST]  You should discuss your concerns with your therapist. Be honest about your stance on religion. Honesty in therapy is paramount. You may be able to continue working with her despite her religious views. You won’t know until you discuss it with her.Having said that, it’s possible that her advice will be filtered through the lens of religion. Given that her counseling practice takes place in a church, that should not come as a surprise.The decision to keep a therapist should not hinge on the inconvenience of finding another one. It’s well worth your time and effort to find the right therapist. I usually recommend calling four to five therapists and speaking with them on the phone about the issues you would like help with and choosing the ones with whom you feel the most comfortable to meet in person. If you want good help, it often takes time and diligent research.You will either be okay with a religious therapist or you will not be okay with it. Gather more information, perhaps give it more time and see how you feel and then decide your next move. If you feel a little better after each session, that is a good sign. It will take more time and more sessions to know with certainty. Good luck and please take care. </s>"

Fortunately, you were able to escape before she became violent.Even if you tried to help, there’s little or nothing you could do. You’re not a mental health professional. If you tried speaking to her family, it might only make her angry. That might make you a target and she might try to hurt you.It is wise to stay away from her.

But this doesn’t feel like something I can tell them. I talk to myself all the time, but I “pretend” I’m a different person. My real name is Anne. But when I’m talking to myself or sometimes, someone else my name is a guy name and I’m gay. I’ve also had new thoughts recently, about taking a knife and cutting someones heart out. Or using a chainsaw. I get so angry I take my magic fairy wand and stab all my dolls naming them as my victims. I’m afraid not that I’ll actually kill or harm someone. But with all my rage, I’d be a really good partner for someone. I also have thoughts of younger boys. Anywhere from 10-17 years old. I get all hot and heated up and I can’t because I’m above the legal age. I started hearing and seeing things. I’m on xanax and abilify for my meds. I don’t take my abilify like I’m supposed too, just the xanax. But no one knows that. I started writing a catchy song about waking up in the morning and her wife finding her husband dead. I do play some violent video games but that’s definitely not it. Just like that 15 yr old girl who was on trial because she killed her neighbor just to know how it felt to kill, that’s how I feel but I wouldn’t even know where to start or begin…. What should I do? [/INST]  The best way to approach this problem is to be honest with the mental health professionals treating your condition. They can’t help you if they don’t know what is wrong. They are treating your symptoms based upon the information you provide. When you withhold important information about your psychological state of mind, they might treat the wrong symptoms and unknowingly make them worse.The fact that you have stopped taking your Abilify might be why you have developed new symptoms. It is important that you alert your treatment team about stopping your medication. There are occasions in which abruptly stopping medication can cause troublesome symptoms.Perhaps you are frightened or embarrassed to report your symptoms. You shouldn’t be. The sooner these issues can be addressed, the sooner your psychological health can be restored.The most responsible course of action is to report your symptoms immediately. Report everything that you have written about in your letter. If you feel as though you might harm yourself or someone else, go to emergency room or call 911. Emergency staff can keep you safe.

"<s>[INST] Hi! I’m an 18 year old girl and about a year ago I started researching different disorders and relating to symptoms.The thing is, every time I found I fit a diagnostic criteria for certain disorder, mostly cluster B personality disorders, instead of trying to deny the symptoms I started acting and thinking even more accordingly and felt proud of it.Now I’m getting a bit depressed because I feel like I have no idea who I actually am and what I actually think as I’m always trying to mold myself to fit the criteria.Acting disordered makes me feel good because it makes people notice my symptoms and it gives me reassurance, in a way. [/INST]  The practice you have described is unusual. It’s as though you are attempting to have a disorder in order to gain attention. Perhaps you feel that you have to fake symptoms in order to get those around you to notice you. I am wondering what symptoms you have faked, how you accomplish this and how it is received by others. In what ways do they respond to you and in what ways does their response make you feel better?Having a desire to be ill is a characteristic of people who have factitious disorder. Factitious disorder is a condition in which an individual person pretends as though he or she has a physical or mental illness. Individuals with this disorder have a strong desire to present themselves as being injured or ill. They will deliberately create a set of symptoms for the sole purpose of gaining attention and sympathy from others. They may create symptoms that do not exist or lie about their experiences.It’s important to note that I cannot know with certainty if you have factitious disorder or if you have any disorder. Diagnosing psychological conditions requires meeting in person with a mental health professional who conducts a thorough, psychosocial evaluation.In all likelihood, one’s attempting to appear sick is to gain attention. You may believe that it’s necessary. If that is the case, I take this as a sign of your unhappiness. My recommendation would be to consult a mental health professional who can explore why you feel the need to fake illnesses in order to gain attention. A therapist can teach you healthy coping mechanisms and problem-solving skills to replace your maladaptive behavior.You may want to ask your parents to assist you in finding a therapist or you can ask your primary care physician for a referral. Try several therapists until you find one with whom you’re comfortable. Therapy has helped many, many people and it can help you too. Please take care. </s>"

"<s>[INST] Hi, I’ve been with my boyfriend for a few months now and he has always had a problem with depression but at first I did think it was just his life as he almost died last year and his dad is ill and his mom is struggling in her life too, but as he’s spoken to me more I’ve come to realize that it’s deeper than his life and his thoughts are seriously negative and I struggle to help him. Whenever we see each other he’s always happy but I’m starting to wonder if he’s just hiding his true feelings. [/INST]  I’m sure this is very worrying. It’s painful to watch someone we love be in pain. Your boyfriend has been through a lot and it sounds like it’s not over yet with both parents struggling. I’m sorry he won’t take advantage of good help that is available. There is no shame in talking to a therapist. However you may care for him, you don’t have the training or experience to give him the help he may need to cope.On the other hand, you do have something no therapist has: You care about him personally and you can have good times with him. I suggest you not push him to talk about things he doesn’t want to share. Instead, focus on positive things. Get together with friends. Do things he likes to do. Do your best to sustain the happy times. Happiness and positive experiences are the best antidote to sadness and negativity.And, please, I hope you don’t let yourself get caught up in the drama of negativity. Negative drama only feeds negativity. Don’t beg him to share his secrets. Don’t constantly tell him how worried you are. Don’t try to “save” him. He doesn’t need a savior. He needs a friend. When he’s blue, suggest you go do something active, watch a comedy movie, or go hang out with friends doing something fun.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I was professionally diagnosed with ADHD and I’ve struggled with it since childhood. Later I was diagnosed with BPD and GAD, and a different doctor diagnosed BD2. I am certain about the BPD and ADHD, but I think I might actually have MPD (not GAD and BD2) and I’m concerned. I always hate telling my parents or my doctors about problems I think I might have for fear of looking dramatic or “wanting to have problems.” I fit every description in the DSM5, but when I think of MPD I immediately picture the movie Sybil and I know I am not nearly as severe as her. I would like to get help but like I said, I’m afraid it will be seen as one of my “attention seeking behaviors” (but I’m extremely aware of those, and I’ve been making them healthier behaviors as much as I’ve been able) I wouldn’t even know what to do if it were MPD, all the treatment options sound so scary and the thought of being labeled as one of the so-called “crazy” disorders is also scary. [/INST]  By MPD, I’m assuming you mean multiple personality disorder. MPD is now called dissociative identity disorder (DID). DID is a rare condition in which two or more distinct personalities are present. Each personality usually has distinctly different names, identities, temperaments, interaction styles, and so forth. The personalities alternate within an individual’s consciousness often causing significant memory lapses and frequent episodes of forgetting. The cause of DID is unknown but it is strongly associated with childhood trauma and abuse.It is important to remember that the movie Sybil was a dramatized production. It may not be an accurate portrayal of DID and should not serve as the basis for diagnosis. In fact, there’s controversy over the case. Sybil’s real name is Shirley Ardell Mason. Ms. Mason’s psychiatrist, Dr. Wilbur, did not write about this unique case in a scientific journal. Instead she hired a writer and the story was ultimately made into a movie.A psychiatrist who treated Ms. Mason, while Dr. Wilbur was out of town, did not think Ms. Mason had multiple personality disorder. He described her as “hysterical.” A psychologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, listened to the taped recordings of the therapeutic sessions between Ms. Mason and her psychiatrist and concluded that “it is clear from Wilbur’s own words that she was not exploring the truth but rather planting the truth as she wanted it to be.” You can read more about the case, and its skeptics, in this New York Times article.Nothing you’ve written in this letter would suggest that you have DID, however if you believe it is a possibility, then you should discuss it with a mental health professional. He or she would be in the best position to determine if you have the disorder.Even though cases do exist, I suspect that the majority of clinicians have never come across anyone with DID. That’s because people who have DID probably don’t realize they have it and thus don’t seek help from a professional. You might try consulting a DID or a trauma specialist, if one is available in your community. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi, this is Malana ane im 15.. i have Trichotillomania and ive pulled from basically everywhere possible. My common spots are scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, and pubic area. My eyelashes are gone and the majority of my eyebrows are gone too. I have two bald spots on my head also. Ive been trying to find some sort of inpatient rehab or treatment center for trichotillomania or impulse control disorders and im having a hard time finding any. Im afraid if i dont get the help now then im going to end up worse with no hair on my head bc of the pulling.. i need help and im not sure what to do. Ive tried many things like medication and a psyciatrist.. but its not working. The medication only helps with my depression.. if u can, id really appreciate it if you could help me by finding a rehab center or treatment center that could help me.. anything that can help. Thank you. [/INST]  Hello Malana. I am sorry but I don’t know of a specific clinic in your area that I could refer you to. Clicking on the “find help” tab at the top of this page might help you locate a treatment center close by that specializes in anxiety disorders. I would recommend reviewing therapists’ profiles on the Psychology Today website. I would recommend also reviewing and discussing that information with your parents. They could assist you in this process.You can also try performing an Internet search using the keywords “trichotillomania treatment” and the name of your town. Websites containing information about trichotillomania may also be a helpful source of information. Try these two: The Trichotillomania Learning Center and The OCD Center of Los Angeles. Psych Central has a trichotillomania and OCD support group that you may also want to join.Other people have found it helpful to call the local health department to inquire about the treatment centers in their community. Also, if there is a telephone number on the back of your insurance card, a customer service representative may be able to assist you in locating a specialized treatment center.You mentioned that you have been to a psychiatrist and that you have tried medication. Have you tried speaking to your psychiatrist about what other options are available or if he or she can refer you to a therapist? If you have not had this conversation with your psychiatrist, you should.It seems as though you are trying very hard to seek the proper help for your condition. I commend you for your efforts. I hope you are able get the help that you desire. If you have additional questions please do not hesitate to write again. I will be glad to assist you in any way that I can. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  I have been seeing a married man for almost 2 months now. We work together and have been friends for two years. He and his wife are no longer happy together, but neither of them want to be alone. We recently have gotten very serious and he has decided that he is going to move out of his home and into an apartment. During this time we want to try to see if our relationship is really love or simply lust. I understand that by doing this I am hurting his wife and I don’t want to hurt anyone, it’s not who I am, but I’ve never felt this way about someone before. [/INST]  There’s a difference between lying and keeping your personal life private. But I don’t think that’s the real question here. The reason you are feeling so anxious about sharing your relationship with your family is that you know in your heart that this situation isn’t going to end up anything but bad. You are with a guy who is cheating! You know that there is something wrong with a guy who will cheat rather than deal with his marriage honorably. That means seeking some counseling or separating cleanly, not sliding into a relationship on the sly with a younger woman. Further, you are violating your own values. You say you aren’t the kind of person to hurt someone else but you are doing exactly that.An important part of being an adult is being able to make good choices in spite of our feelings. Little kids go after what they want because they feel like it or because it feels good. Adults are able to delay gratification in order to meet longer-term goals.If this guy truly loves you, he’ll resolve things with his wife and do some personal work to learn from a breakup before he asks you to move in with him. If you love yourself, you will take a huge step back. Are you really willing to betray your own values in order to be with a man who isn’t man enough to deal with things in a mature way? Think about it.I wish you well.  </s>"

Well through my whole time being pregnet I’m 23 week along now and all my mom do is talk bad about my boyfriend and I’m crying all the time and so stressed about things. Well I really want to move back to be with him and have are family together just me him and baby cause he want the baby in his life and I want to be with him but my mom dose not agree with it at all and she don’t want me going she says how much I’m hurtting her but she is hurtting me to and I know it’s the right thing to do for baby so she can have her father in her life but I have no way to get my mom to understand what I wanna do an I’m not trying to hurt her by leaving but u have to do what’s best for baby. [/INST]  You’re 17, pregnant and probably scared. You’ve made an adult decision to be a mother. Now you have to make adult decisions about how you will live your life.My guess is that your mom is both angry with you and worried about the future. From her point of view, your boyfriend is in no position to be a father. He apparently doesn’t have enough of a job to rent an apartment and support you and the coming baby. That would worry any mom. All you can see is your love for your boyfriend. Your mom is looking at whether he is prepared to take on the responsibilities of being a husband and father. Apparently she doesn’t think he makes the grade. She may even be right.It’s a great distraction for you and your mother to fight with each other. I suggest you stop arguiing and start talking about whether you are really ready to be a mom, whether you can support a child, and whether your boyfriend can be a real partner in doing so. If so, there is nothing to argue about. You and your boyfriend should get jobs, get married, and start your own life. If you are somehow expecting your mother to be your backup, think again. She has already raised her children and may not be at all happy to raise yours. If that’s the case, think about the adoption option. Sometimes the way to love a child is to make sure she has parents who can raise her well.I wish you all well in this difficult situation.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m a 15 year old girl. for several years ive been having suicidal and paranoid thoughts. ive have multiple panic and anxiety attacks (at least once a week from mild to intense) and sometimes feel like im floating out of my body, not recognizing myself or other people. My family is caring but for some reason I remember them hurting me and lying to me. I hallucinated when I was younger of scary things, and I’ve always believed in things like my friend being a werewolf, that i have mind control, that people know things i dont and are targeting me. I often get selfish and defensive, i lie excessively and have a very inconsistent personality. I’m also afraid of relationships and have a lot of trouble expressing my emotions (this was more recently i used to be great at it). I have ADD but was never diagnosed with anything else, im suspecting i had bipolar symptoms before(i slept 2-3 hours and was eccentric. then heavily depressed). and i believe people send me hidden messages in their speech, im an artist and i can emerse myself in a nonexistant world, like i dont belong here and that killing myself will lead me to that prettier world. i do self doubt or try to ignore my thoughts but theyre still there. i get violent and jittery impulses, think about killing and torturing people like its nothing, and i get all excited and giggly. I have a nagging thought process that criticises me and other people. I try to remain honest with myself and laugh off any form of betrayal or oversensitivity. I interpret things to the extreme, sometimes unrealistic but i cant help buying in to it. I believe my father wants to kill me and my mother, i believe my sister is jealous i get more time with my mom, and i hate being happy. Whenever i get happy i need to remind myself i dont deserve to feel that or that its all fake and none if it will last. I self harm. My grades are poor and I prepare to commit suicide within the next three years, or maybe next year, or before college. I dont want to hurt my mother just in case she really does love me. I believe everyone will leave me and have isolated myself. Everything makes me cry. Help. [/INST]  I’m sorry this is happening to you. The good news is that there are treatments for your symptoms. The key to seeking help is to make the people in your life aware that something is wrong. It’s not clear from your letter that you have told your parents what’s wrong or that you have asked them to assist you in seeking help.If you don’t think you can go to your family then contact a trusted school faculty member or guidance counselor. They will immediately begin to determine what type of help you need and assist you in getting it. Once you begin treatment, your symptoms will begin to diminish and have less control over your life. With enough treatment, they can be effectively erased. I hope that you will take the next steps and ask for help.I’m especially concerned because you are contemplating suicide. All of the problems that you have written about are treatable with counseling and medication. When people consider suicide, it’s usually because they are suffering and don’t know how else to make their pain stop. Treatment is the solution. It will help you to experience joy instead of sadness, pleasure instead of pain. If you are considering suicide, contact emergency services and they will protect you. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I do not know if I should keep seeing my therapist. I’m a lesbian as is my therapist. I’m in a very happy long-term committed relationship, but I have problems having relationships with other women because romantic feelings often arise, and I don’t know how to handle them. This is one of the reasons I’m seeing this therapist–to work this out. [/INST]  Your thoughtful and detailed question opens the portal to the dynamics of therapy. It is always difficult to have clear–cut answers and decisions. There are many different therapeutic approaches and avenues of healing that take very different paths, and the ethical guidelines are designed to help manage the parameters that therapists operate within.The clarity of the boundaries in the relationship as it is being discussed is certainly an important feature of a healthy therapeutic connection. At the core of most successful psychotherapies is the relationship between the therapist and the client. The concern always is the balance and limits of the relationship that need to be respected.I would recommend three things: First, keep talking about this with your therapist. This will keep the issue on the front burner. Iinclude in your discussion that you have even questioned the degree to which she can maintain the boundary. Talk to her about the fact you are considering ending therapy because of these feelings. A therapist with 30 years of experience is likely to have traveled this road with others and should be able to navigate this with you.Second, I would consider joining a group not run by your therapist. A dynamic group will allow your relational dynamics to be more fully explored with others under the guidance of another therapist. This will help keep the perspective on your continued growth and well-being.Finally, keep talking about this and don’t feel like you have to keep your concerns and feelings a secret. Thinking that you cannot talk about this would be something you want to monitor and guard against.As with any human relationship open communication is essential. I applaud the fact that you have written this letter and want to keep your therapy going in the right direction. This now involves you speaking up and bringing the issue into the therapeutic relationship itself. If you feel the therapist isn’t able to manage this then you may have to move on. But this can also be an opportunity for growth, clarity and individuation.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] when i was 11, i was molested by my step father. or at least thats what i remember. i told a teacher and we went through this whole trial. and my mom was so depressed and under so much stress that she almost overdosed on pills and slit her wrists. during this time i was diagnosed DID, or dissociative identity disorder. i changed my story and cleared my step father. when i was 13, i was admitted into an in-patient hospital because of a suicide attempt and i was later diagnosed bipolar 1. my mother lived with me for 3 years before i moved to atlanta with my father after attending an out-patient program for 4 months after they told me i should get out of my house away from my step-father. [/INST]  It’s not surprising to me that you are having trouble sorting out the truth. You are under enormous external pressure. Your mom’s suicide attempt in the wake of your disclosure scared you. Your family thinks you are a liar. Your father keeps telling you you “ruined” the family. You want to be with your mother. Meanwhile, you are also struggling with the internal pressure of either coming to terms with a trauma or a mental illness. It makes sense to me that you keep moving back and forth between believing it happened and thinking it didn’t. You are responding to those conflicting pressures.You’re now in a bind. If it did happen, you have to come to terms with having been molested by someone who was supposed to love and protect you. If it didn’t, you have to deal with whatever motivated you to lie. Neither “truth” is comfortable, so you stay stuck.I can’t help you determine the truth on the basis of a letter. The most important thing you told me is that you aren’t talking with the person who can. Counselors who specialize in PTSD are usually well trained in how to help someone who is struggling as you are. I have a guess that you aren’t doing your therapeutic work because you are afraid of what you’ll find out. That may be just the place to start with your therapist.Your therapist can’t help you out of the bind unless you get invested in doing your therapy. Please give your therapist a chance. You really don’t have to go through life suffering like this.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] So for at least a year I’ve had many situations where I feel for instance that cameras are hidden all around my house and that people are watching and listening to me. While I feel like that I try to tell myself that that’s probably not happening (because I have looked and not found any cameras) but I still feel like it is. (I have thoughts like that at least once a day.) another example of what is happening is I have a feeling most of my friends are secretly trying to hurt me and my reputation when that doesn’t make sense. I have tried to confront my friends, they denied it but a part of me thinks if they actually are conspiring against me then that is exactly what they would say. Something else that might be related (I’m not sure) is that I don’t really speak to anyone at school after I confronted my friends (I used to speak to people) I am just not very interested in talking to people who are out to get me. Do you think what I am experiencing are delusions or just a normal bit of paranoia? *note* i have done some evaluation for schizophrenia and am not schizophrenic. [/INST]  Delusions and paranoia go hand-in-hand. It’s concerning that you believe in things that seem to be untrue. As you noted, you checked for cameras and did not find any, but it didn’t ease your fears. It should have. Feeling that your house is bugged and that your friends are conspiring against you are symptoms associated with several types of mental illnesses.You wrote that you have “done some evaluation for schizophrenia” but didn’t elaborate. If you are referring to self-diagnosis, I would advise against it. If you haven’t been evaluated by a mental health professional, that should be your next step.It’s important that you consult a mental health professional. Your symptoms could worsen if left untreated. The good news is that they are treatable with both medication and therapy. Discuss your options with your parents and ask them to take you for help. Treatment will help you feel better. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] About 3 years ago it all started with a full blown panic attack ! At the first time i didn’t know what was happening to me so I drove to the emergency room. They told me that I was ok and it was due to stress.It was hard for me to believe it. I’m a mom of two beautiful little children (2 and 4) and yes I causes stress sometimes but I just could not believe that stress can cause something like that. In a short time I experienced everything from depersonalisation to derealization and even more. At first I thought I might have a brain tumour, or a stroke and I feard that I might have something with the heart. When the docs told me that I was ok, I believed them and my fears went away. But not the dp. This feelings made me think that I could be a danger for my kids and that I could harm them because it felt like I will lose touch with reality. I did a lot of Google research what was probably the worst thing I could do ! My intense fear of becoming schizophrenic was born!

"<s>[INST] I have another voice in my head. I can remember having it as far back as 14 years old, after a traumatic event where my friends were very mean to me. Ever since I have had this head inside my mind. It isn’t an outside voice, I know it is in my head, it is also my own voice. However they are not my thoughts. [/INST]  I believe that you are referring to your inner, conscious voice. We all have an inner, conscious voice. It may be our intuition or a running stream of consciousness. It’s normal to hear an inner voice.Your inner voice is filled with negativity. People with low self-esteem and feelings of low self-worth describe their inner voices as being negative. People with depression also describe experiencing a great deal of negative self-talk. They seem to interpret all of their experiences as being negative.Now that you are aware of your negative self-talk, you can attempt to challenge the validity of your thoughts. Negative self-talk tends to be inaccurate and exaggerated.For instance, your inner voice says that your friends “hate you” but what evidence do you have to support that belief? I suspect that there is little or no evidence to support your belief. Your boyfriend has been with you for four years yet you believe he doesn’t love you. If that’s the case, then why hasn’t he ended the relationship?Your trust issues may sabotage the relationship and thus you should consider psychotherapy. Depression, negative self-talk, feelings of low self-worth, and relationship issues are some of the most common reasons people enter therapy. I hope that you will consider my advice.

"<s>[INST] current_problem: I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost three years. He’s my best friend and the only guy I’ve ever loved. I’m pretty high-maintenance (and some might say immature) and when we first started dating, he won me over by doting on me and being very attentive with lots of phone calls, IMs, and e-mails, thoughtful little gifts, shopping trips, etc. Every time we were both online, he would be sure to send me an IM, even if he couldn’t talk, just to tell me he loved me. [/INST] Yes. You are being rediculous. The man talks to you a couple of times a day. Yes. You have unreasonable expectations. The way people behave at the beginning, intoxicating, where have you been all my life part of a relationship is different from the way people treat each other when they settle into a lasting relationship. In good relationships, people normally go from being “crazy in love” to being loving and steady.Although I understand why you might miss the intensity of the early days, that kind of romancing generally isn’t what happens over the long term — except in sweet moments. Sadly, by being so constantly demanding, you aren’t giving your boyfriend a chance to give you those random, special I love yous. From his point of view, anything he does now looks like he is responding to your demands instead of responding to his own heart.Rather than trying to figure out how to “get what you need” from your boyfriend, you would probably do better to figure out how to not be so needy. You must be pretty amazing for your boyfriend to put up with your behavior so you do have something going for you. My best suggestion is that you find yourself a therapist to help sort this out before you lose what sounds like a very good thing.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: My second husband does not seem to like my son. My son is 16. We have been married 7 years. We have 2 sons together a 1 and 6 year old. He doesn’t say much to my son. He does not say many negative things to him, but he constantly complains to me. He complains over simple issues like he drank all the soda. [/INST]  For some people, the existence of the child from a former relationship is a constant reminder that their partner once had another lover and another life. They would like to erase that past but can’t due to the presence of the child. On a more primitive level, male animals often won’t accept the offspring of other males and drive them out of the herd in an instinctive effort to only pass on their own bloodline.People can and do get past that primitive behavior and open their hearts and minds to children who are not their own biological kids. All this is a long way around to saying that I think that the problem here is that your husband hasn’t adopted your son. He may not be aware of it, but his behavior seems to show that he’s trying to drive him from the herd. Of course your son knows it and is hurt by it.Your husband needs help understanding the need for an “adoption” to take place. I’m not talking about a legal adoption. Your son does have an involved biological dad. But there is room for the boy to have two men in his life who care about him, teach him, and help him develop into all he can be.Rather than be angry at your husband, try to have a conversation with him about what it is that gets in his way of being a positive role model and caring adult in your son’s life. Is there something you or your ex is doing that is an obstacle? Has he really thought about his role as being important to the boy’s self-esteem and growth? Has he embraced the fact that the boy is related to him by blood in that he is his sons’ brother?If that conversation becomes too difficult, I hope you will try some couples counseling before you visit a lawyer. This is not an uncommon problem. It can usually be addressed so that all relationships in the family improve.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am supposedly starting college in august after 2 years of going through financial aid hell. I had to get a job straight after high school and I have saved up my money. I’ve never really been one to make friends; I had maybe a small group of people I talked to in high school, but I’ve always sat alone. Unfortunately for me, everyone left high school and went off to enjoy their lives in college while I was stuck working and not living the college life I wanted. I began to cut myself off from the world and burned all my bridges. [/INST]  First – the good news: Colleges these days are full of non-traditional students, people who didn’t go to college straight out of high school. Due to the state of the economy, lots of people take time out to work, to go to a gap year program, or do volunteer work so they can get some experience before starting school. You are not that much older than the norm anyway.College isn’t like high school. The social rules are different. People do form friend groups but those groups usually aren’t closed like high school cliques. You will have a whole new universe of people to choose from. It’s a great place to start over. Give your classmates and yourself a chance.As you so clearly articulated, the solution to your problem lies with you.

"<s>[INST] As it turns out I have social anxiety and don’t know who I am. I’ve lived a sheltered life, homeschool and had my Mom who is not divorced from my Dad follow me cross country to undergrad who I felt I had to constantly support. [/INST]  I am glad you are receiving help. It is the right way to approach this situation. You recognized that you were depressed and appropriately sought help.However, if you are correct in quoting your therapist, there may be a problem. No mental health professional should ever suggest suicide as a potential option, especially to a client who has considered “jumping off bridges.” Therapists in the United States are legally bound to report the suicidal behavior of their clients. It would be both unethical and illegal for a therapist to suggest suicide to their clients.Perhaps there was a misunderstanding or a miscommunication. I would recommend asking your therapist directly if that is what she said. If you’re certain that is what she said, then it would be in your best interest to seek treatment from a different therapist.Not all therapists with the same degree are equally skilled. Some are better than others. That should be common sense. Not all surgeons are equally skilled. When people look for a surgeon, they look for the best or the one who is recommended the most. Also, not all surgeons are best for every type of surgery. A heart surgeon would likely not be the best for knee surgery. All that is true for the surgeon is true for the therapist.Therapy is effective. Don’t hesitate to try another therapist and keep trying until you find the one that is best for you.A good therapist will help to make the proper adjustments in your life to bring you happiness. You need to find who you are and what is right for you. This is not abnormal. Perhaps you have lived your life so far attempting to achieve the goals and accept the behaviors and thoughts of your parents. What is right for them is unlikely to be right for you. What is right for your brother or sister is not likely to be right for you. You are unique. Your path is unique.I hope this problem is resolved expeditiously so that you can receive the happiness that you deserve. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m 15, and for almost a year now I’ve had this issue with girls around the age of 6 to 8. I find them extremely sexually arousing and I can’t help myself but thinking about them. I’ve had plenty of girlfriends my age, but this just seems different. I’m worried about how later in life, if this will go away or not. Even my little neighbor, who cant be even 10 yet, I have fantasies about taking advantage of her innocence into having sex. I know this is horrible, and I even feel guilty constantly, but I can’t seem to help it. Also, when I see an older woman, about 25, who is very good looking, I don’t find them sexually attracting at all, unless they have a very childish look and feel to them. Even my close friend, who has a sister in 8th grade, I cannot get over how attractive she is, and how much I wish I could have her. I hope that this site could give some useful advise, as I love what you do to help so many people. Thank you ahead of time, hope you get to read this and help me out. [/INST]  You have identified your attraction to children as a problem. I wholeheartedly concur. It is never appropriate to be attracted to young children. Young children are nonsexual beings. Having any sexual contact with a minor is inappropriate and illegal. Your sexual attraction to children is a problem and the sooner it can be dealt with the better.The clinical term associated with being attracted to prepubescent children is pedophilia. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) for mental health disorders it is considered a clinical disorder. Pedophilia can be diagnosed at the age of 16. Technically, an individual is only considered a pedophile if he or she has engaged in sexual activity with a prepubescent child. Based on your letter, you are attracted to prepubescent children but have not acted on your desires. Thus you would not be considered a true pedophile but without treatment you are at risk for pedophilia.Being attracted to prepubescent children is not part of normal sexual development. What is very positive and advantageous about your situation is it that you have identified it as a problem. Once a problem has been identified it can be treated. Treatment is highly recommended in this case. Below I explain why in greater detail.Sexual urges can be very strong. Generally, they do not simply go away. They can become stronger and more difficult to control. If your sexual urges were to become overwhelming, the risk is that you may victimize an innocent child. This would be an extremely tragic outcome. Not only would it be tragic for the victim and their family but also for the victimizer. Pedophiles are treated very harshly in our culture. If you were convicted of having sexual contact with minors, then you would most likely go to prison for many years — but it does not end there. Should you be released from prison, you would most likely have to register as a sex offender. Being a registered sex offender could significantly damage your life. Registered sex offenders are placed on lists throughout the United States. They are denied jobs and often not allowed to live in certain areas. If a sex offender moves into a neighborhood, in some states, he or she is mandated to go door-to-door announcing their sex offender status.In addition, having inappropriate sexual desires would inhibit your ability to have normal sexual relationships. As you can see, there are potentially very serious and life-altering consequences to ignoring this problem.It was very brave of you to write a letter but you need to take the next step and seek help. At this point nothing illegal has occurred. Everything in therapy remains confidential with very few exceptions (and this is not one of them). Going to counseling is the right way to handle this situation. Being proactive would prevent many future hardships. I wish you well. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I know the site has many articles on this but I feel like it may be different somehow. I have had homicidal thoughts from a young age, I am 14 now, but just about two months ago they started to become very common and sometimes intrusive, or at least more than before. I was hospitalized for suicide attempts and excessive self-harm in March so some people think this may be the cause of it. These thoughts are not disturbing to me, rather I enjoy them. I think of things like abusing people, what it would be like to drive something through someone’s skin, watching people bleed or beg. I have also been just grabbing different things when I am alone that seem sharp and just driving them into whatever material is near me. It gives me an adrenaline rush similar to what I would experience whilst self-harming. I believe it could be due to withdrawal from self-harm so these thoughts are sort of like a substitute, but I might just be lying to myself. I have always experienced this but I thought it was something everyone had until recently so this makes me think that it might be less than what I am making it out to be for some reason. I feel as if I am lying to myself and I am only telling myself that I am homicidal just because. I do not trust others and I do not trust myself so a lot of the time I feel as if I am not mentally ill and only making it up. My therapist tells me this is not the case but I continue thinking I am only making things up. So I am conflicted as to whether these thoughts are real or not and I am just acting like it. When I was younger I used to only think about killing specific people, but it can be anyone now. Anyone that causes me the slightest bit of anger, my closest friends, my family (especially my mom, I have wanted her to die or for me to kill her since elementary), animals, teachers, or even strangers. My doctors and I believe that the situation is not urgent but it has been bothering me lately. I know that a lot of what I said is probably conflicting or something like that but I thought I would ask. [/INST] It would seem that there’s a correlation between your life problems and your homicidal thoughts. The fact that you attempted suicide and engage in excessive self-harm suggests an overall unhappiness in life. Happy people simply do not wish to die nor do they purposefully harm themselves. Whatever is causing your distress in life, is likely the reason behind both your suicidal and homicidal inclinations.One theory that may be relevant to your situation is that homicidal thoughts are caused (at least in part) from a feeling of powerlessness. As a teenager, you have very little power. You’re gaining it over time, but you’re still ruled by your parents. You mentioned that you specifically wished for your mother to be dead. Perhaps she is a major source of the problem.You didn’t mention this but perhaps you are a trauma survivor. It’s not uncommon for trauma survivors to experience homicidal thoughts. Homicidal thoughts, in this way, serve as a form of psychological compensation for feelings of powerlessness that you may have felt as a victim, or specifically as a victim of your mother.You theorized that the homicidal thoughts are serving as a “substitute” for your withdrawal from self-harm. That is a plausible explanation.It’s good that you are in therapy. It’s important that you continue sharing this information with your therapist. Hopefully, the two of you are working together to replace your negative, maladaptive behaviors with positive, healthy behaviors. With continued persistence and adherence to treatment, these problems will likely dissipate. If you feel that you might harm yourself or others, don’t hesitate to call emergency services. Good luck with your efforts. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  Ill try to make this short & sweet,the complications started w/ the untimely death of my son,as tragic as it was I was thankfully supported by numerous family and friends ,and would not have made it though all the hard decisions as well as the neccessary arrangments w/o the support of my daughter[his sister] my current wife who helped me raise them as their stepmother from a very early age was devastated. [/INST]  What a sad, sad story. I’m very sorry for the loss of your son. You did so much to save him but his problems were bigger than your love and help could conquer. And now you stand to lose your daughter and grandchild too. You must feel bereft.All I have to go on is your letter so my guess may be far from accurate but I’ll give it a try: It sounds like your kids only know how to be too close or too distant. It seems like maybe you are doing the same by rejecting friends. Consider, please, if you and your kids know how to be connected with those you care about but still be your own separate self. If I’m right that maybe you don’t know how, there are only two ways to be in relationship – close to the point of a kind of co-dependency or distant at the cost of the relationship.If that rings at all true, I suggest you find a trained family therapist (preferably someone who is familiar with Bowen’s work) to help you find new ways to relate to your daughter and your friends that allows for both individuality and connection. I realize this may sound like heady stuff. But I’ve seen families break apart when adult kids can’t find a way to be different from their parents (even a little) without going overboard or distancing. It’s as if they have to slam the door to feel like they have won their independence. Hurt parents then sometimes start slamming doors of their own and the breach gets wider and wider.You can’t make your daughter come back to you. But you can learn some new skills for inviting her back into the fold in a way that feels safe for her – and for you and your wife. I hope you will look for a therapist to give you the support and coaching you need. You’ve already lost so much. I think you deserve to give this a try.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I started dating someone who had been in prison for almost 10yrs of his life. He learned how to become very passive aggressive. We met up, broke up and months later he came back and I tried again. This time was better, but it all came out in the wash. So my Bday was recent, and he put no thought into my gift, so I was disappointed, but didn’t say so. We went out to eat and from start to finish he told me I deserve better he’s a loser etc. He did that a lot and I fed into it, but I didn’t feel like it that day. So the night sucked, the sex sucked, and the next morning he kissed me said he loved me and took all of his stuff and left. I put it off as a tantrum, and didn’t bother to speak to him. THen two days later, in my mailbox is a gps i have him as a gift. I didn’t ask for or want it back. Is he looking for a rise out of me? Will this be a continuous pattern of dropping hints on me, or could this really be the end. I don’t think we belong together, I don’t want him back, but I hate the lack of closure. And the immaturity of it all. In your opinion dealing with this kind of person, could this be the end, or just the beginning of more passive aggressive behavior. I know this seems more passive, but trust me, his anger gets so bad, silent treatment tantrums, etc that I wonder if it’s just lingering in the distance. I just need to know if I should be breathing a sigh of relief or holding my breath waiting for the next move he does. And of course, why. Why did he do this, why does he do this. I know prison gave him PICS, and he doesn’t even know what that means, but it obvious to me. (I am an RN who has worked in a lot of psych)But I just do not understand why no closure, and why I care so much. (I loved him and I think he loved me) Thanks! (From the USA) [/INST]   How much more closure do you need? He didn’t honor your birthday. Told you you deserve someone better, took all of his stuff, returned his gift. You say you don’t want him back and think this might be a ploy he is using to manipulate you. Breathe a sigh of relief and know that you have been asking the wrong questions. Instead of why he did and does these things — the better question is why you’ve tolerated this for so long already.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] There so much I can talk but I can’t as it would end up being a whole article, nor do I know how to explain everything. [/INST]  Four and one half months of doing something that you would rather not do or living somewhere you’d rather not live can feel like an eternity, but it won’t always be that way. Problems are a part of life. What most important is learning how to deal with them when they happen.Counseling is not a waste of time or money. It’s exactly what you need. It could help you to understand that your circumstances are temporary. It could also help you develop coping skills for dealing with stress.When people are stressed, they can develop a negative view of the world. They tend to only see negative outcomes or possibilities. They fail to see that there are potentially good outcomes in the future. This is why counseling is so important. Counselors assist their clients in having a more balanced and realistic view of the world.Don’t give up on counseling and make it your priority to get an appointment as soon as possible. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I am having a hard time convincing my boyfriend that his kids and my kids need positive feedback, encouragement and praise for things that they do successfully in their lives. I am aware of the phenomenon of overpraise or praise for things that don’t really warrant praise (like obeying the laws of gravity). That’s not my question. [/INST]  I suspect you already know the answer. You are looking for an authority to back you up. My research and experience put me squarely in your corner. Children need encouragement like plants need the sun. You are correct, that overpraise can spoil kids. But encouragement while they are learning and acknowledgment of growing skills have been well-documented as essential to good teaching. Catching kids doing right is far more powerful and valuable to their developing sense of appropriate behavior than catching them doing wrong.Kids also need affection and nonverbal gestures of approval in order to feel like they matter. Even monkeys provide their young with hugs and stroking and grooming. When deprived of physical affection, baby monkeys fail to thrive. Children are no different. If they don’t get enough physical attention, warmth and bonding, they are at risk of developing Reactive Attachment Disorder.I’m concerned that the two of you are in this debate at all. I doubt very much that words from an “expert” will persuade your partner to do things differently. We need to understand why he worries that being warm and loving and encouraging will be detrimental to the children. Was he deprived of loving care as a child? Does seeing the warmth you offer to children pick at an old emotional wound? Does he think that there isn’t enough love available for him if you attend to the children’s emotional needs? Has something happened that has put you on opposite sides rather on the same team? Getting to the bottom of the issue is at least as important as deciding who is “right”.If you find that the two of you can’t talk reasonably and sensitively about these issues, please consider seeing a therapist to help resolve the conflict. The children deserve loving parents. The two of you deserve to be out of the fight so you can take good care of the children you love.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.:  I’m not sure if I have D.I.D. or not. Most of the time I feel like I’m in a VR headset and that can lead to panic attacks. sometimes I see myself through a security camera almost. I have been hearing different voices and sometimes I don’t know where I am or who I’m with. I’ve seen my handwriting change multiple times while I’m writing. [/INST] Thank you for writing. I don’t know if you have D.I.D. I do know that you need to see someone who can help.Your grandparents are correct that nervousness is part of life at times, but what you are describing isn’t the same as garden variety teen nervousness.Please listen to my voice instead of the voices in your head. Do talk to your grandparents about getting some therapy for you. Reassure them that you aren’t looking for years and years of talking to someone — which is a common misperception of therapy and may be their worry. Instead, tell them that you are so upset so often that you just want an evaluation to help you understand what is going on. If there is a diagnosis like D.I.D., the therapist will help you explain what you need to your grandparents.Please follow through. This problem isn’t likely to go away by itself.I wish you well, </s>"
"<s>[INST] What’s wrong with me?! Agh I need help! I can’t sleep! I keep hearing voices and seeing dead people! I saw my sister dead in the fireplace! UGH I don’t know what to do! This happens nightly! Should I tell my mom what is happening?! WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME AND WHAT DO I DO?!!! Do I have schizophrenia or something?! I am not on drugs, nor do I drink, I am 12!!! [/INST]  Only an in-person evaluation could determine if you have schizophrenia or any other mental health disorder. If you are hearing voices and having hallucinations then you need to be evaluated as soon as possible. Schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders may be the cause of the voices and visions but these disorders are rare in children. There are other possibilities. Please report your experiences to your parents immediately. They need to know that you are having such experiences. If you don’t report this information to them, then they will be unable to help you. If reporting this information to your parents is not an option, then report it to another trusted adult such as a trusted family member, school guidance counselor, nurse, principal, teacher, clergyman, etc. The most important aspect of this issue is that you seek help and be evaluated.On rare occasions, individuals report hearing voices or “seeing dead people” and believe that they have psychic or mediumship abilities. There is a television show devoted entirely to this topic called Psychic Kids. I am in no way suggesting that you are psychic or that what you are experiencing is supernatural in nature. I am simply observant of the fact that individuals who claim to be psychic or to have mediumship abilities often claim to “see dead people.”The best way to handle the situation is to be evaluated by a mental health professional. It is important to determine what is causing you to have such frightening experiences and to find a way to decrease or eliminate the voices and hallucinations. Delusions and hallucinations can also be caused by medical problems and this is why it is so important that you receive an evaluation. Speak to your parents immediately. I hope you are able to get the help that you need. Please take care. I wish you well. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I know I am very young, but I feel so hopeless, out of control, and desperate that this was my last resort. I have come to realize that I have depression. One of my family members suffers with Bipolar disorder and depression and is currently on medications to keep them under control. I hate myself. Although people would specify me as “popular” in school, I feel like a loser. All my popular friends could EASILY live without me so what is my point in this world? I used to have one very good best friend, but she ditched me for someone else. We stay on speaking terms, but hang out rarely. Since summer has started, I’ve completely isolated myself and spent all my time alone in my room on the computer. I’ve began to obsessively exercise and become obsessed with counting calories. I’m at a normal weight now (5’5 and 114 pounds) but I look so fat that I’m surprised I’m even a normal weight. I still eat, but I only eat half of what I used to and only healthy foods. I exercise SO much. But there is one thing that keeps me going. My hope that someday this will get better. You see, I went to a performing arts high school camp where I was completely accepted for who I was. I made friends instantly, but the camp was over in 2 weeks and we all had to depart. The only thing to keep me going is the hope that in 2 years when I audition for that performing arts school is that I will make it in. I’ve made friends with all the teachers and am currently taking the ADVANCED ballet and modern classes (I’m going into seventh grade and am taking a class with college students). I really want to be a dancer. I just love how I feel when I’m there. I feel like I belong, like I’m part of a family. Everyone is accepted and loved. I just LOVE that feeling! The school is full of talented people, and I’m afraid that if I’m not skinny enough I cannot make it in. I also just want to stand out. My school now is HUGE like GINORMOUS! No one really stands out unless they are massively popular. In this school, everyone stands out in their own way. I just want this so bad, and it’s the drive to keep me going. But I feel like if I’m fat I can’t do it. I feel like I NEED to continue this diet and exercise regimen for an entire 2 YEARS before I make it in (NO DESSERTS, NO WHITE BREAD, ONLY SMALL PORTIONS OF RICE AND PASTA, ABSOLUTELY NO CANDY, AND NO EATING OUT). But I know that’s impossible to keep it going that long, but I just need to do it. I feel like I can’t, but I really want to. How can I cope with being extremely pressured to be skinny, with my depression and isolation, and with my friend problems? Please please please please help me. i’m desperate. [/INST]  The pressure you feel to be thin is a major concern. It is driving your obsession with being thin. It is an unhealthy obsession. In your mind, you “need” to do it. You have given yourself no choice. Your ability to limit your weight has become paramount.In addition, your body, its size and shape, has become your primary vehicle for success in life. A thin body, in your mind, has become the one and only pathway to popularity, attention, belonging, and to professional dancing. It is everything. The pressure you feel to be thin only makes sense in the context that you have placed on the importance of body size.You wrote that you are desperate. I can understand why. All of your hopes and dreams depend on your ability to limit the size of your body. The idea that being thin is the key to your happiness is an illusion. For those who believe this illusion, no amount of weight loss is ever enough. More is always better even when it isn’t.This problem is further complicated by the fact that your view of your body is distorted. As you mentioned, you are a “normal” weight but continue to see yourself as “fat.” That one line from your letter to me, shows you are no longer able to see the reality of your appearance. If the scale and the charts show that you are a normal body weight, in the normal range, you can not appear to be fat, not to others, not to trained professionals. You can see yourself looking fat in the mirror but that is an illusion. Almost everyone with an eating disorder sees an illusion staring back at them in the mirror. A fat illusion.It is important to recognize the incorrectness of your thinking. If it continues, it can lead you down a dangerous road. Some individuals who feel extreme pressure to be thin ultimately develop eating disorders.My recommendation is to discuss this matter with your parents as soon as possible. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Ask your parents if they will take you to counseling. Counseling could help you to develop a healthier relationship with your body. It could also help you to manage your weight in a healthy, controlled manner and address your depression and feelings of isolation.Now is the time to seek help. You may or may not have an eating disorder. Counseling can eliminate the possibility or stop it before the problem becomes unmanageable. The “find help” tab at the top of this page can help you and your parents locate a therapist in your community. Please take care. </s>"

"<s>[INST] Hi All, [/INST] While there are many unknown variables that make this difficult to sort through, I admire the support, love, and thoughtfulness you and your partner are putting into trying to do the right thing for his daughter. The two of you working together to figure this out and be there together for her will mean more than any particular strategy for coping with this situation. That said, I think there are constant transitions a 4-year-old goes through with many steep learning curves. She is likely getting ready for preschool and learning more, and rather than fight the crying for mummy or dealing with “I don’t like crusts,” I’d redirect her. This is a method of acknowledging what she is saying as you help her get oriented to being with you.“I know you miss mummy and I think she would want you to have a good time while you are here—so lets do this….” Is a sample of this style of intervention.Alternately, “I don’t like crusts,” can be responded to with something like: “I’m glad you know what you like and what you don’t and are telling me. Let me show you how you can take the crusts off.” These strategies help her to acknowledge her feelings, while redirecting her to the loving and helpful situation you and your partner have for her.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My boyfriend and me have been dating for 9 months. He told me he doesn’t hide anything from me and he told me he would tell me if he was talking to another girl. The other day he left his phone in my room. So I went on to his messages and saw texts with a girl he used to like. I noticed He always texted her first and he put smiley faces. It was just a casual conversation. Also, I saw texts from a girl that was his good friend. He told me that they don’t talk anymore but I noticed he texted her saying like hey what’s up! And he knows I don’t like her. My bf doesn’t like someone I talk to so I told the boy I talk to that I respect my bf and won’t talk to him. I thought my bf would do the same. So I didn’t tell him I saw these texts for a couple days. Then I confronted him to see if he would tell the truth or have an excuse as usual. So the girl he was texting that he used to like is his sisters friend so he told me he just texted her for his sister. But in the texts I saw, they didn’t talk about his sister once. And with his friend, he said he texted her to annoy her so she would stay out of his life. Like c’mon that’s a lie. Then he admitted he just wanted to talk to her. He admitted he hid it from me I think cu he said “I didn’t tell you cuz I know you would get mad”. I don’t care that much if he talks to them once in a while but the fact that he said he wouldn’t hide anything from me and did is what bothers me. [/INST]  I would take this opportunity to explain how important it is for the trust between the two of you to have him honor his word. This means clarifying the current issue with some detail. As an example, your boyfriend might want to text others in messages and not feel he has to report to you on these incidental texts, or you might insist he not text old girlfriends. The gray area between the two on you needs to be discussed and made clear. Use the situation to advance the understanding of your expectations. Couples that evolve in this way are investing in their communication with each other – which is an investment that will be more valuable as time goes on.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"

My then husband and I were in the process of divorce. [/INST]  Because he is a philanderer. A man who will cheat on his wife — at least twice — is not a man you can expect to be faithful to you. He seems to like the “romance” and the secrecy of an affair but he doesn’t want there to be any consequences. Chances are that any woman who gets involved with him will end up deeply hurt and very disappointed.Your part in this is that you had an affair with a married man. I know you were feeling vulnerable at the time. I understand that it felt wonderful to feel wanted. But, from my point of view, there are no excuses for a woman to help another woman’s husband break his marriage vows. Send any man who gives you the “my wife and I are getting a divorce” line packing. Let him do the honorable thing and deal with his wife and his marriage first. If he does get his divorce, then and only then does it make sense to explore the relationship.You asked why his wife stays with him. That’s between the two of them. She has young children. Apparently she has made some difficult compromises in order to keep her marriage together, at least for now. Be grateful that she responded to you as she did.

Please gather up your courage and talk to your parents and to the school administration. You should not have to put up with this a minute longer. He shouldn’t sit next to you in school. He shouldn’t even be allowed in school until he gets some treatment for being a bully and a predator.

"<s>[INST] Hello, I’ll get straight to the point. I am obsessed with video games, internet and tv-shows and tv-sports. From the past couple of years, I feel I have lost my sense of emotion but, I entered a relationship a year ago. I dumped her 3 months ago, as I found her cheating on me. Now, I don’t have any, literally, any desires, needs or wants. I can’t seem to focus on things. My relationship brings me back some tough moments or makes me think how stupid I was. I start getting emotional when I think like that,so I tend to not think about. My friends have been great to support me. I dont understand myself neither my emotions nor my decisions. I have thought couple of times about ending my life but I am very lazy. These days, since I’m very lazy, I procrastinate and waste time a lot, and my mother is very much annoyed by me. Her reactions to my little mistakes make me very angry. Now, anyone who tries to morally correct me, I seem to get a grudge against them. I know its important to let go and move on, but I just cant seem to do anything properly. I have big ambitions but I’m uncertain that I’ll live up to them. My emotions swing drastically. I get annoyed super easily. I thought, I’d need some help, thus, I have come here. (age 15, from India) [/INST]  I’m sorry that you are going through this difficult time in life, but I am hopeful that you will pull through it and find new things to be joyful about. You are at a difficult age when your body, your friends, your emotions and your interests can all change dramatically. Have patience with yourself and with others during this time.As popular as electronic stimulation is these days (video games, internet, social media, and tv) they can be somewhat addictive, and most importantly, take us away from real relationships in real time. Limit time spent on these activities and force yourself to be with friends and family. Get involved in activities that require physical movement or that help give you a sense of purpose. And I’m sorry that your girlfriend cheated on you, but you can heal from that and find someone else special to care about.Finally, if you do these things and don’t begin feeling better soon, it may be time to speak to a mental health professional to help you pull out of this slump.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] We are adopting a little girl who has never had issues with peeing her pants before. The father found out he wasnt the real father and just gave her up. I am related by blood to the girl and she knows us. But she has been having “accidents” a lot. We went out of town for a week and she was great! But started back to school today and the teacher called and told me she peed again. [/INST]  I’m assuming that you’ve taken her to her pediatrician to make sure that she doesn’t have a physical issue. If you haven’t, please do. Not everything is psychological.If she is medically okay, then we look at psychological issues. Young children often regress when they are under stress. This little girl is dealing with rejection by her parents and a major change in her life. She may be trying to exert some control in her own life by trying to control her bladder. This is primitive behavior but not uncommon in stressed kids.It’s notable that she did okay when she was only with you. It may be that she is adjusting okay to her home situation but the stress of a new school, new kids in her life, and the expectations of school are just too much for her.I think you should start by just asking her. Tell her that sometimes kids go back to acting younger than they are when they are upset. Ask her how she feels about school. Are there any problems there you can help her with? Tell her you know it is hard on a kid when the grown ups are making all the decisions and she has so little say. But emphasize, as you already have, that you do love her and that you want to help her feel more comfortable.Don’t make a big issue of the wetting. Just quietly help her clean up and put the soiled clothes in the laundry. Tell her you know she’ll be able to be more grown up when she is ready. The less said, the better. Give this approach an honest try — perhaps a month or so. If it doesn’t work, I do suggest that you get a consultation with a family therapist to help you all make this transition.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi. I’m going to be 18 in a week, and… well, how do I start? I’ve been cutting (sometimes making myself bleed with scissors, nail files, plastic knives, safety pins, paper clips, etc.) since I was 12. And it’s sort of been going on intermittently since then. I have multiple diseases, and I’m pretty sure I have depression, although I’m on Cymbalta now and that used to help. But I think family problems are getting too out of control now. Anyway, I want to tell my psychologist that I’m cutting, and I’m probably going to start again because of things going on, but I don’t want him to tell anyone. I have an appointment three days before I turn 18. If I tell him when I am 17, will he tell my parents? And if I wait until after I turn 18, will he not tell anyone? I’m not going to kill myself, and I am never in danger of dying. [/INST]  In all likelihood, your therapist would not inform your parents that you are cutting. Generally, therapists cannot reveal that type of information if the client has not given their permission to do so. If you had a definitive plan to end your life, your therapist is legally bound to inform the authorities and would likely tell your parents. In most cases, cutting is a form of self-harm or self-punishment and not an attempt to end one’s life. Most therapists understand the distinction.It will be difficult for your therapist to effectively help you if you don’t report the cutting behavior. I understand that you are worried about your parents finding out but it only prolongs your recovery. Therapy is confidential except in cases that involve serious threats of suicide or homicide. You could ask your therapist what type of information he or she would report to your parents.It’s important to tell your therapist and your prescribing physician that the Cymbalta is no longer working. The medication may need to be adjusted. The fact that you no longer believe that your medication is working might explain why your desire to cut has returned.An unfortunate number of people, especially young adults, engage in cutting and other self-harm behavior. It is dangerous and ineffective. Some report that it provides temporary relief but it never solves the problem. Cutting is a sign that an individual is suffering and a sign that he or she has not yet developed healthy emotional regulation skills. These skills can be learned if you utilize the therapy resources available to you. I hope you are able to receive the help that you desire.I wish you the best of luck. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have Bipolar Disorder and some anxiety issues that cause panic attacks when I get overwhelmed by people, noises, stress, worrying, etc. For some reason, I always think I am going to be harmed. When I was little I couldn’t watch the news because I would become upset and always think about the people who died. [/INST]  Hello and thank you for your question:It sounds like you are having an awful time, but there are a few different issues going on here and I will try to address them separately.First, you mention the fear of being harmed or killed. That’s a pretty common fear among adolescents, especially today (I will get back to this question below). You are a teenager now, so that would have made you about 8 years old when 9/11 happened, right?  You were old enough to understand that something awful was happening but not quite old enough to understand that the government and individuals were working extremely hard to protect us.We were all frightened, but it was especially necessary to assure our children that they were going to be OK, whether we as adults believed it or not. I saw dozens of children in my office back then, for this very reason. Doctors needed to help the families deal with the fear and to help calm their frightened children.Children should never watch the news. In fact, I often tell adults not to watch it, or at the very least not watch it at bedtime. Why? Because it never changes. Think about it: someone has been shot, there’s been an accident, somewhere there’s been bad weather, the government is trying to fix a problem, and some celebrity has done something stupid. Again.  Never changes.  Just the names and the locations. September 11th was actually an exception. In that case, I told people to stop watching the news 24/7, because the news kept repeating the same images all day long.There is nothing healthy on the news. Just bad stuff that causes fear and nightmares. I found that I never miss what is going on, even if I don’t see the news. Someone will always tell me what is new. It never fails.  So, first consider how much news you are watching now. Cut it by at least half. That includes the Internet.You also talk about being harmed or robbed. This often stems from a traumatic event which you fear will happen again, or, it can come from the overall feeling that you are not safe. Ask your parents to put a lock on the door that leads from the garage to the house. There should be one there in any case. Even the police would recommend that.I don’t know that this will help, but most robbers are not interested in hurting people. They only want to get in, take stuff and leave quickly. Killing is never part of the deal, and most are unarmed. That’s a well known fact. Invite the police to check your house for safety. They can tell you if you are generally safe or not.Don’t watch CSI, Law & Order, or any of those other gruesome shows that depict violence and gore. They aren’t good for you to watch. Those are fiction. You don’t need help creating scenes in your head. Don’t watch shows that are about true crime, either. They are only on TV because they were especially violent. Not good for you.Finally, you mention counting and sorting your food. This sort of behavior also comes from the fear of not being safe or in control. The more you count or check (or sort), the safer you think you will feel. Actually, it usually has the opposite effect. The more you count, the more unsure you are that you counted. Sound familiar?OK, here’s what I suggest after all of this. Talk with your psychiatrist about your fears and anxiety. Perhaps he can adjust your medications. Second, if you are not seeing a therapist who specializes in adolescent issues, find one and ask your parents to take you there. They can honestly give you strategies that will reduce your fear and counting and help you return to a normal life. Third, if you are not already keeping a journal, start one. Write when you are upset, scared or worried. Write when you are happy or sad. But write. Take it in to your doctor and show him passages if you like. But, don’t keep these fears inside. Most of them are pretty normal for your age group, but you might want some help from a professional to sort them out. You can go to our website Find A Therapist to locate one in your area.I hope this helps, </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in Singapore: Since I was 5, I have the thought that being the oldest sibling at home I need to put on a strong front in order for my mum to not worry about me or just people finding me weak. I don’t know if it’s because of my Father going to jail since I was young that caused it, but i always feel ashamed after crying in front on anyone and I hide all of my emotions except those positive ones. [/INST] I’m so glad you reached out to us. Yes, it may be that you learned at a young age not to make things “worse” for your mother by keeping your feelings to yourself. But that was a conclusion that was reached by a very little person. Little kids often don’t make wise decisions. You’ve now been living this way so long that it’s become a bad habit that is cutting you off from others and making you miserable.I hope you can find a counselor to talk to who can help you reevaluate the decision you made when you were so young. You can learn more appropriate ways to handle your feelings. You can learn ways to interact with others that allows them to see all of you, not just the side of you that is happy.If you can’t find a counselor, do consider joining a forum here at PsychCentral. People from all over the world give others support and advice.Do follow up. Your relationships with others won’t be healthy and happy until you do. You deserve to be able to experience and express all of your feelings.I wish you well. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I love my husband. I will start by saying this. When I first met him he was the most amazing man I’d ever met. Then I started seeing his anger. He never hits me; but there is emotional abuse. As far as us being in public or with my family he is not my husband. He puts on a fake faced as he hates himself. He has told me this. He does have some things that bother him from his past as well. When we talk intimately it is amazing. He loves me, our daughter and would do anything for us. When I tell him he needs to fix things he cries and apologizes and does for what used to be a month or so and now is about a week or less. He he is so easily irritated. He snaps in a second. He says mean and hurtful things about. Little things for example like me asking him a question about his day or something we are planning to do makes him insane sometimes. He is constantly being disrespectful and mean. He knows it really hurts me so he has tried to calm it down. So he no longer calls me derogatory names often. I also can see he is trying to be a good man. He got a job for the first time that lasted over 3 months. I know he cares or he wouldn’t try to improve. So these are positives. Now the negatives are he snaps over nothing, he is constantly berating me and basically emotionally abusing me. He can’t help but point out how stupid I am or any flaw I have. He has major anger issues which do NOT extend to violence, although he used to get into multiple physical fights with others, but he has made me question having him around my daughter. He swears at me in front of her. He has held her close and screamed in her face. She is only two and she is scared of her father. She doesn’t want to be around him and refuses to hug or kiss him. This hurts him so I try to facilitate her giving him affection because 1/2 of the time he is amazing, but she flat out doesn’t want it. To summarize he has extremely wonderful highs where he is amazing. He is so easily angered that myself, his mom, his dad, his sister, and my daughter are walking on egg shells. He refuses to get help. What do I do. [/INST]  You are in a difficult situation. You love your husband. There are many positive qualities about him but also some negative qualities, namely the emotional abuse. You, in particular, are a target of his abuse, as is your daughter. Unfortunately, that will not likely change as long as he refuses to seek help.If he cannot change, cannot control his behavior and refuses to seek help then you have a difficult decision to make. Your options, as I see them, would include:1. staying in the marriage and tolerating the abuse; 2. giving him an ultimatum: agree to treatment or else a separation; or 3. consider terminating the relationship.Of the three, the second option might provide the necessary leverage to begin treatment.When a loved one refuses to seek help, and their behavior is negatively affecting others, it is often those who are being negatively affected who must act. That seems to be the unfortunate reality in this situation.I would highly recommend consulting a therapist. A therapist could offer a much-needed objective perspective into this situation. He or she could also gather detailed information about the history of the relationship, advise you about how to handle this problem and offer his or her support during this difficult time.The primary reason why I am recommending therapy is that you may be in denial about the full reality of your situation. Your love for your husband may be clouding your judgment. Your husband apparently cannot control his behavior and is abusive toward you and your daughter. His abuse is damaging. It is harming you, the relationship and your daughter. The proof is that your daughter is now frightened of your husband. In addition, you characterized your household as one in which all of the family members feel as though they have to “walk on egg shells” when he is present.There is no simple solution to this problem. That is why I hope that you will consider seeking professional help. Mental health professionals are trained to deal with these very problems. The find help tab, at the top of this page, can help you to locate a mental health professional in your community. I wish you and your family the best of luck. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m not sure if i have depression or anything like that. I’ve never been diagnosed. I’ve been having this issue for a while now and its getting more prominent as the days go by. I’ll be sitting and playing a video game or watching a movie to try and distract myself from myself but it seems to make it worse. I’ll be sitting and then i start hearing my own voice in my head but when it speaks, all it says to me is all the negative emotions that i feel. it tells me that i’m a loser, I’m lazy, and it asks me what am i doing, why do i bother to continue living. I’m worthless and nothing but a bother to my girlfriend. I know at this time I’m not the most active. I’m looking for a job at the moment and when the school year rolls around I’m going to be going back to school to get my life back on track. But anytime that i sit and try to do something a get overwhelming thoughts running through my head telling me things that i can’t shake. Its like my mind knows all my weak spots and aims for them. sometimes it asks me about my relationship with my fiance and says things like “you don’t really love her, you’re just using her, everything you say to her is a lie.” and i end up screaming back at it to shut up. I’m not very good with words so i’m sorry if this description isnt very good at describing. I’m very lost in my emotions and my thoughts and i would like any sort of help. Please, i need any kind of help. [/INST]  You did a fine job describing your experience. This certainly sounds like it may be depression. You didn’t mention what you meant by your life being off track. But you did indicate that you’re out of school, unemployed, and feeling generally worthless. It sounds to me like your self-esteem has taken a big hit.I agree with you. You need some help – more specific help than I can give you without talking to you to get a more complete picture of what is going on with you. There are medical problems that could be contributing to your symptoms as well as psychiatric ones. I urge you to talk frankly with your doctor. Inadequate sleep, recreational drugs, or alcohol abuse can contribute to these kinds of problems so be sure to share anyhing relevant in those respects. If you are medically fine, then ask for a referral to the local mental health clinic. If being unemployed also means that you have no health insurance, explore whether there are therapists in your area who work on a sliding fee scale. You at least want to get an accurate assessment and some recommendations for how to get some peace from all those negative words in your head.Please follow through. Nobody deserves to be mentally beaten up like this day after day.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My boyfriend thinks I am lying and hiding a deep dark secret. What he believes to be true is that I am having sexual relations with my father. This is absolutely false. He believes that he is right. He says he has enough evidence and proof that this is true and something that I have trained myself to play reverse psychology on people. I am appalled at the thought of this and the fact that my own boyfriend actually believes this to be true with his own eyes really infuriates me. [/INST]  The smartest thing you said is that you shouldn’t be involved with this guy. You’re right. Please listen to your wise self. You can’t argue or reason someone out of something that is so unreasonable. He is an insecure and manipulative guy who will never be satisfied with any answer you come up with. In the name of “helping” you, he always keeps the upper hand.Love is not enough of a reason to keep this relationship going. Whatever positive qualities he has, your boyfriend will never let you be happy. Staying with him will mean a lifetime of defending yourself.

"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I am a typical college student. In April of 2014, my boyfriend of 2 years broke up with me. I was devastated. I moved on, however, but I have been having some relationship issues now. I am unable to start a new relationship with another man because I am too needy and dependent. They say I am not ready for another relationship, but I feel as if I am. The guys I talk to feel as if I complain too much, and that I am more trouble than I am worth. How can I fix this? I would really like to be able to start a new relationship, but I just can’t seem to make it work. I feel as though something is terribly wrong with me. I am afraid I will never find anyone if I continue acting this way, but I don’t know how a “normal” college relationship is supposed to be. Any advice? [/INST]  The relationship you need to be working on right now is the relationship you have with yourself. You got together with your ex when you were only 16. You’ve never had the time and freedom to explore who you are independent of a man. It doesn’t surprise me that you come off as needy and dependent. It’s very possible you are looking for the guy to fill in the blanks of who you are.The healthiest relationships are made up of two people who are strong, capable people who like themselves because of the many ways they contribute to the general good in the world. They don’t look to a relationship to “complete” them. They are already complete and enjoy their own company. Such people look for an equal partner in life’s journey.At 18, you have lots of time to find a boyfriend. Drop the boyfriend search. Focus instead on making friends and on doing things that help you feel good about yourself. Join in on some of the many activities available on campus. Get involved in community service. Get engaged with your studies. Be the kind of student who asks interesting questions and helps a class be exciting. The romance will eventually naturally follow. If you want to find a healthy relationship, you have some personal work to do first.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S..: I come from a family with a mom who suffers from major depression and would purposely withhold affection so that I wouldn’t turn out gay. My dad was diagnosed schizotypal, and depressed. They were both addicts of drugs, alcohol, tabacco, and my dad was a sex addict. My father’s addictions ended up killing his liver and after spending eight years in and out of hospitals from the damage he’d done, he finally died when I was 15 years. I had a girlfriend whom I loved very quickly, then I would break up with her because I felt suffocated then I would love her again and want to get back together. We did this over and over until we got married at 21 years old. [/INST]  Although some of your behaviors meet the criteria for BPD, I doubt that is the problem. I could be wrong, of course. I have very limited information. But there are other factors that need to be considered as well: As the child of addicted parents, you have a history that may have left you ill-prepared for coping with life. You have also been in the military and served in Iraq. Many vets report similar thoughts and behaviors.For that reason, I urge you to seek out a therapist who has considerable experience with veterans. It may be that the therapists you’ve been seeing don’t have enough experience with returning soldiers. On the other hand, if they do have that experience, it may be a matter of therapist-client “fit.” It’s not at all unusual for a person to try therapy a number of times before finding a counselor he trusts and can talk to.That you are thinking about these things and looking for help tells me that you are ready to do some serious therapeutic work. Please don’t give up on finding the right counselor for you. If you haven’t already, contact your local VA for recommendations for therapists and a support group. You could also call the Army’s Wounded Soldier and Family Hotline at 1-800-984 8523 for guidance.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Lately I’ve been feeling Irritated all day, i strongly hate people, people I’ve never met. Sometimes because of how they look, sometimes because of how they act. I look at the world around me, and feel as though i will never be happy, because of the hate i am filled with. [/INST]  Hello and thank you for your question:It sounds as though you are having an awful time, but here’s what I was thinking when I read your note. You say that you were diagnosed with depression at an early age, and that you had some terribly angry periods growing up. You indicated that your anger is now under control, yet you describe yourself as hating nearly everyone and everything.If you have not had a physical recently, ask your parents to take you to your doctor so he can rule out anything physical that may be going on. Many things change during adolescence, and sometimes they are things that can be helped. For instance, if you are taking acne medications, they have been shown to cause or worsen depression and anger. Also, if you are doing any kind of street drugs or alcohol, they can worsen anger or depression as well.It is also possible that your depression medications (if you are taking any) are no longer working. The fact is, we can get to the point when they aren’t as effective, and that’s the time when our physicians need to know so they can make the appropriate adjustments. If you are not taking any meds, then you should probably get back on them. They really will help you bring your hatred under control and you can begin having a “normal” life again. That is not to say that much of anything is normal about adolescence. On the contrary, adolescence is about finding your identity in a herd of sheep, working to separate yourself from others, and moving toward adulthood.There is no period in your life that is much more painful. It’s a horrible time, when you aren’t quite sure who you are or what you want to be, but everyone else seems to be ok with themselves and their friends. Honestly? Most of them are feeling just as bad as you are. Trust me on this; I have worked with many, many teens and most of them are frustrated, angry, depressed and suffering in very similar ways that you are. It’s sad to say that normal adolescence is often painful, but here’s the good news: it will pass. You may never look back at this period in your life as great, but you may see, sometime down the road, that it was a necessary period of growth and adjustment.In the meantime, consider what I said about your medications, and also consider, if you could, seeing a therapist who specializes in working with teens. There are some great ones out there and he or she can make a huge difference in your life. You can locate one in your area at Find A Therapist.I hope this helps,  </s>"

I got pregnant with in a few months after we met and we decided to get married. I was a student and did not not have a job. [/INST]  I can’t tell you whether you should get a divorce on the basis of only a letter. I can sympathize with your pain and confusion. The situation you describe sounds awful. I’m guessing he is as miserable as you are. He can’t not know that you are turned off by him. It’s to both your credit that you have stayed together this long. I suspect it’s partly because neither one of you really wants your kids to be split between houses and partly because there are still memories of that intoxicating time when there was great sex and passion between you. Sex can be a powerful glue.My best advice is that the two of you should go to see a couples counselor. Counseling isn’t always to help a couple get back together. Sometimes it’s intended to help people learn from their experience and to pull apart in a way that takes care of everyone — you, your husband, and the kids. Even if you do divorce, you two will be co-parenting for years. If your children are to grow up emotionally healthy, you need to reclaim your respect for each other and to operate cooperatively. That alone is good enough reason to spend some time in a counselor’s office. Further, chances are the two of you will also learn things that will help you not make the same mistakes when you start looking for mates again.If he won’t go to see a counselor, please go yourself. You need help to either change this destructive situation or to get out of it.I wish you well.  </s>"

You took advantage of an opportunity to find out what you’re made of and you did it. You found work, managed to live in another culture, and survived a serious illness without the support of family and good friends. I would say that the experience has been an enormous success. You now know without a doubt that you can take care of yourself by yourself if you have to.But, here’s the thing: You don’t have to. It’s good to know that you can but you don’t have to keep doing it to again prove it to yourself or anyone else. As far as I’m concerned, there’s no shame in deciding that you’ve learned enough for now from the school of life and that it’s time to do something a little easier.The disturbance of sleep and eating patterns might be your unconscious prodding you to get up and go. If there is really nothing to keep you in Finland, perhaps it really is time to return to your own country, at least for an extended visit.

"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: I went to a party last night that I didn’t know anybody but my brother. I felt like such a loser cuz everyone was communicating and didn’t even notice I was there. Even when I was standing in a group of people this one guy was introducing his self and didn’t even acknowledge me, like I didn’t even exist. [/INST]  I don’t think it’s social anxiety. And I don’t think you couldn’t fit in. I do think you need to do some work on your social skills. Being comfortable interacting with other people is a learned skill. It’s easier for some people than for others, it’s true. Some people are just born extroverts. But the rest of us have to learn how to initiate and maintain conversations; how to enter into a situation where other people seem to know each other; and how to be at ease in a crowd.Instead of sitting all by yourself hoping for someone to notice, you could have joined a group and started acting interested in getting to know other people. Most people respond positively when someone starts showing interest by asking questions and listening attentively. Most people decide someone is interesting when that person is interested in them.Read up on communication and social skills. Talk to your brother about how to connect with his friends. Practice with your own friends and, especially, with friends of friends you meet. Practice does matter. With practice, you too will be able to be comfortable in settings where you don’t yet know another person there. Remember: Strangers are often friends you just haven’t met yet.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello. Due to obsessive compulsive disorder I have developed a new obsession that is causing me so much concern I am unable to think about anything else and in desperate need of some reassurance! Firstly I have suffered all my life with mental health problems. I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 7 then with OCD at the age of 13. The ocd symptoms were significantly reduced between the ages of 15 to 23 (last year) although in between this time I suffered significantly with depression, although extremely painful to me this was better than OCD. Unfortunately however the symptoms remerged late last year and have been chronic ever since. I am constantly looking for possible reasons for my problems and constantly undergoing countless amounts of treatments and therapy in the hope to finally put an end to all this. Unfortunately to no avail! My recent OCD obsession is a particularly scary one for me I’m seriously worried about developing serious mental illnesses in particular schizophrenia I have spent 2 days straight researching this when I came across the topic of age of the father and increased risk of mental illness. My dad was 44 when I was born and and according to recent studies and findings this doubles my changes of developing schizophrenia. To about 1 in 68 (I think) this worries me no end and I literally can not stop thinking about it. Especially as I am 24 and nearing the age where women tend to develop the illness. I’m basically just looking for some reassurance. Should I be overly concerned about this? I know I do not have the illness but I have convinced myself I will get it. I’m not sure if my mental problems I have experienced in my life so far are due to my fathers age at the time of my birth but if so my main question is if I am susceptible to mental illness does this therefore increase my risk even further when it comes to schizophrenia on top of the risk I already have due to my dad’s age?At the moment I am convinced that schizophrenia is going to affect me and I can honestly think of nothing worse. When I think about my fathers age and my history of mental illness i feel it is inevitable! Sorry this is so long winded I’m having trouble putting it into words but if you can offer any advise at all it will help me no end! Thank you so much. [/INST]  There is a small but negligible increase in your likelihood of developing schizophrenia because of your fathers age at the time of your birth. There is no known cause of schizophrenia. There are many theories about what causes schizophrenia but not one of them has been identified as the true cause. Many people believe that schizophrenia is a brain disease. It is also believed that environment and exposure to stress play instrumental roles in the development of schizophrenia.You have been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It is not uncommon for people with OCD to become fixated on, what many consider to be the most severe mental health disorder, schizophrenia.The best way to eliminate fear is to focus on reality. Relative to other mental health conditions, schizophrenia is rare. It is diagnosed in approximately 1 to 2% of the population. Thus, it’s statistically unlikely that you will develop the disorder, especially if you have no symptoms.If you’re not in treatment, you should be. OCD is highly treatable.

Once your OCD symptoms are under control, this fear will likely dissipate. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: Well, let me start off. I am a teen who loves my family, however I get very annoyed and angry in my mind at unintelligent, annoying, attention craving people. Whether I have problems with them or not, they annoy me. [/INST]  Yes, you have a disease. It’s called adolescence The teen years make most people uneasy in lots of ways for a time. Please understand that I’m not being dismissive or disrespectful. I understand completely that it is confusing and painful to be in turmoil about so many things. You are asking the big important questions about values, compassion, morality, and mortality. You’re trying to figure out who you are and what kind of person you want to be. None of that is easy. But fortunately, your mind and emotions will settle down over time.You will get through it faster if you start focusing on doing good things in the world for other people instead of thinking so much about whether there is something wrong with you. If you really want to get better, join a service club, do some volunteering, and look for opportunities to do random acts of kindness. Research shows that doing positive things at a ratio of 3 – 5 to 1 (3 – 5 positive things for every negative one) builds people’s self-esteem and has all kinds of positive benefits.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello there. So, I’ve recently made the acquaintance of a kid in my grade — a kid that most people avoid, because he is strange in an uncomfortable way. We really hit it off (I find that I end up relating to a lot of the things he says, or at least find them interesting), and while I only consider him a casual friend, he claims he is in love with me, and has started following me everywhere (missing class or staying late to do so), which is uncomfortable but essentially harmless. However, lately his conversations (which are always considering the philosophical or abstract) have turned increasingly violent and twisted, and his behavior, which has always been strange, increasingly erratic. I know for a fact that he has schizophrenia and other mental illness in his family, and he himself has experienced trauma throughout his childhood. It would be safe to say that he too suffers from some kind of mental imbalance. But, this alone is not what I worry about, as selfish as this is going to seem. What I worry about is his influence on my life and relationships with others. He makes others uncomfortable by bringing up dark or “taboo” subjects in casual conversation, either for the shock factor or because he’s genuinely interested, and high schoolers usually don’t like to indulge in such conversation. His habit of following me around frightens my friends, who consider him a time-bomb of sorts, and often gets me in trouble with teachers. I genuinely enjoy his company, for the most part, but I worry. I’m told that he’s a bad influence on me, and that I’m putting myself in danger by associating with him. But, I’m reluctant to distance myself from him, both because he interests me, and because I worry about what he might do. I know that, in all probability, in a year or two he’ll either have been admitted to a mental hospital or have killed himself (something he talks about constantly). Do I owe it to him, then, to keep associating with him? Or do I take a friend’s advice, and get out of this “before it’s too late”? P.S. — he sees a therapist already, but his mother (only caregiver) is unfit to raise him due to psychosis, so he doesn’t receive much help. Thanks in advance for any insight you can provide. [/INST]  Considering all that you have told me about this situation, I can’t, in good conscience, advise you to stay in this relationship. I, of course, can’t predict the future. Perhaps he will never harm anyone, but he is exhibiting many of the warning signs of someone who has the capacity to be violent.These warning signs include: his following you (which could be stalking), his “increasingly violent and twisted” thoughts, and his “strange, increasingly erratic” behavior, his insistence on discussing “dark or taboo subjects” despite his peers disinterest, and his “constant” discussion of suicide.Perhaps you don’t want to end the relationship because you’re flattered by his love, but it’s a mismatch if you only want to be friends. He’s not looking to be friends with you. If you don’t love him, then you are being unfair and misleading him by continuing the relationship. In your letter, you predict that he’ll eventually be admitted to a mental hospital or attempt suicide but you are overlooking a third, potential option: he attacks you because your attention gave him false hope.Your friends and peers see him as dangerous and someone to avoid. Why don’t you? Their instincts are correct. You should not continue this relationship. Fortunately, he is in therapy and working with mental health professionals. Let the professionals do their job and take the advice of your friends: end this relationship “before it’s too late.” Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Although I have a good boyfriend, family, and close friends, I feel completely alone. None of them know the “real” me, and lately I’ve thought about talking to a professional. I have a psychiatrist who gives me meds that helps me project this image of “normal” and “happy,” but I am still mentally ill and I have a dark side that nobody knows about. My emotions are limited and extreme (anxiety, depression, rage, empathy (way more than most people), and on occasion, elation). I also frequently fantasize about ways to kill myself, and I know eventually this will happen. This doesn’t bother me and I will not do it in the next year or so, because I have something I need to complete first. Lately, I’ve had this desire for at least one person in the world to know who I really am, and I have been thinking about seeing a therapist. The only thing holding me back from this is the fear of being involuntarily committed to a psych hospital, which has happened to me several times. Do you think if I go to a therapist and share this information he/she will have me committed? I do not want to be committed and I have not had any attempts in the last ten years, because I decided that when I do it, I want it to be right. Since I do not have a plan, do you think I will be committed if I share this information with a therapist? If so, I won’t go, but my secret dark side is eating away at me. (age 29, from US) [/INST]  Your question reminds me of the Anais Nin quote “And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.” My best advice is to follow your instincts. If you are thinking it would be a good idea to see a therapist, then see a therapist. Your fear of what might happen is holding you back from the possibility of getting better and in your own words: “for at least one person in the world to know who I really am.”Since you have been hospitalized in the past, you are most likely familiar with the criteria that need to be met for an involuntary commitment. It varies from state to state and country to country, but the bottom line is that you have the thoughts, plan and intent to harm yourself or others and are unwilling or unable to agree to an alternative plan. It is quite common for mental health professionals to work with clients who have suicidal thoughts and I would say that it is rare for it to lead to an involuntary commitment. Our first priority is to keep you safe and help you feel better.Take a chance on trusting someone to help you. You are worth it.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] On May 4 I got engaged to my boyfriend of 2 years. That afternoon I took a loan out to purchase him a truck. A week later we tried to get a mortgage on a home and found out that he has something in collection. So I suggested taking line of credit out in my name to bye off the collection. So next here we could then purchase a home and get married. Aug 2 he left for a 10-week course. In the 10 weeks he would only call once a week and he allowed the truck to bounce twice (I first figure the way his pay was going in and the way the payments were going out there wasn’t enough money (2 pays 3 payment in aug.) I didn’t get mad I went up and deposited $1000 to cover it. Once there I found out that he didn’t transfer anymore. I fly down to watch him graduate and see my friends (I was from there) and drive back with him. The trip sucked he wasn’t interested in me based on his saying, attitude and he stated drinking. I tried to talk to him and I was given the cold shoulder. Home (we don’t live together yet) My gut was telling me something was wrong so I decided knowing his password went on because I was concern about his drinking (recovering addict) if I could find something that would help me. Instead I found an email to the girl on course. I asked him about her and said I know because I read the email. He got mad at me saying he can’t trust me and walked out the door. I want to talk find out if it do to drinking, was it an emotional or physical affair. He tells me they were set up emails, and I am a fool and break off our engagement. I told him if we are not emotional together then we will not be financially together and I made him get his parents to co-sign a loan to buy the truck from me. He says he will continue making the line of credit payments. I want to believe him but I have a feeling I will have to take him to small claims court for this. [/INST]  I am sorry to be so blunt, but the truth is what is needed.Your boyfriend has a genuine disease. He is an addict and he is not in recovery. This means that he will use people, lie, and blame others rather than take responsibility for himself and his hurtful behavior.Yes, reading his emails in the way you did was wrong, but he is using that as the excuse to make you feel guilty rather thane deal with his lying, cheating, and stealing.Don’t waste more of your precious energy on him. He would need to be dedicated to a recovery process and immersed in that recovery for a good long while before he would be worthy of being trusted again.Move on. Learn these lessons and be grateful you learned all this before you made the mistake of marrying someone devoted to using you and not taking responsibility for himself.As you end this relationship I would strongly suggest individual therapy.

"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: FROM AGE 4 I WAS SEXUALLY EMOTIONALLY AND PHYCIALY ABUSED INCUILDING BEING GANG RAPED AS A CHILD. IS IT POSABLE TO GO FROM UNABLE TO BEING TOUCHED TO UM, OKAY FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING, BUT UM WANT THAT IN MY SEX LIFE?, IE THE WANTING TO BE HURT UM RAPED PUTTING MYSELF AT RISK SEEMS TO BE MY THING LATELY AND IT MAKES NO SENCE TO ME AT ALL. [/INST]  It’s not right — but it’s not unusual. Children who are sexually abused often end up thinking about sex in only two ways: Either I’m a victim and out of control. — or I can be in control by being a victimizer. Neither feels good so the person goes back and forth and back and forth between the two positions. A child doesn’t have the sophistication to think about a third option — the option of being comfortable and equal in a sexual relationship.If you are correct that your therapist is homophobic and uncomfortable talking about sex, then you need to change therapists. From what you wrote, it sounds like your therapist is as uneasy about sex as you are and you don’t trust her. That isn’t helpful. You need someone who is at ease talking about sexuality and intimacy and who can talk frankly and specifically about that third option.If it is possible that you are misreading your therapist, you owe it to both of you to at least try to talk about it. If the conversation goes well, it could be an important step in your healing. If it doesn’t go well, at least you tried. Then you should find yourself an LGBT therapist who specializes in sexual trauma.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] A few years ago, I experienced a very intense out-of-the-blue panic attack while out for a walk with my wife. I was convinced I was having a heart problem and dying. We went to the ER where they ran some tests that ruled out a heart issue. When discharged, I was given no explanation or even theories as to what happened to me, but was told to see my primary care physician. I did, and he didn’t have a clue either. My first correct diagnosis came from a Facebook friend who read my post telling my story, which I confirmed using WebMD. Since then one therapist told me I have GAD, and another panic disorder (I think they’re both right). I use Ativan as needed. I once tried Zoloft but it gave me a paradoxical reaction and I haven’t taken one since. While there are times when I can point to a specific trigger that sets me off, there are many other occasions when I experience “free-floating anxiety” which I can’t explain. I have read that CBT can be helpful in treating GAD, but I don’t see how identifying faulty patterns of thinking can help when there doesn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason for the anxiety in the first place. I recently saw a therapist for CBT who believes there is always a trigger for anxiety, even though it may not seem like it. Is free-floating anxiety real, what causes it, and can CBT help? Thank you very much. [/INST] A:  We are not always sure exactly what causes many psychological disorders, but it doesn’t make them any less real.  It’s generally thought to be a combination of family history (genetic predisposition) and life experiences. Anxiety disorders are quite common but are also very treatable. Sometimes the triggers can be identified and sometimes the anxiety attacks can truly come “out of the blue.” I’ve had many clients who wake up from a deep sleep experiencing an anxiety attack. In that situation, one would be hard pressed to identify a trigger. So yes, free floating anxiety is real and panic attacks can come without obvious triggers.It sounds like you are doing all the right things by seeking treatment, both with therapy and medication. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a very effective treatment for anxiety and depression. Generally speaking, our thoughts always precede emotion and behavior, so if we intervene at the earliest possible point in the cycle, we have a much better chance of getting symptom relief. The other thing to keep in mind is that we have thousands of automatic thoughts going through our minds all day long. So many that we aren’t always aware of what we are actually thinking about. Increasing this awareness, slowing the thoughts down and replacing negative thoughts with positive ones can really make some deep changes in how we feel. When treating anxiety disorders, I also teach clients about the fight or flight phenomenon, deep breathing techniques and lots of relaxation techniques. Having an assortment of coping skills makes a huge difference in managing anxiety symptoms when they pop up. There are many self-help workbooks available that give good explanations of these coping strategies. Many clients also benefit from taking yoga or meditation classes.I’d suggest sticking with the therapy for several months, as well as supplementing your treatment with the adjunct techniques I mentioned above. I hope you feel better soon.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m pretty much not very happy. I feel extremely lonely. I live with a grandma who constantly complains how she hates that I don’t do much, has high expectations, tells me I’m unable to go live on my own, and tells me my change of hair is bad. I stopped being close with my sisters at about. 13 years old. And I’m not close to any family. I don’t have friends, just occasional acquaintances at school. So needless to say, I am pretty alone and don’t get out of the house much at all. I’ve been bullied much of my life(at school)- 10th and 11th was by far the worst. I feel very insecure and self conscious now- I’ve turned into sort of a perfectionist and develop high expectations of myself. I feel overwhelmed and frustrated from small mistakes and I’m hard on myself. I don’t shower much or take care of my general health like I know I should; it’s become hard to do it regularly. I also don’t enjoy many things.. at least from what I experienced. 2 years ago (and beyond), I really enjoyed drawing, talking to people online through games, designing websites. I take no interest in any of it anymore. My days consist of school, YouTube videos, occasional comic reading, and looking up diets I always give up on anyways. Waking up even though I wish I could sleep forever. [/INST]   I respect the difficulty and you reaching out to find an answer. You are a courageous person for looking at what ails you. I would talk to one of your school counselors about the bullying. School counselors are now trained in helping student cope with this. I know it is a lot to ask, but you have taken the first step here — and you deserve to feel better. Talk to the counselors so that he or she can help you unravel what is going on. The thoughts and feelings you are having are not random. They are a direct result of the bullies and your situation with your grandmother. You deserve to feel better. Any thoughts other wise are just reactions to the difficult people you have had to deal with. Talk to the counselor today.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a young woman in Canada:  We dated for 2 years, lived together and were really in love. I had problems moving to a new city a lot of things happened and I was unhappy with anxiety. It was too much on him and we broke up. We tried again but he would be hot and cold.. one moment he would say he was committed to trying and the next I wasn’t right for him. He said he still loves me and he can’t. [/INST] I admire the bravery you are displaying in talking about these fantasies, urges, and preferences. What is most important about your thinking is that you are questioning yourself. I think you are asking a good question by reflecting on your preferences.You are right in noting that ephebophilia defines the primary sexual interest of mid to late adolescents—roughly 15 to 19, but from your description, this may not be your primary age-range preference. The presence of some level of sexual attraction doesn’t qualify as ephebophilia.Sexologists will often use specific terms for age group preference. Since you’ve identified yourself in your profile as a 20-year-old and you are primarily attracted to people your age this would technically qualify you as someone primarily attracted to adults, or what sexologist would call teleiophilia. If the attraction were to a younger, prepubescent children younger the term hebephilia would be used.Although these types of urges and fantasies are often referred to as paraphilia, or a sexual fetish, sexologists do not agree on the nature, range, or diversity of unusual sexual interests and paraphilias. But there are two things that most would agree on.The first has to do with the age of consent, which differs in different localities, as being a clear dividing line between urges and action. Your sensitivity to the idea that acting on some of these urges would be wrong is important to maintain. Consent given by someone not of age would not be valid.Secondly, it would be the distress or interpersonal difficulties caused by having these thoughts that would be important for you to seek counseling. If they interfered with your relationships with others, or caused undo distress you may want to talk with a professional about it.

"<s>[INST] Every time I’m left with nothing but my thoughts it’s the same story. I have an extensive conversation with myself about everything negative about my life and it always leads to me trying to figure out whether or not I might actually have a problem. Almost all of my friends and family have some form of mental health issue and it puts a strain on me to attempt to decode whether or not Im just experiencing something normal or something that I need to deal with. Its exhausting. I went out one night to a bridge only to discover it had no sheer drop but was a long incline. I still dont know whether I actually wanted to leap off or if I was trying to prove to myself that i wouldn’t do it and that I was just overthinking myself. In short. I have no idea whats going on in my head and I dont know what to do. Its hard to describe since i forget my thoughts until the next time im alone. [/INST]  You’re not alone in struggling to “decode” what’s wrong. I understand your frustration but you are not equipped to diagnose your own psychological problems. Humans are not born with an ability to understand psychological problems. That knowledge has to be learned, yet people often scold themselves when they are unable to solve their own problems. The layperson cannot diagnose mental illnesses because they have no training in this area. Mental health professionals undergo years of rigorous training and study to learn about psychological problems and how to treat them.If you are willing and open to it, you should consult a mental health professional. That would be the most advantageous and expeditious course of action. They would know what’s wrong and most importantly how to fix it.It’s worrisome that you would consider leaping off a bridge. Couple that with your negative thinking and it suggests that you might have depression. At minimum, it suggests that you are suffering with distressing thoughts. It is important that you know that there are treatments designed to address these very types of distressing thoughts. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a particularly effective treatment for negative thoughts. You don’t have to deal with these problems on your own. Therapy could be immensely helpful. I hope that you will consider it.People who attempt suicide often do so impulsively. You don’t want to put yourself in a potentially dangerous situation when you are at your most vulnerable. Stay away from dangerous situations and areas, such as the bridge you mentioned. If you cannot protect yourself from harm, then it’s imperative to seek emergency assistance. Go to the hospital or call emergency services. They will know how to protect you. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My brother is 15 years older to me and he has been really mean to me since I was a kid. I was emotionally and physically abused by him. Once he tried to kill me with a knife and other time he tried to beat me to death. In a normal day, I would have been humiliated by him regularly. He even broke my cat’s leg then my mom had to give the cat away and they lied to me about that. My parents never said him anything. Nobody to confront him. I went to therapy to get rid of this burden but recently something occurred and all my memories are back. I was hospitalized and he came to hospital to bring me home. He got tired of waiting so he decided to have dinner with his friends while I was alone at the hospital. Since my battery was dead I couldn’t call him and I had to go home alone. Not to mention my severe pain and suffering. When I came home, I called him to inform instead I was yelled at because I didn’t wait for him to come back from his dinner which took him so long. His yelling turned into threats, he said he will come to my door and beat me again so that I will regret to answer him back. I can’t digest this. How can someone be so senseless? My therapist said I should not have felt bad about this abnormal behavior because he clearly has mental issues. This doesn’t make me feel better. I am so furious and living with this anger for 6 months now. He is so proud not to apologize or anything. I am getting married soon, I don’t want to invite him. But that would have been awkward and upset the rest of the family members. I don’t know how to deal with this. Please help. (From Turkey) [/INST]   Your brother sounds both unbalanced and dangerous. I would do everything you can to protect yourself. Ask for your parents to come with you to your therapist to help deal with his abuse. Anyone who tried to kill you, beat you to death, broke your pet’s leg, threatens you, and doesn’t know how to have respect for you needs to be dealt with more directly. Explain the idea to your therapist. A family meeting about the history of his abuse, and the upcoming wedding and what to do about it needs a professional. Simply ignoring him isn’t the answer.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"

Anywhere on that spectrum is completely normal.If you’d like to be around more people, and perhaps to build up your self-esteem, I’d suggest you get involved with volunteering at a charity that matters to you and where other young people give their time.

It pops into my head throughout the day, unrelated to anything I’m doing, no matter what else is going on. [/INST] We all think about death from time to time, though psychologically it’s something that most people avoid. Thinking about death is uncomfortable. People don’t want to be reminded of their own mortality because it can generate a great deal of anxiety.Though many people avoid the subject, some others find that the focus on death gives their life meaning. That is the essence of existentialism, as a philosophy. For the existentialist, the awareness of death is important. It is a reminder that our existence is finite and that we shouldn’t take our lives for granted. For the existentialist, the focus on death has a positive rather than a negative influence in their lives.Your focus on death seems to be having a negative influence in your life. It’s potentially driven by anxiety which may signify an anxiety disorder. It’s not uncommon for people with anxiety disorders to be highly focused on death.I would recommend that you consult a mental health professional about your symptoms. He or she can determine if an anxiety disorder is present and if so, recommend a specific treatment. With anxiety disorders, it’s typically recommended that you receive help sooner rather than later. Untreated anxiety disorders tend to worsen. They don’t typically get better on their own.Anxiety disorders are highly treatable conditions.

"<s>[INST] I am in a new relationship(5 months). Yet I keep thinking about my ex. It’s been almost 3 years since i broke up with my ex of two years he was my high school sweetheart. We broke up because when i went away to college, he became a little controlling. That caused me to subconsciously move away from him and i started to focus on other men & in the end i cheated. We had a very bad break up and even though i ended things It left me depressed where from time to time i would suddenly burst into tears. Or not shower for a week and just lay in bed. I felt he deserved to be with someone better than me. He never knew that I had cheated on him and i confessed to him just recently, about 5 months ago. I asked him if he thought we would ever get back together. And he said that he didn’t think we could rekindle the relationship, which is why I tend to leave him alone. I’ve been in other relationships after him. And We communicate from Time to time to say happy birthday etc. But I do still think about him even in my current relationship. And the thing is i do not want to. I do not know why i do. My current boyfriend treats me so well and is not in the best financial situation but it’s not about the things he ca n’t do but what he’s willing to do with what he has he does have major trust issues which are plaguing this relationship and he knows i cheated on a previous ex. But When I’m with my current boyfriend I forget about my ex. but recently when we are apart i think of him. Mostly i burst into tears because i hate what i did to my ex(by cheating) and i wish i never did. And then i think of ways to get back together with him. All while being in my current relationship. [/INST] This has very little to do with your boyfriend and everything to do with intimacy. Getting back with your ex is filled with the same issues that caused the break-up. You want to get back with him while you’re in the current relationship. While you were with your ex you cheated rather than try to talk about the intimacy issues between the two of you.Your ex can always be the one that got away, which keeps you less connected to the man you’re with, and thinking about your ex is the way you keep yourself from getting closer to your current boyfriend.If you want to talk about your ex, find a good therapist for individual therapy. You will ultimately drive your current boyfriend away if you keep talking to him about your ex.In the meantime, write a letter to your ex that you do not send in which you write honestly about why you broke up with him. When you are done throw the letter away as it is the expression that is important — not the actual letter.Start focusing on the good aspects of your current relationship with the man you are with now. Make your current relationship an intimacy and communication priority, but talk about feelings for your ex with your therapist.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Germany: I am asking help on behalf of a friend who is in a difficult situation for getting help or treatment. He used to be a normal person, until his relationship of about 2 years was interrupted very suddenly and unexpectedly. After that he started ditching work, and eventually ended up giving it up altogether and moved in with his parents. [/INST]  Although I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of a short letter, what you are describing is consistent with someone who is significantly depressed. Although the loss of his girlfriend didn’t help matters, I don’t think that is the root of the problem. It is even possible that his depressed mood contributed to the break up. I can’t know without talking to him. I also can’t comment on whether his mother’s death contributes to his problem. That would depend on his relationship with her and how he and his mother handled her illness.Your friend is very fortunate to have such caring friends. Unfortunately, there isn’t much you can do beyond what you are already doing — talking to him and encouraging him to get into treatment. His father might have more leverage since your friend is living with him. His father could confer with a therapist about how best to help him and then try to involve his son.Treatment does work. Studies show that 75% of people who enter therapy do benefit. But therapy only works if the patient engages. You can’t do that for him.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  From a teen in Romania: By the time they are 18, most people have already had their first kiss and quite a lot of them have already had sex. I haven’t even come close to kissing anybody and I am terribly embarrassed by that. I can talk about it with really close friends probably because they also have a lot of different problems at this age and I feel like I am equal to them in a way because of that, even though their problems are different from mine. [/INST]  I don’t know where you get the idea that most people your age have had sex. A recent study of Romanian teens showed that only about 20% have had their first experience with sex before age 20. Teens aren’t always honest about their own experience. They often want to seem more experienced, more sophisticated and more knowledgeable than they are in order to “fit in.” Wouldn’t it be ironic if all the people you know are just trying to impress each other and none have actually done any of the things they talk about to fit in with other people who were also telling tales?Of more concern to me than your sexual inexperience is your discomfort around other people. With a therapist’s guidance and support, you can learn the social skills you need and to feel more confident socially.As for your worries about therapists: Therapists aren’t interested in judging. They are interested in helping. I doubt very much that a therapist will make you feel ashamed. (If one does, leave immediately and find someone else.)As for a way to start: Just bring your letter and this response with you and ask the therapist to read it as a way to start your first session.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] So I’m a 15 year old girl and my teachers sent referrals to my guidance counselor multiple times for her to speak with me because thy felt I was antisocial. My good friend and her whole family had died and I guess I was a little more aloof than usual at the time. Well when I was called into the guidance counselor a office she said that I had some things I needed to work put with her and that I needed to meet with her at least three times a week. She also felt that I had trouble doing things on my own so she said I had to go into her office on my own and say hi twice a day. I always found it odd. Whenever I’d go in there she’d tell me about her kids and how whenever she’d go home her one daughter would ask if she talked to me that day or not and she told me how she told her kids about me and I found that also odd because I barely even knew the woman. Whenever it was Friday she’d say,”When are you coming over for the weekend?” I really don’t know if this is odd or not. Then when it came the last day of school she got my cell number from a friend at school and texts me. Nothing bad or anything just anything you would text anybody I guess. She always text s and asks when she can pick me up to spend the day with her and her kids or go out to lunch but I always come up with some kind of excuse because I don’t know, I can’t hang out with my guidance counselor. I guess what I’m asking is this okay or odd? [/INST]  She might have quite wholesome intentions but it seems as though she may have crossed the line. It is unusual that she procured your phone number from another student, for the purpose of asking you to spend the day with her and her children. It makes you feel uncomfortable and professionally speaking, it is outside the boundaries of what is considered appropriate behavior.First and foremost, it’s important to tell your parents about the correspondence. They need to be fully informed about this situation. I would also recommend that you do not respond to her texts. You are not obligated to explain your lack of a response but you can tell her that if she wants to communicate with you any further, that it must be done through your parents.Understandably, having to tell your parents about this matter might put you in a precarious situation. You may not want her to get into trouble. Giving her the benefit of the doubt, she might think these extraordinary measures are appropriate; however, she may have gone too far.The most responsible course of action, is to involve your parents who can then report it to the school so that this situation can be corrected.Your counselor may be the kindest, most well-intended person on this earth but it is never appropriate, for her, to invite you to spend the weekend with her or to discuss you with her children. From what you have written, she is wrong, dead wrong.She should not be text messaging you or forcing you to stop by her office to say hello. Her behavior is simply not acceptable. She is dead wrong, even if she may be well intended.Finally, I want to commend you on your keen observational skills. You were right to ask this question and to suspect that something might be wrong. Don’t hesitate to write again if you have additional questions or concerns. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My 7yr old daughter is always moving her fingers, while she’s eating,while watching TV, at school. She mentioned it to me, she told me that she can’t stop doing it, but she said it doesn’t bother her. But I’m just really worried, that maybe something is bothering her and she doesn’t realize it. When she’s moving her fingers it kind of looks like she’s counting,because she does it in order, she has like a sequence, she touches her pinky with her ring finger, then she touches her ring finger with her middle finger,then she touches her middle finger with her pointer, then touches her pointer with her thumb and then sometimes she does it backwards. Thank you. [/INST]  It’s hard to know at her age just what is behind this kind of behavior. I’m assuming you would have mentioned it if you had other concerns. If she is a typical kid in every other way, I’d hold off the worrying for awhile. Kids stumble on things that soothe them. Some twist their hair. Some chew on a sleeve. Some develop more socially unacceptable habits like nail biting. Often these habits fade – especially if the grownups can refrain from making too big a deal of them. Since you’re not getting calls from her teacher or the school psychologist, I suggest you leave it alone for now. At the next parent-teacher conference, you could ask the teacher if your daughter does it at school too and if it is causing any difficulties for her.Is she exhibiting any other questionable behaviors? As stated on Everyday Health’s website, “According to the criteria that the American Academy of Pediatrics uses for the diagnosis of this mental disorder, children must exhibit ADHD behaviors before the age of seven and consistently for at least six months. Here are 15 signs that your child may have ADHD:”“Fidgets or squirms almost all the time. Children with ADHD are constantly moving their hands, arms, feet, and legs. They squirm a lot. Can’t sit in the same place for any length of time. A common symptom of children with ADHD is that they have trouble sitting still, Davenport says. They may get up at times when they know they are expected to stay seated. Doesn’t learn from experience. “These are the kids that you find yourself saying, ‘If I told you once, I told you a thousand times,’” Davenport says. Runs and climbs excessively. In teenagers, this symptom is often described as restlessness. Can’t wait her turn. The child cuts in line and butts into games other children may be playing. Interrupts others. Children with ADHD have trouble taking turns speaking and often blurt out answers. When they interrupt, they don’t realize they’re doing it, Davenport says. Has trouble following directions, no matter how simple. Seems not to listen when spoken to directly. You may ask your child over and over again to clean up his toys or to brush his teeth, and he can’t focus enough to respond and do what you say, Davenport says. Loses possessions. The child often loses things needed for school or at home, such as toys, pencils, books, or homework. Is disorganized. The child can’t organize tasks or activities so that he can complete them. Is unfocused. She is reluctant to do things that require thinking, such as homework or schoolwork. Can’t plan ahead. For example, your child may forget to bring home the books he needs for homework. Is forgetful. She may frequently forget to bring her lunch to school. Is unable to focus attention on activities or details. Children with ADHD are likely to lose interest in what they’re doing after about 20 minutes, sometimes even sooner, Davenport says. They constantly go from one activity to another. Goes off in his own world. You might suspect your child has ADHD if, when he is climbing on the sofa or jumping on the bed, he goes off into a world of his own and doesn’t respond when you tell him to stop. Your child may appear to be daydreaming frequently.”If you do get input from others that this behavior is becoming a problem, you could make an appointment to see a child psychologist for an evaluation. If there is a definable problem, you will get ideas for what to do. If the psychologist tells you it’s merely a way she automatically self-soothes, you will get peace of mind.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: Around age 7 my father began a serious relationship with my now step-mother. I also began to become sexually curious at this time. My step siblings and I would play some inappropriate games, such as spin the bottle, while exploring this curiosity. For my youngest step brother and I, this progressed over the years into a sexual attraction. By the time I was 13 we began to have oral sex and by age 16 we had intercourse. [/INST] There isn’t a simple answer to any of this, but I will share a few thoughts. It looks to me that what maybe started out as kid curiosity developed into an abusive relationship as the years went on. Lots of kids experiment with their sexuality with siblings or friends when they are young. Exploration of each other is not abuse; it’s innocent curiosity. But by the age of 7, most kids have been taught about physical boundaries and know that they are being “naughty” if they engage in more experimentation. It quite naturally stops.You didn’t say if there is an age difference between you and the steps. If they were the same age, we could see the initial incidents as experimentation among innocent peers. But if they were older and getting you to play spin the bottle, they knew better and were using you.As for the step brother who continued the behavior despite your efforts to stop it: That is abuse! There was nothing loving about it. He was using you for his own pleasure. The fact that he also made sexual overtures to your friends suggests that he had (and maybe still has) serious mental health issues.Please don’t beat yourself up about what happened. Your responses at the time are not unusual or abnormal. Your participation does not mean that you are at fault.You were desperate for the love of your family. It’s not unusual at all for a child to be confused about the difference between real love and sexual manipulation. Kids who need love will often comply with sexual demands — and may be led to believe that having sex means they are loved. Bodies often respond even when the mind doesn’t want to, which can be terribly confusing. Kids who don’t feel safe enough to tell adults (or who are convinced the adults won’t help anyway) feel helpless and often don’t tell.As for your parents: They managed their fears about what might be going by moving you to a room next door. They may have thought or hoped that would stop whatever was happening. From their point of view, they were protecting both of you. It wasn’t enough, but it was an effort.It makes absolute sense to me that you are having difficulty with sex and sexuality so many years later. As you have found, self-medicating with alcohol may make the act of sex possible but it does nothing to deepen love.You do need treatment in order to reclaim your sexual self. You do need treatment if you are to trust another person enough to enjoy true love and intimacy. Fortunately, there are alternatives to paid therapy. Here is an article from our archives that might be helpful. I also suggest that you join one of the forums here at PsychCentral.I caution you about writing a letter to your father without the support of a knowledgeable therapist or counselor. It’s important to have clear goals and to be prepared for whatever reaction such a letter might cause. It’s possible he will respond with loving kindness and an apology. It’s also possible he will deny what happened or blame you or not respond at all. Any such negative response might be re-traumatizing.Until you have more support, it might be more helpful for you to write the letter but not send it. Sometimes putting things down on paper helps people get something off their chest. It sometimes also helps the writer organize their thoughts and perhaps come to some new understandings.This is a painful past. I doesn’t need to result in a painful future. With good support from a therapist, you can get through this and have the life and love you deserve.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My husband is acting inappropriately, being rude, and judges me when I am in pain. I am 13 weeks pregnant, and we are financially distressed. We moved in with my in-laws, which my husband LOVES. I am an introvert, his entire family is extroverted, controlling, and often manipulative. I set healthy boundaries on my terms for them, and insist on being respected while avoiding confrontation. My husband used to be blind to their disrespect and control, but is improving by learning to set boundaries as well. I have been in a lot of pain this week. The baby is moving up and out of my pelvis, I have been working long hours, the management at work has been chaotic, and I have developed pain in the tendons of my left foot due to pregnancy weight gain. I set a boundary for my sanity: if it cannot be fixed right now, I don’t want to talk about it right now. My husband cannot understand this. He arrived at my work, frantic about bills, and proclaiming extreme gloom and doom. I was in pain, and a little short with him, because I will not be dragged into despair while under so many other pressures that I must overcome. I told him to stop. I clarified the situation, and explained this was exactly why I set my boundaries where I did. He was maxing out my mental self control, and he needed to stop. I helped him through his crisis, which was nothing more than a temper tantrum and despair mixed together, and said I needed more time to work out solutions for the problems. I worked out a solution within the hour. He has done this many times in the past month, and I have become increasingly less tolerant of the setting, and approach of these discussions. Yesterday during my switch shift break, my husband wanted to discuss his frustration and failure in turning off our Internet provider. I tried to express my opinion twice, and twice he cut me off. I became angry. I told him that was unacceptable, and I was done speaking to him, because it was obvious he was not respecting my opinion. He tried to tell me all my faults to win the argument, I told him that he knew I was exhausted and in pain. That he was being a jerk, and I did not have to tolerate that. I stormed off to stop my reaction. Last night, my abdominal muscles hurt, my back hurt, my left foot felt like my tendons were being sliced, and I was out of mental reserves, so I introverted to keep from being mean or short. My husband could not respect my boundary. He could not even see it. I expressed the pain, told him what I needed, and he chose right then to be super emotional and sensitive to the way in which I made my request. I had enough. I found a scarf, tied my foot in my best copy of the therapeutic splints I found online, and realized my husband was still going on and on about his feelings about how upset he was, how he couldn’t help me, and more about him and his feelings. I told him he needs to pay attention to his surroundings more while he is talking. I made my own splint in the time it took him to get all that complaining out. I explained I was in great pain. That I had zero tolerance for this level of pain, and this has nothing to do with him. He wanted to make the situation off topic and dramatic, but I stopped him cold. The issue was my lack of patience due to pain, and that was the absolute only discussion I was having, and only now that I had gotten off my foot. [/INST]  There is nothing in your story that would suggested it inappropriate or unfounded. However, it does sound like your husband needs to develop some coping skills with you. I would recommend contacting one of three places (or all three) to find some local counseling for both of you, or, if he is unwilling, for just you.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"

"<s>[INST] I’m a freshman in high school, just starting therapy bc of social anxiety and mild depression. We’ve had 3 sessions so far. My therapist is a man and I’m a girl, and having anxiety doesn’t make it great when talking with the opposite gender. Ive also avoided telling my therapist about things or lied about it bc I feel uncomfortable sharing my thoughts with someone else. The first time, I admitted about having suicidal thoughts to my therapist, which I’ve never told anyone else before, and I cried a lot afterwards. Having social anxiety makes me genuinely afraid of sharing things with someone else, even though my therapist has told me that he won’t judge me or tell anyone else about it. I’m very used to having thoughts all to myself. My therapist is a very good man, he can talk to me easily even though we’re far from the same age group and encourages me on my hobbies. But sometimes I would pop up thoughts like, “he’s just doing this to be nice,” “it’s just part of his job,” etc. I don’t know why these thoughts come up and they bother me a lot. I’m very scared of someone not caring enough about me. I just really don’t like sharing my thoughts with someone else, to me it’s very difficult to form it into words and actually tell someone else or write it down. Do I address this with my therapist? If I do, I don’t know how should I start it. I’m still uncomfortable around my therapist since we’ve only just started. [/INST]  I think that you identified the main problem when you wrote the following: “I’m still uncomfortable around my therapist since we’ve only just started.” That makes perfect sense. You don’t know him very well yet. It is uncomfortable to discuss your most intimate thoughts with a relative stranger. Relationships, therapeutic relationships included, take time to build. The more you and he work together, the more you will learn trust him and his advice.In addition to having only just met him, three sessions ago, you have social anxiety. The nature of social anxiety is being uncomfortable around other people, especially people who you don’t know very well. The social anxiety might make therapy more difficult for you, compared to someone without the added social anxiety.You may not see it this way but the fact that you have shared your suicidal thoughts with him is major progress. That had to be difficult for you but you did it. That’s a step in the right direction.Yes, you should address this problem with your therapist. Your feelings are perfectly natural and he’ll know how to help. One key to success in therapy, is honesty. Being honest will make it easier for him to understand what’s wrong and advise you accordingly.The next time you have a therapy session, simply say you have something you would like to discuss and proceed to tell him what you wrote in this letter. You might even show him the letter you wrote to us. It articulately and succinctly outlines your concerns and it would give him a deeper understanding about what you are thinking. You are off to great start. Keep up the good work. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I guess I have problems with self esteem. I hold myself to absurd expectations even when I know rationally that I shouldn’t. I seek unnecessary validation from people I shouldn’t, and then feel guilty about receiving validation. I sometimes feel a compulsive need to be better than other people, and place myself under extreme amounts of pressure beyond my realistic capabilities. [/INST]  You stated that you are depressed at times for no reason. This is akin to saying “that it rains at times” for no reason. We live in a perfectly logical world, as an engineering student, you should be willing to accept that fact. The biggest tragedy and failure in the United States aerospace program, was the explosion of the space shuttle. No one at NASA thought that the explosion was “for no reason.” There was an explosion and they search for and found the reason why. You have periods of depression and you should search for and find the reason why.I have stated before that growing up is hard to do and, though that may appear to be a trite phrase, it is absolutely true. You are in a period of transition. It is a time that demands growth within your very being. It is a period of instability and should end with your transforming into a stable adult. It is a metamorphosis of sorts.All of the things that you have described are typical of this period of time. Low self-esteem, shyness, feeling a desire to date but a great insecurity when attempting to do so, all of these things are common. You can attempt to deal with these things on your own, and you might succeed, or you can seek help in this process. If your car is not running right, you can try to fix it yourself and you might succeed but it is much easier with a far greater probability of success, to take that car to a professional, someone who is skilled and trained and experienced in fixing this type of problem. You are probably not familiar with automotive fuel injection or automotive computer diagnostic codes. I’m not suggesting that you could not learn these things but I am suggesting that it would likely take a long time and a great deal of effort. It is simply easier to take your car to someone who already knows these things.Fortunately, you are in college and most colleges offer free access to their counseling professionals. I would highly recommend that you take advantage of that opportunity. Mental health professionals are no less skilled than mechanics.If you feel it wise and acceptable and a desired course of action, to take your car’s problems to an experienced and educated automotive technician, I would think it reasonable to conclude that it would be similarly wise to take the problems that you’ve described to a counselor, who is also skilled and educated.I am glad to have made your acquaintance, even in this superficial way and I hope that I have been of some assistance, if even in a small way. Good luck. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: Alright, I am a male just shy of thirty. When I was fourteen years old I began having severe anxiety and have dealt with OCD since I was a child. I realize that OCD enables us to imagine things, which may be the case here. I have an uncle that is a psychopath. I realize that psychopaths aren’t wired to feel anxiety or irrational thinking, which, the anxiety alone would preclude me from possibly being a psychopath, but am still worried about the possibility of sociopathy. [/INST]  Thank you for writing. You’ve got yourself in quite a painful spin. Let’s see if I can help.From what you wrote, I don’t think you are a sociopath. I do think you are averse to conflict, that you have limited social skills and that you suffer from low self-esteem. The combination has led you to develop a “cover” for yourself; an alternative reality of someone who is socially skilled and has high self-esteem. As you are finding, it is very, very difficult to keep such a cover going. Lies have a way of coming undone. Sometimes it may even be difficult for you to know when you are lying to yourself.Fortunately, this is all fixable but you probably can’t do it on your own. (If you could, you would have done it long ago.) I highly recommend that you get into therapy with a licensed mental health counselor. Bring your letter with you to the first session. It is an articulate and honest description of the problems. With the support and advice of a counselor, you can develop a high enough self-esteem and become more confident in your social skills so you won’t need the deceptions.Please — give yourself the gift of a course of therapy. You are obviously smart. Writing here was a good first effort. now keep it going. Get on the phone today and find yourself the help you need.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My family and I had always been close until my mother passed away during my Senior year of surgical complications when I was seventeen. The event seemed to tear my family apart and put a “leper” sign on my back. I met someone online when I was twenty and decided to move from Ohio where my family lived to Florida with him and told them about our up coming wedding. My family vacations in Florida several times a year so when I told them that is where the wedding would take place three months in advance and they all promised to be there, I never suspected anything was amiss. [/INST]  I’m very sorry for your loss. Often it’s the mom who is the glue in the family. When the mother passes on, the family struggles to interact. For some people, it’s less painful to withdraw from each other than to acknowledge the loss.I don’t know why your family has deserted you so. But neither, apparently, do you. You can’t “buy” your family’s love and attention by putting yourself in financial debt. You can’t guilt them into coming by sending multiple “save the dates.” Before you put another dime into a second wedding, arrange a sit-down with key members of the family and talk it out. What put the “leper” sign on your back? Does it have anything to do with your behavior? Or do you remind them of mom too much? Or what? Once you have the answer to those types of questions, you’ll know what you need to do.If your family has indeed rejected you, there is sadly little you can do about it. What you can do is rejoice in having found a man who loves you and with whom you can make the kind of family you wish you had. By all means, have that second wedding if it will help erase the bad memories of the emergency wedding. Let his family celebrate with you — both for his good health and your marriage.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I don’t know how to recover from my husband’s psychosis. My husband was psychotic for about a year. It began shortly before our marriage (I attributed his behavior to stress – he owned a business that has since failed) and continued through the birth of our child. The psychotic episode was almost certainly spurred by his use/abuse of prescribed amphetamines (70m Vyvanse a day, 20m Adderal “as needed”) but the psychosis persisted for several months after he stopped the meds. [/INST]  What happened to your husband was an accident, just like a car accident. He was taking prescribed psychiatric medications under the direction of a physician and he became psychotic. He did not purposely become psychotic. The damage caused by his psychosis has been extreme in your life and his but that was never his intention. It seemed his intention was to try and receive help. The outcome was not within his control.When someone is in a physical accident they suffer from the consequences of the accident and the family also suffers. It is not unusual for someone to feel the way that you do. Commonly mental illness is viewed in a different light than physical illness. This may be because physical illnesses are seen as not being within one’s control. Mental illness, on the other hand, is often perceived as being controllable.Here is a very common scenario: An individual reveals to his or her family that he or she is depressed. The family responds: “get over it, “just snap out of it,” “it’s just a phase” or “you are just looking for attention.” There’s often no support. The implication is that the family believes that mental illness is controllable; after all, their suggestions are for the individual to take control. Alternatively, if a family member revealed that he or she was just diagnosed with cancer or had their hand cut off in an accident, in most cases the family would respond with sympathy and empathy.It is important to keep in mind that one does not choose to be mentally ill. It is not appropriate to be angry at someone for being mentally ill. An individual has no control over the development of mental illness.Among individuals with schizophrenia, for instance, part of their illness causes them not to be able to recognize that they’re ill and subsequently many don’t take their medication. Family members become very angry that their loved one doesn’t recognize their illness and refuses their medication. The reality is that the illness robs many individuals with schizophrenia of their ability to realize that they’re ill. Anger in these situations is perfectly understandable but it’s misplaced because no one chooses to be mentally ill.You say that your husband has changed. He is also improving. It may be simply a matter of time before he returns to the man that you married. What happened to him was tragic for him and also you. You are both victims of his illness.You married him for some reason. There was something that you loved about him. He has changed; people often do so in a relationship. When your partner is no longer the person that you married, many people reevaluate their relationship and some choose divorce. Your husband has changed because of his mental illness. He is no longer the man that you married. He may return to the person that you married but he may never again be the same. Marriage is a commitment. Some believe that is a lifelong commitment. Some believe that the commitment extends beyond this life and into eternity. Others believe that marriage should only continue until you become dissatisfied and they fully see divorce as a part of life. Divorce is a moral decision. Each of us must make that decision.Before considering any major changes to the relationship I would strongly suggest that you seek counseling. Therapy can help you navigate your situation and also assist you in dealing with your intense feelings of anger.

"<s>[INST] I love cutting my skin open so much. Although sight of blood makes me sick (and seldom faint), I love watching blood oozing out of my self-inflicted wound. I am extremely addicted to it. I don’t understand. Why is this happening and what can I do to prevent it. (I have talked to a number of psychologist but that did not help.) [/INST] Generally, people engage in self-harm behaviors when they are suffering. Many have said that they do it as a way to relieve their emotional suffering. The physical pain is a distraction from their emotional pain. In actuality, it provides no real benefit. It is something that should be avoided. It’s also a sign that someone needs help.Self-harm is a maladaptive attempt at coping with painful emotions. It is often indicative of an individual who is suffering but who lacks effective coping skills to deal with emotional pain. These skills can be learned in therapy.To characterize self-harm as an addiction is to suggest that you have no control over it. You can choose to stop at any time. You are choosing not to stop. Realize that you can make better choices. Choose not to do this to yourself. That power is within your control.You find it to be pleasurable, just as a drug addict finds using to be pleasurable. The drug addict must want to quit; must want to give up the pleasure for the benefits of being clean. If you really want to quit, with help, you can. You enjoy the pleasure you get from cutting. If you want to stop, you can with a good therapist. If you want a good therapist to stop you from enjoying, cutting, marijuana, heroin, alcohol etc., that won’t happen. You can’t go to the therapist and say “I want you to stop me from enjoying smoking.” You need to say ” I enjoy smoking but I want to stop despite the pleasure it gives me.” You can’t say to the therapist “take away the pleasure I get from my addiction.”Even though you’ve already tried a number of psychologists, don’t give up. Keep searching for the right mental health professionals. Both psychologists and licensed clinical social workers can provide talk therapy. Psychiatrists prescribe medication. Temporarily, medication might help you to gain control over your behavior. Don’t give up searching for help, until you find it. Stay safe and please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] from the U.S.: My earliest, clear childhood memories began at about age 10-11. From what I’ve read, blocked memories are most often associated with some kind of traumatic event, but what I can recollect of my childhood was, while certainly not perfect, generally happy. (Although I suppose the whole point of this is that if there was trauma and I’ve blocked out the memory, of course I wouldn’t remember it…? It’s all a little frustrating.) [/INST]  You are correct to be cautious about hypnosis with this complaint. The mind does hate a vacuum, and it is not at all unusual under hypnosis for an individual to come up with creative “memories” that are not true. Complicating things further is that although the truth of the memories is questionable, the person’s confidence in such “memories” is high. High confidence in false memories has created a great deal of pain in some families.You are also correct that having so few memories is unusual. Most people’s continuous memory starts around age 4. But unusual doesn’t mean never. There are a number of reasons that people lose their long term memory. Severe abuse is one cause of “blocked memories,” but it is not the only reason. Here are a few more:I suggest you see your doctor and perhaps a neurologist to get an evaluation. It’s always important to rule out medical causes for difficulties before deciding they are psychological.Meanwhile, continue to talk to the people in your family you love and trust. Look at old picture albums. Perhaps stories and pictures will trigger memories for you.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Q. Are hallucinations in any way a projection of either the unconscious or the subconscious mind? To state an issue that occurred in my own family, when a family member underwent a surgery, her sodium levels dropped. She is one of the rare cases where low sodium levels induces hyperactivity and hallucinations. Although we have been told that the reason for her behavior is rooted in biological causes and changes, I would like to know the impact of such changes on the subconscious mind and whether there is any information unknowingly projected out by the individual through hallucinations. The aforementioned family member, post-surgery, looked at a fan and starting scolding it as if it were a person. Yet when asked what/who she was scolding, she answered saying that she was scolding the fan itself. [/INST]  You ask a question that tests the very limits of science. Anyone who gives you a simple answer is guilty of being simpleminded. Really, what you are asking is what is the nature of reality and the place of consciousness within that reality.It would be nice to think that reality is obvious and that science, for the last hundred years or so, has shown us a blurry picture and that over time, through the advances of science, that blurry picture simply becomes more and more in focus. Another way of saying this, would be to say “we know what it is but we don’t know all of the details. With the passage of days and weeks we discover more and more of the details.”But the truth is the exact opposite of that statement. The very best scientific minds recognize that reality and the place of consciousness in reality is exceedingly difficult to determine and is likely to be not at all what we thought it to be. Put very simply but quite inadequately, it is the difference between Newtonian physics and quantum physics. Strange things happen in quantum physics and we have known this for 100 years. Experiments have been repeated year after year, decade after decade, yielding the same results and though it would be convenient to ignore these results, they cannot be overlooked.Many books have been written about the findings of experiments in quantum physics and additional books, have been written summarizing these results and expounding upon their meaning. It would not be the slightest exaggeration to say that the very best scientific minds of our time are primarily focused on these issues. They are scientists that are nationally recognized as being among the very best, internationally recognized as being among the very best and some are Nobel prize laureates.One of America’s best scientists, Robert Lanza has written two books on the subject. The first was titled Biocentrism: Robert Lanza’s Theory of Everything and the second was titled Beyond Biocentrism: Rethinking Time, Space, Consciousness, and the Illusion of Death. You can watch Ted talks and see Dr. Lanza explain his understanding of this subject. He is not alone in his beliefs; many great minds concur. To summarize their position in the simplest of all possible terms, “it ain’t simple.”I can’t give you a simple answer about your family member. We know the drugs can be psychoactive, which means that they can enter the brain and distort its functioning. With hallucinogenic drugs like LSD, people have said that they can hear colors and see sounds. If your loved one returned to normal functioning, after this hospital event, problem solved. After that, any deeper probing enters an area of science that is simply not understood.The very best minds in science are studying the nature of consciousness and being. It is not a simple subject, but it is not beyond the understanding of the reader of my words.If you read both of Robert Lanza’s books, don’t expect to be an expert but you will have an understanding. Experts study for years and if you want to be an expert you also will need to study for years but you don’t need to be an expert to be impressed with the work of these scientists and to gain whatever understanding that you desire.I hope that you don’t think that I’ve avoided your specific question. I have instead answered in the best way I possibly could. To know the effect of the unconscious and subconscious upon the conscious mind, one would need to know about the true nature of the unconscious and subconscious and conscious minds and quite honestly, no one really knows. Since I do not, nor does anyone else with whom I am aware have a complete understanding of these areas, then anything is possible. Without knowing all, who can say what is not a part of the all?The important thing is that modern science has hopefully returned your loved one to a happy, normal existence. How to return someone to a normal existence or state of being, is thankfully practiced every day in therapist’s office across the world and if I may add, with great success. Let me leave you with this. Understanding how to return someone to a “normal” existence is a far different question than that of the true nature of existence. Good luck, my friend. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I have been in an unhappy marriage for five years, since our daughter was born to be exact. Although she makes me feel so lucky and a very happy mom, my husband and I seemed to agree to be a team and work together for the sake of her happiness. I always thought that doesn’t matter how difficult our relationship gets, I would never leave him because I don’t want our daughter to grow up with divorced parents. I promised this to myself, until I met “The One”. [/INST]   I can’t tell you what to do. I can tell you that using “The One” to crowbar yourself out of your marriage is a mistake. Moving from one relationship to another without taking the time to heal generally results in repeating some version of the same situation. You need to take the time to make sense of why you were drawn into such an unloving marriage and to learn new ways to be in a relationship.If you want to leave your marriage, leave it for all the reasons you gave in your letter. Those are the reasons that matter — not the entrance of the new guy — and those are the reasons you should give your husband if you decide to separate. Neither of you should be distracted from those realities by focusing on “The One.” You should be talking about why your relationship is failing.Frankly, I don’t believe in anyone being “The One.” I think you are drawn to this guy because he is such a contrast to the man you are with, and he offers you a way out.If “The One” truly loves you, he will give you a year to recover from the marriage, to find your own identity outside of that relationship and to look at him clearly (without the stardust of being favorably contrasted with your husband).I sympathize with your desire to give your daughter a positive model for adult love. I understand why you want to give her the kind of stable upbringing you had. But it’s also important to consider whether the environment you and your husband have created for her is the healthiest.Fortunately, you and your daughter’s father do know how to be a solid parenting team. That shouldn’t change if you divorce. He should stay in her life.You and your daughter are both young. If you do divorce, you have plenty of time to recover and to find new love. You have plenty of time to work on making the kind of family you’ve always wanted.I wish you well,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teenaged young woman in the U.S.: There are times where I feel completely fine emotionally, but I’ll find myself thinking “I hate my life” or “I’m a worthless pice of crap” or something else along those lines. It doesn’t make any sense. As soon as I think something like that my immediate reaction is to think/say to myself “what are you talking about, no you don’t/aren’t.” [/INST]  I’m very glad you wrote. Yes, I do think that everything is related. What you may be describing is evidence of a sleep disorder. The emotional upheaval may be a consequence of it. Do a little research on sleep disorders and see if it fits.There are a number of possible causes of sleep disturbances. The first step should be a visit to your primary care physician to make sure there isn’t a physical cause like a thyroid condition. If you are medically okay, then it would be helpful for you to talk to a therapist to learn some ways to get your sleep cycle back in order.Your parents may be more receptive if you tell them that there is a high probability that your problem is medical, not psychological.I wish you well.  </s>"

[/INST]  A boy who isn’t mature enough to talk to you himself about wanting to just be friends isn’t mature enough to be going out with anyone. To his credit, he knew he should slow down. Now you should too. If you like him a lot, develop the friendship. Maybe it will grow into something more and maybe not but I wouldn’t throw away a friendship because of this. Good friends are hard to find. At 15, you have plenty of time to find a boyfriend.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a 13 year old girl in the U.S.: My Stepdad is crazy. He hasn’t done anything to hurt me physically, but just today he said, and I quote. “I hope you end up weighing 300+ pounds.” This made me think back on so many things, he would sometimes insult me on other matters like how “Ignorant” I am. He is the one to talk, the man smokes and drinks, even though he is completely aware of the consequences, he downs sweets like I down water, and I only ever feel safe when he isn’t around. [/INST]  A rampage like that would make anyone feel unsafe. I don’t know if your stepdad is “crazy,” but I do know that his behavior was out of control. I hope you are talking to your mother about what happened and what she is doing about it.No kid deserves to feel put down and scared in her own home. This family needs support and counseling if it is to be a happy one.If your mom won’t make it clear to your stepdad that violence and insults won’t be tolerated, she may be as scared as you are. In that case, it may be helpful for you to talk to your school counselor or another trusted adult about how to help your mom.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 months now and we are currently living together in a studio apartment. We both have trust issues, he has trust issues because he has been hurt in the past and I have them because he has now lied to me and hidden things from me. A couple months into our relationship I found out he had been on social media talking to other girls very often and having them text him but he would never keep the messages he would always delete them off his phone. Whenever I confronted him he would get extremely defensive. About a month ago I looked through his phone and found out that he had still been talking to other girls, I had asked him before if he was still talking to them and he told me he wasn’t. When I found out I asked him why he lied to me and he said it was because he knew I would get mad if he was talking to other girls. I just don’t understand why he would do this to me if he truly loved me … I can control myself so why cant he control himself? He said he wanted to gain my trust back and I told him it wouldn’t be easy, he will have to endure many questions and a lot of skepticism but he was up for the challenge so he said. Since then whenever I ask him questions he gets defensive it seems like he is still hiding things from me or it could be me becoming super paranoid because I don’t want to be hurt again. I don’t know if I should stay or leave, the fact that he has failed to put effort in to regain my trust makes me feel like he doesn’t feel the same about me anymore and to be honest I am starting to feel different about the situation as well because it doesn’t seem like I am worth it to him to make more of an effort. I don’t know what to do or how to understand him at all, can you give some insight? [/INST]  Thank you for writing us. To be honest there isn’t much here that seems valuable for continuing the relationship. If his best excuse is that he didn’t want you to get mad for finding out that he was talking to other girls, then what is he really saying? He’s not apologizing –he’s not saying he’s willing to change, he’s simply telling you that he was afraid he’d get caught: Not very convincing. I wouldn’t waste my time. If the best he can do is get defensive rather than trying to understand why you would be angry, it’s time to move on.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: Hi, I am a 32 year old Indian woman living in the states. I have been married for 4 years and have a 1 year old boy. [/INST]  This may be a cross-cultural issue I don’t entirely understand. From my point of view, the problem isn’t with your in-laws. The problem is that you and your husband haven’t worked together to draw boundaries around your own family.The two of you are letting the older generation make decisions that, from an American’s point of view anyway, aren’t their decisions to make. I understand that the grandparents want to spend time with their child and grandchild. But I can’t imagine relatives announcing (not asking) that they will stay for months at a time in an already crowded apartment.I strongly urge you and your husband to talk seriously and calmly about to what extent you are going to continue doing things that are perhaps traditional in India, but are not at all the way western families operate. From an American point of view, you and your husband are adults, not children who need to do whatever his parents think is right. Your in-laws can only come to visit if the two of you let them. People can only stay with you as long as you agree to let them stay. Your in-laws should not have the power to decide when and for how long you will visit your own parents. It’s your husband’s job to tell his parents to treat the wife he loves with respect. It is your job to calmly but firmly tell them that their insults are not appropriate. But those are all American responses to their behavior.It doesn’t have to be one way or the other; Asian or America: You can decide on compromise positions. You may have to make changes gradually. As examples: You could limit visits to a month a year or state that relatives can certainly visit but they need to stay in a nearby hotel. You could decide to alternate visits between his family and yours to make things fair and even. You could ignore your in-laws dictates and decide your own travel schedule so that your family gets to spend as much time with you and your child as your in-laws.Change is never easy. But neither is the current situation. You are caught between two value systems — the one you were brought up with and the one you are living in now. I hope you and your husband can figure out how to balance the two, even though his parents probably won’t like it.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello. I have had this dream a few times in my life with four different partners. I dream that I find out that they were born a man (usually a disproportioned ugly man), then at some point in their life, they had a sex change operation to become a female, and have hid that fact about themselves. None of the women I’ve had this dream about are manly in any way, they were petite and very feminine in personality and looks, and the dream is quite disturbing as I do not know why I dream about it, or whether it is a good dream or bad. In the dream, when I find this out, I do not believe it at all and try to prove the obvious impossibility of she being a man, and I become very disturbed and sick, also incredibly depressed about the dishonesty. Once I unwillingly accept that she was a man, she starts to change slightly into the man, like I start to see similarities between her false feminine perfection and the man that she was, and I start to get more sick and disgusted, and start to loathe myself for being so blind and not seeing it. The dream usually consists of the above, and a dragged out confrontation between her and myself, and an internal dialogue between my sane and rational self and my dream self who accepts it, the former explaining the obvious impossibility of her being a man and the latter always proving that it must be true. I wake up sick to the stomach, and restless, and knowing that it is not true at all. I just can’t figure out why I dream that, and why so often, it kind of eats away at me and I start to distrust my partners sincerity, so the dream definitely affects me negatively. Please help me make sense of this? Thank you. [/INST]  Thank you for sharing your dream with me. Unfortunately, an accurate analysis of the dream isn’t possible because there are a variety of different conditions, influences, and history that I am not aware of. As an example the dream could be a way of highlighting the struggle for intimacy with her or it could be about a transition in her life that is threatening you. There are also other interpretations about sexual identity concerns, or unresolved issues from childhood that are possibilities.The one thing that is certain is the dream is disturbing to you and has captured your attention. I tend to view all dreams as being valuable because they have broken through our unconscious to get our attention. We should wrestle with them to figure out why.My strong encouragement is to track down a therapist who has proficiency in dreams. Not all therapists will be able to help you with the interpretation, but when you are interviewing them ask if they work with dreams in their practice. Until then keep a dream log of what was happening the day you had to dream, the description of it, and the feelings that came along with it. This will be good information for you to bring the therapist.Wishing you patience and peace, </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m a 19 year old male who used to smoke pot when I was 15 here and again, and it never had an effect on me. 10 months ago I had my first panic attack out of no where and had an anxiety attack every night for 3 days. My mum was on vacation and it was just me and my girlfriend. After 2 days my conditioned worsened to the point where I was laying in bed shaking, afraid to leave the house, feeble and hazey. My neighbour took me to a doctor and he prescribed me with Citalopram. The first day I took it, I had a high of where I said ‘oh my god I feel back to normal’ for about an hour, then after; a low of where I was crying which faded out during the evening. I took my second tablet the next day of where the same thing happened but I decided to come off them. 10 months have passed and my anxiety is extremely at bay, however.. my brain feels re-wired. I feel (as the internet describes) depersonalized (DP/DR) it started off terrible being the only thing on my mind but now I don’t think about it and I am able to live my life. However.. I still feel different, as if something has changed the way I feel and view reality. Although I can ignore it and get on with my life; I still feel like this ‘not real feeling’ is a black cloud that has improved but may not ever go away. Ever since that panic attack, reality hasn’t seemed the same since and I always yearn to go back to when my life was.. ‘normal’. I know I’m not crazy and I don’t have thoughts of suicide, but a lot of the time I’m wondering why I don’t feel as happy as I should. I feel great after the gym and eating healthy sure; but constantly my mind is saying ‘you feel great.. but not as great as you used to, there must be something you’re not doing’ what do you think has happened? Do you think my mind has gone through so much trauma that it’s re-wired itself or taken a different course? – thank you. [/INST]  It’s difficult to know with certainty why you feel different. Generally speaking, illegal drugs alter brain chemistry. That’s, in part, why drugs are so dangerous. Many people underestimate the risks of drug abuse. Teenagers especially see it as harmless experimentation or even a rite of passage. People who use drugs and who don’t suffer negative consequences are fortunate and rare.Anecdotally, I receive many letters from people like you, who have used marijuana and who have developed similar symptoms. Recent reports indicate that one of the most common reasons someone goes to the emergency room, for anxiety symptoms, is due to marijuana use. Some people have a bad reaction to the drug and it scares them.You may want to reconsider the medication you were prescribed. It might help. You only gave it two days. Typically, antidepressant medications take approximately 1 to 3 weeks to work. You didn’t give it enough time to do its job. It may have helped you, but you didn’t give it a chance. You should discuss this with your prescribing physician.You might also consider counseling to address what might be derealization symptoms. It’s possible that anxiety and derealization are related and psychological treatment could help eliminate both of these symptoms.It’s also important to proactively prevent another anxiety attack. You’ve described your anxiety attacks as coming out of “nowhere,” but most commonly they are triggered by something. If you identify the trigger, you might prevent them. Therapy could be beneficial to you at this time. Please take care. </s>"

One potential problem area is your relationship with your boyfriend. He has a problem with addiction related to excessive time on the computer. You also stated that he does not have a job. The reason he does not have a job may be related to his addiction.Other issues that you mentioned include the fact the you feel as though you have an addiction to chronic masturbation. Another potential problem is that you are having sex with men for money. You also described being emotionally unstable, grieving the loss of your father, you may be experiencing stress associated with your mother being in a wheelchair, and you “enjoy” hurting others and animals. Those are all signs of instability.It is possible that the recent loss of your father is the cause of or has exacerbated your problems. You could greatly benefit from outside intervention. My recommendation is to see a therapist.Don’t ignore your problems. Much of what you have described is abnormal and it is hurting you and potentially others. I’m not certain how the mental health system works in your country but it would be advisable see a mental health specialist as soon as possible. It is especially important to do so soon, since you feel as though you cannot control your behavior. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: For as long as I could remember I liked being alone. I think it’s starting to really effect me though as I start to get older and enter the adult world. Every time I’m out with friends I feel uncomfortable and awkward. I always feel like I’m putting a front or an act in front of everyone I speak to and I could only feel at ease when I’m at home by myself. When I’m alone I feel as though I don’t think. Like I’m just alone in my room for hours imagining a better life and different scenarios of my pretend life when really I’m just laying in bed doing nothing. Is that normal? [/INST] No, you are not alone in this. At 17, you are aware of the increasing expectations (by yourself and others) for you to enter the adult world as a fully functioning adult person. Those expectations can be daunting. Since you find them overwhelming, it make sense that you retreat to daydreaming as an alternative to dealing with the difficult reality.However, this is a problem that only spirals downward. The more you retreat, the less comfortable you will be in the company of others. Instead of getting practice in communicating well and developing confidence in yourself, you are becoming convinced you can’t do either.It may be that you are developing the symptoms of social anxiety. Everyone has some degree of worry about how they will be received by others and whether they can manage the multiple demands of a social situation. But symptoms of social anxiety are not just a momentary case of “stage fright”. When social anxiety reaches a clinical level, the person becomes so fearful of the judgment of others and so convinced that she can’t fit into the social world that the stress is just too much to handle. People with social anxiety dread being in a variety of social situations. This can severely limit a person’s life.People tend to see those with social anxiety as shy or aloof or even snobbish. But the truth is that the client really does want to have positive relationships and to be included. The social anxiety has become a huge barrier.The physical symptoms of social anxiety are individual. Some people feel dizzy or lightheaded. Or they might feel tension in the body. Some people develop stomach pain and diarrhea or a racing heart, blushing or sweating. Meanwhile, the person perseverates about their fear that they will do or say something that will offend someone else or humiliate herself. Basic social skills dessert her.Such clients develop a variety of strategies for managing life. Some will only go anywhere if they are accompanied by someone they trust. Many significantly limit their contact with others. Others develop a full blown phobia and never leave their house.The good news is that social anxiety can be treated. The success rate is high. Research has shown that the treatment with the best results is active, structured, cognitive-behavioral therapy. This type of therapy has been shown to to change the neural pathways in the brain permanently.The earlier you get treatment, the less of your life will be wasted by holing up in your room. I urge you to make an appointment with a therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders as soon as you can.While you wait for your appointment, you might find it helpful to read “Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy” by Dr. David Burns. In it, he explains social anxiety more fully than I can here. He also describes a number of techniques you can use to help yourself feel better and more self-confident.I wish you well. </s>"

I felt no love whatsoever and would not until I was 25 years old. [/INST]  Thank you for writing. You have already done many courageous things. As difficult as it will be, you can also learn how to make friends and find love. You are lonely because you are so alone. Fortunately you live near a very helpful program. Please consider contacting them. I can’t vouch for the quality of services since I only know of them through their website but it seems like a good place to start.I strongly suggest that you get involved with some group therapy if it is offered. In a group therapy setting, people try out new behaviors and then get feedback from others who are struggling with similar issues. Group members help each other learn how to be more approachable and how to interact with people more successfully. A trained therapist guides the group process so the situation is safe and supportive.Putting energy into some self-improvement makes sense. You may well live another 40 years.

I hate myself for it but I can’t control my anger. I have a really low self esteem and don’t value myself at all. [/INST]  I think you need to do two things: First, please make an appointment with your doctor for a complete medical check up. I always recommend this when someone your age is so moody. There are a number of physical changes going on at your age that can cause what feel like out of control mood swings. Let’s make sure you are medically fine before deciding that “it’s all in your head.”Secondly: I strongly urge you and your parents to see a family therapist. Yes, you get angry and out of control. But your parents don’t seem to know how to help you or how to stay out of fights with you. The three of you need some new tools to learn how to deal with each other’s anger and how to manage conflicts that come up. You will be living at home for a number of years yet.

"<s>[INST] I have bipolar disorder and have been on treatment for 9 years. I have recently switched mood stabilizers (doctor’s orders) and I am also going back to college to get my bachelor’s degree at the age of thirty.

Anything you can tell me would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. [/INST]  You have asked a very good question but it is difficult to answer because mood is relative. “Normal” mood varies considerably person-to-person. I would discuss this question with your therapist who presumably has had the opportunity to experience the variation in your moods. He or she most likely would know what would constitute mania for you or simply a good mood.It also would be helpful to create a description of what characterizes your good moods and what characterizes a manic episode. What are the differences? What would your husband say the differences are? What would your therapist say the differences are? Together, you and your therapist and husband, could attempt to create a definitive list. This information could be a valuable tool for you and could help resolve disagreements between you and your husband.Another idea to discuss with your therapist, would be calling him or her during the height of a suspected manic episode. Agree in advance that you will allow your therapist to determine whether you are experiencing mania or just a good mood. If you designate your therapist as the arbiter, it might help to reduce your husband’s anxiety. In addition, create a plan for handling each possible outcome. For instance, if your therapist suspects mania, you will agree to call your psychiatrist and request a medication change or schedule an extra therapy appointment for the week. Think of it as creating an advance directive for your mood. Be certain to include your husband in all of your plans.Congratulations on remaining in treatment, your symptom improvement and on your return to college.

"<s>[INST] My mother is a schizophrenic. My mother is around 47 years old and she’s had schizophrenia since before she got married in her 20s I guess. My mother has turned against almost all of our relatives, we have no family friends and we barely go out. As they create scenarios in their mind and believe it’s true. I have a feeling my mother is gradually turning against us. Is this possible? [/INST]  Yes, unfortunately, it is possible for an individual with schizophrenia to “turn on their family.” I worked on a research study in which we were attempting to build a website for individuals with schizophrenia and their family members. We had to alter our recruiting process because we found that so few individuals with schizophrenia had retained positive connections with their family.It is important to separate the individual from their illness. In other words, an individual with schizophrenia might “turn on their family” because of their symptoms, not because they don’t love their family. Individuals with schizophrenia are not thinking clearly. Schizophrenia is a thought disorder. Delusions, hallucinations and paranoia interrupt an individual’s logical thinking ability and tricks them into believing in a false reality. That is the cruel nature of the disease.I worked with a client who believed that her husband was plotting to harm her. Every move he made was perceived as being part of his plot to harm her. At one point, she called the police and falsely reported that he was dealing drugs just so he would be arrested. She only did it because she wholeheartedly believed that he was attempting to harm her. He was not but in her illogical mind, he was. By having her husband arrested, she was attempting to protect herself.In many ways, schizophrenia is a family disease because it affects the family to such a large degree. In the example above, it would’ve been understandable for the client’s husband to have been furious with her for having called the police but he realized that she did it because of her illness. No one wants to have or chooses to have schizophrenia. Schizophrenia afflicts people of any gender, race, or socioeconomic status.With regard to schizophrenia being passed on genetically, it is possible. Having a family member with schizophrenia increases the likelihood that other family members will develop the disorder. It does not guarantee that members of the family will develop the disorder but the genetic risk is real, though slight.Your brother is also showing signs of schizophrenia and “some people” believe that he is possessed by demons. Historically, individuals with schizophrenia were thought to have been possessed by demons. The current understanding of schizophrenia is that it is a brain disorder that is brought on or exacerbated by stress. If your brother is experiencing signs of schizophrenia, then he should be evaluated by a mental health professional immediately. Time is of the essence with regard to schizophrenia and psychosis. The sooner that he can begin treatment, the sooner his symptoms can be decreased or eliminated.I would recommend contacting the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). NAMI is an advocacy group that provides support and psychoeducation about mental illnesses. Many NAMI members have family members with mental illnesses and can relate to your situation. I wish you the best of luck.Kristina Randle </s>"
"<s>[INST] I really hope I get an answer because it’ll go a long way to help me out in life. And in my part of the world therapy isn’t too common so life’s problems are blamed on several other weird stuff. I am 21 and it feels like my life’s crash down already. I got admitted into the university, everyone in my humble home had high hopes for me. I aced all my entry exams and got admitted with 2 scholarships. In my first year in school all seemed well, then I got myself involved with a girl. I did love her very much. I still do. But she left me. Though it wasn’t said to my face all indications pointed to the fact that I couldn’t treat her right or take care of her. I was devastated when she left. Around that time my Uni grades became horribly bad. So bad I knew I’d get 2 extra years in a 5-year course when I was in my second year. After a difficult job of pulling myself together. I found my self involved with another girl who had similar problems with mine. Her boyfriend was ‘mean’ to her & she felt she deserved better. I thought I was moving on only to realize I was just being used to forget the ‘mean ex’ or make the ‘mean ex’ jealous. 2 heartbreaks? Funny thing is sometimes I feel that’s the least of my problems. My biggest problem is graduating and making my parents smile once again. I’ve been thinking if disappearing for a awhile will help? I don’t want anybody thinking about me. I just want to be left alone. The first girl claims she misses me and the second girl seems comfortable with just the sex. I just want to be left alone … Is it normal? Will disappearing help? [/INST]  My suggestion would be to keep your eyes on the prize. Disappearing takes time away from your goal. This is a time in your life when you want to start attaining goals that you have set for yourself and completing your work at the University sounds like the most important thing in front of you. You want to be thinking about your needs and goals and prioritizing your own self care.What also seems clear for right now is that these two relationships became overwhelming for you emotionally. This may not be the best timing in life to try and balance a serious relationship with your studies.I would set my priorities so that you can accomplish your goal of completing your work at the university. After that you may want to look for more intimate connection with someone.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve had anxiety attacks since middle school. I have no idea why. I could be having the most amazing time and I could break down. I’ve also had some suicidal thoughts. It happened in the end of eighth grade then stopped then now they come and go. I want to tell my mom I want help with it but she’ll say she can help cause she’s a psychiatrist but I want someone else but I don’t know how to tell her I want actual help from someone I don’t know. My anxiety takes over my times I’m having fun or times I’m trying to sleep. I never know when it will happen or why. [/INST]  You are assuming that your mother will suggest that she act as your therapist but perhaps not. Most mental health professionals recognize the problems inherent with treating family members.

"<s>[INST] My mom teaches at a private school and one of her students kept fighting with others. She asked me to go talk to him so I did. The more I talked to him the more signs of being a psychopath began to show. He claimed he had no remorse for hurting people. And he said calmly that he thought another kid was going to beat him up (A kid who I know personally would never do anything like that) and so he said he had to kill him. That kind of scared me but I made no comment in an attempt to not discourage him from talking to me. I talked to him some more and I remembered that previously I had heard about some kids thinking that only weak people care about others. So I asked him if he thought that was true and he said yes. I asked him if his mom cared about him (which I know that she does, I’m friends with her) and he said yes. I asked him if that meant she was weak and he said yes. He then continued to say that he would like his mom more if she didn’t fake committing suicide, which from the way he told it, sounding like she was going to commit suicide then stopped because she realized that would leave him and his 4 year old sister parent-less. (His father isn’t in the picture.The reason behind this is unknown. He believes he’s never met his father.) I attempted to explain that she just really cared about him and that she didn’t want him to end up living with people that were mean to him. I asked him if he would like living with people that were mean to him and he calmly replied, “I wouldn’t care. They’d probably have knives and I’d kill them.” I asked if he knew that when people died in real life they didn’t come back to life and he said that of course he knew that. He went on to say that he enjoyed hurting people. I knew that he couldn’t hurt me much so I told him that if he liked hurting people so much he could hurt me. So he hit me then burst into tears. I think he’s pretty far down the wrong track but still has hope. How do I help him? [/INST]  While I appreciate your caring and effort and concern this is NOT something that you can or should be helping with. This sounds serious and important and at 15 years old you trying to help may be dangerous — and not what he needs. Don’t get me wrong here. Your sensitivity is genuine and wonderful, but he is talking about killing people, a mother with suicidal tendencies and when he was invited to hurt you he did. As much as I appreciate your desire to help, it isn’t what either of you need.Explain to your mom that you tried to talk and you think his needs are going to be much more than what you can do to help.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  I’m an 18yr old high school drop out. I’ve suffered from mental abuse since I was around three..but now that I can actually get out on my own, I can’t because my stepdad has trapped me. I guess I’ll start from the beginning. I’ve never met my biological father. My mom had left him when I wasn’t even a year old yet. When I was two, almost three, my mom starting dating my stepdad. They got a place together and eventually got married when I was around six. My stepdad has mentally & phisically abused me. When I was little, I was a skinny, entergetic, little girl. Then my stepdad decided I wasn’t eating enough so he started making me eat more food at dinner then he could. Half the time my mom would wait til he left the kitchen then throw it away, then they’d fight about it all the time. They fought alot over how he treated us kids. one time he hit me in the head with a plastic baseball bat my dog chewed up and cut y head open. My mom left him for like three days then we were back. Stuff like this continued until I was 13, then they got a divorce. [/INST]  You are right. What you are describing is abuse and neglect. None of the so-called adults in your life seem very adult at all. I’m worried for you. I’m worried for your little half-sister. It must feel to you like there is nowhere to turn. Going back to your stepdad doesn’t feel like an option but you don’t see others.At 18, you no longer qualify for help from CPS, it’s true. But you can probably get help from the local domestic violence program. The phone number for the Family Crisis Intervention Center is 304-428-2333 or 1-800-794-2335. There also appears to be a food pantry and a homeless shelter within 20 miles of your town. Often such places have counselors on site who can help you figure out where to get the supports you need. Meanwhile, if you need someone to talk to, call the Boys and Girls Town Hotline at 800-448-3000. Counselors are available 24/7 to help young people like yourself.I’m so very sorry you didn’t get the kind of family every child deserves to have. But you don’t have to accept your stepdad’s judgment of you. Therre is so much more to you than being a “high school dropout.” Your letter shows that you have a core of strength in you that you can build on once you are more on your own.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am curious about the amnesia part of DID. I seem to have different people who live inside me. Unlike what I know about DID, though, we all know about each other. We don’t always but occasionally we do talk to each other. I might comfort the child that is sad or the watchful one might tell me their impression of someone. We don’t forget what’s going on when one of the others is controlling the body. For instance, when I feel threatened or insulted a stronger person will stand in. I don’t disappear or anything I just seem to switch awareness into someone that has a different way of thinking, feeling, and behaving. [/INST]  From such a short letter it is difficult to determine if PTSD is the correct diagnosis. It very well may be but dissociative identity disorder (DID) is also a realistic possibility. It is not uncommon for individuals to have both DID and PTSD. In fact, some studies have shown that among individuals diagnosed with DID, the majority have a secondary diagnosis of PTSD.According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) for mental health disorders the diagnostic criteria for a DID diagnosis includes:(1) the presence of two or more identities; (2) at least two of these identities recurrently take control of the person’s behavior; and (3) having an inability to recall personal information. Your specific symptoms include having no memory of your childhood; a history of severe abuse; a recognition of other possible personalities (often referred to as identity alteration); and time loss experiences. Generally speaking, your symptoms are in line with a DID diagnosis.I would strongly encourage you to be evaluated by someone who has experience treating dissociative disorders or trauma. One of the main difficulties with DID, and dissociative disorders in general, is that individuals may be experiencing symptoms they are not fully aware of. This is why it is important to seek outside assistance from trained mental health professionals. It would also be beneficial to educate yourself about DID. A quick Amazon.com or Barnes & Noble search could help you to identify helpful resources.While I cannot offer a reliable diagnosis over the Internet, I do believe that dissociative disorder is a possibility. A psychiatric evaluation is the quickest strategy for determining an accurate diagnosis and more importantly to guide you to effective treatments. I wish you the best of luck.

"<s>[INST] I really want to run away from home (I’m 18 yo) because of my toxic family. I really feel like I’m on the edge from just going insane because I feel helpless/hopeless. I’m someone who is forced to be isolated and I have low self-esteem/poor confidence from what I believe is emotional abuse from my childhood. The people I live with are belittling and make me feel bad about myself. They’re the reason I have low self-esteem issues and I feel worthless/incapable. I want to defend myself but I don’t know how to cause I’m scared to and I’m honestly not used to defending myself. It’s even come to the place where I might have to physically defend myself. Can you please advise me on what I should do to build my confidence and courage so I can stand up for myself? What should I do about wanting to run away from home even though I have nowhere to go, but sometimes home really makes me want to snap? (From the USA) [/INST] Thank you for writing to us. In spite of all their belittling and emotional abuse there is an invincible and unbelievably strong part of you that had the courage to write this email. The part of you that knows the situation you’re in isn’t healthy and has your best interest at heart is the part we want to honor. Don’t let go of this feeling of the need to take care of yourself. It may be difficult, but it is the healthiest part of you and we want to recognize that it is alive and well and needs to be nurtured.You need to plan. A plan for your independence and living out and away from your dysfunctional families influence. The work for you right now is to look at your options. Whatever they are they need to lead you out and away from this house. Look at all possibilities. Perhaps it is time to join the Armed Forces, go back to school, or take a job where you can live more independently out and away from your family. The first part of the plan is to deeply investigate what are your options. The second part will be to act on them.The sooner you can do this the better, but give yourself a deadline. Will it be three months? Six months? A year? You need to motivate yourself toward the goal of getting out by making that the most important goal in front of you.One of the most effective forms of goal setting comes from what is known as S-M-A-R-T Goals. This acronym stands for Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Realistic, Timely. I am advocating for you to start planning goals for yourself that use this formula.The feeling of wanting to run away from home is a powerful one, but usually people who run don’t have a good enough plan to sustain themselves. If we are using the above method the first thing is to begin with a specific goal in mind. It could be to move out, it could be to save two thousand dollars, it might be to contact the woman’s shelter in your county for counseling. Whatever the goal make it clear and specific.Secondly, make sure this goal is measurable. A goal that says “I don’t want this to keep happening” is neither specific nor measurable. A goal that says I want to move out within a year and save 40 dollars a week so I can pay the deposit and the first month’s rent is both specific AND measurable.To make a goal actionable means you need to be able to do something toward it. The action, in this case, might be to get a job, or open up a savings account, or start looking at the cost of apartments or start talking to people who have done it. Goals must be something we are taking action on to achieve.The realistic part is essential. You don’t want to establish a goal like: “I’m moving into my own apartment next week,” if there isn’t any resources or opportunity for that to happen. Of course, what is realistic is something that can change one way or another with a shift in circumstances, but when you establish the goal make it one you can reach.Finally, pick a timeline that is reasonable and can keep you motivated. “I want to move out within ten years,” won’t help. A goal that is too quick would lead to failure and defeat. Make the goal something you’ll have to stretch for but not something that robs you of the engagement necessary to stay motivated to achieve it.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  Ok so I’m 15 and I snuck my bf over while my mom was at work and had sex. Stupid decision, I know. So I told my best friend and her mom was going through her phone and saw it. My mom was talking to my Bestfriends mom the other day and my mom was telling me that her mom was implying that I had a boy over but not being direct. My mom asked me and I told her no, only BC I was caught off guard and afraid! I really need to tell my mom before my friend’s mom does but I just don’t know how to. I am afraid of her reaction and I just don’t have the guts. This has really been bothering me and it’s all I worry about! I need help! ASAP! [/INST]  I agree. That really wasn’t the smartest thing you’ve ever done. Why are you having sex at 15 for starters?! Then there’s the breaking of a house rule and lying to your mom. Whew!Someone once said, “When all else fails, tell the truth.” You already know that whatever the consequences may be, it will be much worse if your mother hears what’s gone on from someone else. If you can’t get up the courage to tell her directly, write her a note or give her your letter and this response and then stick around to talk about it.Trust is a very fragile thing. Once it is broken, it takes a long time and exemplary behavior to win it back. The beginning is to admit the wrongdoing, apologize, and take the consequences. That probably means you’ll be grounded for awhile and that your mother will be extra vigilant. The best way to show your maturity is to accept it without protest and to be the best you know how to be.And while you are grounded, I hope you will think about what was the rush to have sex. Most girls your age don’t and for good reasons. At 15, I doubt you are ready to manage the emotions and vulnerability that go with sexual intimacy. Then there’s the reality that sex can make babies. A person who can’t face her own mom isn’t ready to be a mother herself. If you have some idea that it is necessary to keep a boyfriend, think again. Any boy worth loving isn’t going to pressure you. Instead of falling into bed, I hope you will find other ways to get to know each other and to enjoy each other’s company. You’ll be an adult for the rest of your life. Really. There’s no hurry.I wish you well.  </s>"

"<s>[INST] My relationship with my boyfriend has been destroyed by his mental illness. He has no official diagnosis, but bipolar runs in his family and he displays numerous symptoms of seemingly multiple disorders. One unofficial diagnosis by a physician was bipolar with schizoaffective disorder. [/INST]  Your boyfriend is not well. He’s clearly symptomatic. As you said, he’s angry, paranoid and the majority of his delusions involve you. He’s convinced that you are cheating on him despite there being no evidence to support his belief. I believe that this puts you in potential danger. Generally speaking, people with severe mental illnesses are no more dangerous than people without severe mental illnesses; however, the violence risk level increases under certain conditions. These conditions can include: the use of drugs or alcohol, refusing to participate in treatment and not taking medication.Having a history of violence also increases the possibility of future violence.He may never harm you but the violence risk is elevated when psychosis is present. Individuals who are psychotic may do things that they would never normally do if they were not psychotic.I understand that you feel guilty about “abandoning him” but that’s not what you would be doing. He is unable to function in a healthy relationship when he is actively psychotic. Thus, until your boyfriend agrees to participate in treatment, you and he cannot have a functioning relationship.Urge him to seek treatment. Do everything you can to convince him that it is the right thing to do. If he is unconvinced and still refuses treatment, then remove yourself from the situation until he changes his mind. If he is a danger to himself or you believe that you may be in danger, contact the authorities. You can’t force him to seek treatment but you should do everything in your power to convince him to seek help. Please take care. </s>"

After 9 months I’m really struggling to find the love in the relationship. One month ago I did something awful to her that was related with my PTSD, and now I’m just trying to pick up the pieces because of guilt.

There are a lot of fights and daily depression that effects both our lives heavily. I guess, I’m trying to figure out if I should break up with her because the BPD has become too overwhelming and manipulative. I can’t even play guitar anymore because she thinks that me learning will compromise her identity that has latched onto her guitar skills. All of my hobbies are now competitions in her mind. I love her extremely, but all of this daily drama is killing us. I think it just comes down to figuring out if there is a future for us anymore.

I only talk to people when I am forced to, such as class group assignments or extracurricular activities. There is only one person that I am willing to talk to — my boyfriend. [/INST]  You are choosing to talk to just one person. You described yourself as “slowly drifting away from friends and classmates” partially because you lack motivation because of sadness and loneliness.

"<s>[INST] From India: Hello, I’m a 15 year old girl and lately I’ve been having these mixed up feelings all the time. I don’t know what do I exactly feel but it always pricks me, makes me want to cry and then it leads to making me feel useless because whatever I try to do ends up wrong. Whatever situation I try to handle turns out more messed up. I just feel I’m good for nothing. My friends probably don’t care about me. I just keep feeling lonely all the time. I need someone to care for me, someone to understand me. I’ve tried making friends but whenever I just start trusting them, they tend to break it. No matter wherever I go or to whosoever I talk to I keep feeling lonely, I keep feeling that I want to cry. I just don’t know why is this?It has never been like this before. These feelings have developed all of a sudden and it doesn’t let me concentrate on anything not even my studies. What can I possibly do to get these feelings out? [/INST]  Thank you for writing. Adolescence can be a confusing time. What you are probably experiencing are the changes in emotions that are a normal part of development in the teen years. Your body is changing. Your hormones are shifting you into womanhood. Some girls go through this time more easily than others. Some, maybe like you, are more sensitive and feel things more deeply.As for your friendships: I wonder how many are feeling the same kind of confusing feelings you are. It may be that everyone is afraid to talk about it so everyone ends up feeling alone and like there is something wrong with them. Maybe it would help if you opened up to a friend or two about who difficult it sometimes is to manage your emotions. It’s just possible they will be relieved to be able to share as well.If you feel your emotions are truly more intense than other girls’, please make an appointment to see your doctor. If things are difficult, but normal, you will get that reassurance from your doctor. If there is something amiss, your doctor will help you understand your options for managing it.In my many years as a psychologist, I’ve found that the teens who best manage these years are those who get involved in something they care about where they can work cooperatively with other teens. This could be a sport team, a theater group, a band, or a service project of some sort. When people work side by side with each other to reach a goal, the focus is on the goal, not on each other. That takes the pressure off the relationships. Friendships often evolve naturally as people get to know each other better. Give it a try.In the meantime, make sure you are getting 8 hours of sleep a night, that you are eating a healthy diet and that you are getting some exercise every day. Your body is growing and changing and needs that care. A healthy body will help you have a healthy mind and spirit as well.I wish you well.  </s>"

Why can’t he understand this and back off and respect this fact? we have sex quite frequently.. but when I don’t feel like it one time or another he flips out and yells or gets violent.. Is this normal? [/INST] A. He gets angry because he feels rejected. Sex is apparently very important to him either physiologically or psychologically. In essence his feelings are hurt and rather than to show you his weakness and the fact that he is hurt it is much easier for him to show you his anger. Some people consider sex to be more than sex. They consider it to be some validation of themselves or a validation of the solidity of their relationship. Apparently, he feels that way. He certainly acts as if he is being rejected. He needs to change his behavior. Few couples are perfectly compatible sexually. One will want sex more than the other in almost every case. He has to learn to adjust to this. You have to learn to make sure you meet a reasonable need of his but he can’t expect you to meet 100% of his sexual desire. He needs to be realistic. If I were your therapist I would asking you about whether or not the two of you discuss masturbation or find it acceptable in your relationship. A mode of his finding sexual release with a minimal involvement from you might be the answer. I hope this all works out. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m an American and I recently got married to an Irish man, he’s almost 26. I recently found out that a week after our wedding I found out he’d been looking at sexy fb pics of a 16 yr. old girl that was at our wedding (the daughter of a close friend of his families) as well as pics of other local 14, 15 year old girls. Upon looking at his fb search history I found at that before meeting me he’d frequented this girl’s page. His last gf was 17 and I found correspondence between them where he stated that he found sleeping with underage girls exciting. [/INST]  What a sad and disturbing thing to discover after your wedding. I’m so, so sorry. You must be angry and confused and terribly disappointed. From your description of the situation, I do think you are right to be concerned.You are absolutely correct that it is very wrong for your husband to be attracted to underage girls and to be seeking them out. He knows it too. First, he hid his interest from you and now he justifies it. I don’t know anything about Irish law, but even if it isn’t illegal to look at pictures of the young teens, I imagine that their parents would be upset and furious if they knew. The kids may not have good judgment about what they are putting on FB but he is a 26 year old man. Mature men help keep a community safe. They don’t contribute to the sexualization of children and teens by adults.The most hopeful sign is his willingness to go to therapy. I also think it will be important for you to be included in some of his sessions. You will need reassurance that he is able to make a fundamental change in his sexual interest for you to trust him and for the two of you to ever have a satisfying intimate relationship and a successful marriage.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Taiwan: I used to live in one country, and it didn’t have opportunities for my career so I relocated. But in that country, I could go outside and easily find my “type” of girl I’m attracted to. It gave me motivation to improve myself as a man, and hope of finding my type of girl. It made me feel alive. [/INST]  I agree. The problem is in the mind, not in the people you are meeting. It’s interesting to me that you have created an idea that you can have either career opportunities or attractive women. In your former country, you got affirmation from the pursuit of women. In this country, you get satisfaction from work. This is simply not a reasonable position.I suspect that you are having a more difficult time adjusting to your new country than you are admitting. It’s possible that you have compartmentalized your anxiety and uncertainties into this one issue. By “blaming” other people for not being your type, you avoid having to deal with your own lack of confidence. Perhaps?I think your feelings are telling you that, at 30, it’s time for you to bring your work life and your social life into balance. There are beautiful people everywhere. Look beyond your prejudices. Pursuing your “type” didn’t result in finding a life partner. It’s probably time you changed your criteria.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I know that you cannot do a diagnosis online. I am concerned i might have schizophrenia or OCD. I often talk to myself, but i do not hear voices or anything of that nature. I admit i do not have a lot of friends. I live in a state with out family, so i tend to feel lonely a lot, and depressed, although, i am not suicical. I tend to obsess over things a lot and worry about things a lot. I also tend to rub my hands together a lot. I know I need to go in and see a doctor, and possibly was thinking of getting on Prozac, or Zoloft. I was hoping you could tell me if the signs i am showing are signs of schizophrenia, or something else. Thank you for your time. Have a great day. [/INST]  Based on the limited information that was provided it does not seem as though you are exhibiting symptoms of schizophrenia. Individuals with schizophrenia hear voices, have hallucinations and believe in things that are not real (delusions). You stated that you do not hear voices. You often talk to yourself but many people, if asked, might also report doing the same. They may not literally talk to themselves out loud or in public but having an ongoing running dialogue “in their head” is quite normal.Your symptoms seem more in line with an anxiety or depressive disorder. Rubbing one’s hands together is not a specific symptom of any particular mental health disorder but it may be a sign of anxiety. It may also be a sign of a specific type of anxiety disorder called obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).Depression is also a possibility. You report feeling lonely and depressed. Depression and anxiety disorders commonly co-occur. This means that many people who have one often have the other. They tend to go hand in hand.I am glad that you recognize the need to see a doctor. Having a psychiatric evaluation is what is needed. It is the first step in understanding the problem and accessing the appropriate treatment.Cognitive behavioral therapy is currently one of the best treatment approaches for depression and anxiety. Many mental health professionals advocate adding an anti-anxiety or antidepressant medication as an adjunct to therapy. Combining therapy and medication is a comprehensive approach for the treatment of many mental health disorders. I hope that you are able to receive the help that you want. I wish you the best. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, I’m 33 and I’ve been with my psychotherapist for almost 10 years. She’s caring and insightful. When I talk about my own issues related to problems such as self-esteem and impulsiveness I often gain a great deal of understanding about myself. My issue occurs when I talk about problems involving others, in those cases she almost always gives the other person the benefit of the doubt. Here are some examples: a coworker and I had plans but she never answered the phone. I noticed that at 3am she posted, “having a great time” on facebook. A friend responded with a wink. She had been dating a coworker who also posted on his own page about having fun while out at the same time. When I confronted my coworker about standing me up she said she said she had awoken at that hour and posted that but had not been out. Clearly she was lying, but my therapist said it was possible she was being honest. Another example, a guy I dated texted me on a Wednesday about doing something over the weekend. I asked him what day but he never responded till Sunday telling me he had been sick. My therapist again posited he could have been honest. Another example: my sister was attracted to a guy I dated and commented that he must be really into me since he never checked her out. My sister and I have had lifelong issues about her demeaning me about my looks. My therapist saw nothing wrong with her catty comments. I felt so frustrated with my therapist doing this, not always but often, I’ve threatened to quit. First she responded that I negatives situations and she had been trying to help me with that approach. She’s big on my having “evidence” about situations before I make an assumption. This issue has nagged me so long, she finally said she would be mindful and try not to do it. I feel rage and resentment towards her at not being there for me when I’ve been legitimately upset with others. Also, I feel she’s being manipulative when she says if I quit to go to another therapist, the same issue will persist and so we need to work out our differences together. It’s true that I have tendencies to drop people instead of working out differences, but I’ve been with her for a long time, so I’m not certain the same issue applies here. I don’t trust her judgment and wonder if she’s super naïve or contrarian as a matter of course. I have anxiety when mentioning issues with others assuming she will automatically side with them. Do you think it’s time to get a new therapist or is it possible to move past this? I feel very attached to her but I’m not sure if it’s because we’ve been together so long, or because of her good traits. [/INST]  Thank you for allowing me to respond to your concerns. What I find so interesting about your letter is that it seems to me you are feeling towards the therapist what you have been feeling toward others. Therapy, particularly in long-term therapy, it is common for some of the feelings that you are wrestling with outside to come into the therapy room. Your sentence: ‘I feel rage and resentment towards her at not being there for me when I’ve been legitimately upset,’ seems to merit exactly what you experienced in each of your vignettes. The coworker, your sister, and the guy you dated are all people you had a legitimate gripe with, and you have resentment toward them when they weren’t there for you when you were legitimately upset. In other words I think it’s time for you to talk to your therapist about the commonality of these feelings. The therapeutic environment can allow you to encounter this issue with your therapist with the hope of working it through.My experience is that when there is such a powerful pull to leave, it is probably time to see how the issue in therapy reflects issues in your life.Of course, if you do this and don’t feel it is resolvable or workable with your therapist then you may want to move on. But my strong suggestion is to bring all this forward first.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I think I’ve been depressed a long time, and providing self-therapy without knowing it, and it’s not enough. I’ve been told that depression runs in my family, though my mother’s never specifically told me who has it (and my extended family isn’t close enough for me to figure that out myself) and I’m afraid I may be too. It started early in high school. Hanging out with other people wasn’t appealing, I didn’t want to join any clubs, at lunch I sat with people I knew marginally just so as not to sit alone. Mind you, plenty of people tried to be my friend and I just wasn’t open to it. I was very self-conscious about my looks until about last year, when I got my first boyfriend, and now it just marginally haunts me; however, I know, if we broke up, I would still have that confidence regardless. People in my family are very smart and successful (doctors, scientists, lawyers…) and though I have my own talents I can’t seem to show them. Working at all feels so difficult. I used to be active and now it mentally hurts and is so strenuous to exercise. Occasionally I’ll feel normal and it feels so amazing to not hurt at all. Sometimes I’ll go beyond that and just do, do, do- clean everything, write essays, write short stories- but that only happens up to 3 times a year max. Much more often I sink into awful depression where I cry for hours without reason (about once or twice every 2 months, more in the winter and summer). [/INST]  I would concur with your assessment that your attempts to help yourself “[aren’t] cutting it.” The proof is that your depression symptoms remain present. I admire your continued efforts to help yourself but it is important to recognize when those attempts are not working and to be willing to seek help from a professional. The latter should be your next step.It’s not clear from your letter why you are reluctant to seek help. You might fundamentally believe that asking for help is a sign of weakness or that you “should” be able to solve your own problems. That type of mindset can be self-destructive in that it often leads to prolonged suffering. It is also an inefficient approach to problem-solving.In the American culture, many people find it perfectly acceptable to seek medical attention when they are experiencing physical health symptoms. That same logic should be applied in cases of mental health symptoms.It is obvious that you are suffering. You can begin to end your suffering by seeing a mental health professional. Virtually all college campuses have mental health professionals on staff to help their students. I would advise that you make an appointment as soon as possible with a mental health professional. Seeking professional help would be the most efficient and responsible way to handle your situation. I hope that you agree with my assessment and are able to receive the help that you deserve. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] So I’ve got a friend, she’s nice, friendly, and we enjoy the same topics. The problem is that she has depression. She’s constantly ragging on herself and her work and doesn’t believe anything good I say about her. I’ve suggested therapy but she’s stubborn as a rock. My other friend tried to give her a session with our school’s counselor/psychiatrist but she continuously refused and told us that we didn’t understand’ and she was never going to tell anyone her problems’. Quick note: I used to have depression and was sent to a therapist to recover. I mentioned that I had been in her place and knew how she felt. She wouldn’t listen and threatened not being our friend if we didn’t cancel that session. I’m guessing that was because it was in the school and she didn’t want her bullies finding out. I suggested to her therapy with an actual therapist but she refused because her mom would kill her’. How am I supposed to get her mom to help her with her problems? We’re only fifth graders so there’s nothing I can really do, unfortunately… can you help me help her? [/INST] This problem is best handled by adults. Inform your parents about what’s going on. You should also inform her parents about what’s going on. Your parents might want to do this on their own or with you. Your friend might be angry with you, but her parents need to know that something is wrong.Another strategy is for you to report what you know about your friend to the school counselor/psychiatrist. School officials should also be aware that she has “bullies.” Many schools have systematic approaches for dealing with the problem of bullying. Again, your friend might be upset with you but it is important to do the right thing even if it’s difficult.There is nothing else you can do except call emergency services if she becomes a danger to herself or to others. Otherwise, you’ve done all you can.There may be many reasons why your friend is reluctant to seek help. Unfortunately, you can’t make people do things they don’t want to do. That is a difficult lesson to learn.Generally speaking, do all you can, and realize that’s all anyone can ask of you. I’m impressed with your efforts to help your friend and hope that everything turns out well for all involved. Thank you for your question please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Well it happened a few weeks ago. I was the best man for a wedding so I threw a bachelor party. I ended up sharing a hotel room with the groom. After a long night of drinking we got back to the room. He started to open up and tell me things. He told me he had feelings for me and not just sexual. I though that just because he was drunk that it meant nothing. But the next morning he came and snuggled on my bed and then we kissed and then fooled around. He got married a week later I was right by his side and it was kinda hard but I wanted him to be happy. We have not talked about what happened and I do not want to make it something bigger than it is. He has been with her for 7 years. I am afraid he will soon have a break down he keeps things bottled up what should I do. I am also kinda been on an emotional roller coaster with what happened going from sad, to happy to angry. what makes it worse is I work with him and we act like nothing happened it is eating me up inside and I’m confused. [/INST]  I can understand why you are confused about the situation.  You mentioned that you’re afraid that your friend will soon have a breakdown. It’s curious to me that you seem more concerned about him that about your own well-being. We have no idea what’s going on in your friend’s mind, so at this point, all I have to work with is how you’re going to handle this.While your friend expressed that he had feelings for you during that brief window of time, his choice to marry his fiance speaks pretty clearly about what he wants in the long run. I can only imagine how it is extremely awkward at work to have this intimate exchange at the bachelor party and then not process the experience and come to some understanding of what it means.I think it’s really important for you to get clear on what you want to happen next. What do you want in order to get off of the “emotional roller coaster”? What would your relationship with him look like right now? Once you’ve clarified what you want to have happen, I think it would be helpful to have a brief conversation with your friend about the incident, come to an understanding about what it means to your friendship, and decide together how you’d like things to go from here.If your friend is unwilling to talk with you, or if you talk and continue to feel confused and distressed, I recommend that you seek some psychotherapy to help you work through your emotions. Thanks for writing in and I wish you the best in this difficult situation.Take good care of yourself!Julie Hanks, LCSW </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m writing about this problem because I don’t know if my mother is actually abusive or if what I’m experiencing is just normal. My mother is always blaming me for her feelings. She never apologizes or admits that she is wrong. When I ask her to apologize she becomes mad and starts telling me how disrespectful I am and how many things she does for me. Most of these things are to manipulate me and to try and make my point invalid when I say she is a bad mother. Even though I often pay for these things myself. She never holds a promise or keeps something a secret. In front of other people, she likes to show how inferior I am to her and how much power over me she has (especially when she is drunk). She insults, criticizes and dismisses my opinions, beliefs, friends and interests. When my mother is mad, she always takes it out on me. She drinks almost every day but I don’t think she qualifies as an alcoholic. She doesn’t abuse me physically (even though she used to hit me until the age of 12) but it shows when she wants to. When I was supposed to get taken away from my family at one point, she said that I can just go away. When she found out I was cutting, she was really really mad and blamed everything on me and insulted even though the main reason I was cutting was because of her. My mother wants to know everything about my life but she gets mad when I tell her that I don’t want to talk to her. She doesn’t respect my boundaries and doesn’t care about me being unhappy. She don’t consider ‘no’ as an answer. Why I am doubting my situation, is because I never tried to make my mother happy. I always thought “she never tries to make me happy, so why would I try to live up to her standards?” and “I don’t care if my mother is going to be mad. I will never be good enough for her anyways” but I never actually caused major trouble in school or at home. Maybe I didn’t clean or take out the trash. But my mother always went insane if I didn’t do that. She never listens to me. Is she abusive? Or is it just my fault? (From Sweden) [/INST]  It isn’t just your fault. Thank you for taking the time to write us. Your mother’s drinking, personality, physical and emotional abuse of you are significant. Taken together it shows that the majority of the problem lies with her parenting skills — not you.I would start by talking to a trusted teacher or counselor at your school. He or she will be in the best position for offering suggestions about what to do next. As a 15 year old your mother needs to be doing a better job. Although you didn’t explain the situation in detail — if you were supposed to be taken away from your family because of your mother’s behavior you may want to contact the people recommending this — they may also be in a position to help.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] This is what i believe,i am going to a therapist soon, how should i bring this up? The Canadian government, and the RCMP are after me.There are camera’s in my house and room and microphones that are implemented in my clothes so that they can listen to what I am saying, they also have the power to listen in my mind and they know what I am thinking. Writing this is extremely hard because now they will know that I know. Whenever I go out they are always following me switching and people all the time. The guy sitting on the bench “reading” his newspaper, works for CSIS. If I go into a store they follow me in, I try to lose them but they will always find me. No where is safe. They are trying to leave me messages in patterns which I am still unable to understand. I clear my browsing history all the time and constantly make new social media profiles so it is harder for them to find me. They went my special powers. I don’t know yet what the powers are but it must be something big otherwise why would they care? This is really hard, i don’t want to let them win but i want to stay away from me. I think they are trying to control my mind and brainwash me because there are so many things I forget in the short term for example I couldn’t remember what we had had for dinner just a few days before when it came up in conversation, i think they are also trying to talk to me because I’ve been hearing a voice, I have only been able to tell what they are saying a few times: they asked me: Why are you whispering? In a terrible and scary voice which didn’t seem to have a gender, It sounded like a loud whisper. I have also heard them say what now? But this time is wasn’t at all scary and I was a women voice. I also think that my dad is trying to kill me poison me by putting things into my food but the reason I dont die is cause I have an extremely good resistant rate to the poison. I also feel things, generally its stuff like animals brushing up my leg or bugs landing on my skin [/INST]  Yes. You should tell your therapist everything you have written in this letter. This is exactly the type of information they need to know. Your therapist might also recommend medication, in addition to therapy, to treat your symptoms. Both therapy and perhaps medication can eliminate these problems.You might be experiencing paranoia and related symptoms, but they are treatable. The more information you can provide to your therapist, the more specific and targeted your treatment plan will be.In the meantime, do your best to stay grounded in reality. Challenge your beliefs and insist on proof. For instance, you wrote that the Canadian government is after you but what proof do you have? Finding proof can be difficult because mental illness confuses and tricks you into believing something that is not real. It’s important to challenge your beliefs, demand proof but most importantly, get help from professionals. They will know how to help you. They will teach you to identify false realities.Hopefully you have trusted friends or relatives who can help you to feel safe and supported. If not, your therapist will fill those gaps. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.K.: The main issue that made me think I might have some problems is my incapacity to cry. I don’t even remember last time it happened (maybe more than 10 years ago). I never lose myself in memories and I am able to end a relationship (friends or partners) and never think again about them. [/INST]  It looks to me like you have a very long history of coping with conflict by distancing yourself from your feelings. Unfortunately, you didn’t figure out how to hold onto the positive feelings while you banished the anxiety and negative ones. It’s as if you thought/felt that you needed to switch off your feelings in order to survive. Your sexual dysfunction and your inability to feel loss are an outcome. At this point, you don’t know how to (or don’t feel safe enough to) turn the feelings switch back on.I suppose you could live out your life this way, but I do think you deserve better. If your could throw the feelings switch back on by yourself you would have done so already. I therefore do recommend that you see a therapist. With the support and advice of a good therapist, you can reconnect with your feelings and have a more satisfying life.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I took your sanity test and got a 50 in dissociation, 50 in PSTD, 69 in depression, and 70 in anxiety. I listed these results specifically because I know that these are symptoms of DID. Now, I am very forgetful, short term and long term when it comes to events, not with information though. That I feel others hold for me and give it to me when needed. I experience visual and auditory hallucinations, both internal and external. I also experience depersonalization and derealization, meaning that I feel that the world around me is not real. I have many out-of-body experiences and trances and moments where I feel I’m watching myself from afar. I feel that I have a minimal awareness of me shifting personality states in different situations. For example, a more social personality for communicating, a more confident one for presenting, and so on. I also have a lot of identity confusion where I feel like a boy some days and a girl others. I call myself transgender, but that does not seem to fit. The voices I hear are always either commenting or conversing and I am able to speak back. I also feel like my thoughts, feelings, behaviors are not always my own. [/INST]  Thank you for writing. This sounds very, very hard. You and I both know that whatever is going on with you is very, very complicated. You’ve made some reasonable guesses, but it is unlikely that you have all those diagnoses. Although I understand that naming what is wrong may be comforting, it isn’t by itself necessarily going to help you feel better. I think it would be more helpful at this point for you to see a mental health professional to narrow things down and to develop a treatment plan. You don’t have to live with all this confusion, depression and pain.Taking the quizzes and writing to us here at PsychCentral is a courageous and important start. I hope you will go the next step and find a therapist to help you heal.

"<s>[INST] I’m 19 and my brother 17.We used to share a really good bond.He was my best friend until he began doing this and now i almost hate him. [/INST]  I am so very glad you wrote. Please don’t feel guilty about your reaction. It is very common for people who are being assaulted to freeze. This is especially true when the abuser is bigger and stronger and has already shown that he is capable of physical aggression. You can’t fight him. All you can do is detach from yourself.Make no mistake: What your brother is doing is a crime. He is sexually abusing you. It is not normal. It is not okay for him to take advantage of you if you have to sleep in the same room. He continues assaulting you because he can get away with it. He has already tried to have sex with you and will do so again. Stop it now before it gets even worse.You really do have to tell your parents. I’m sure they won’t want to believe it. No parent wants to believe that their son could actually sexually abuse his sister. It is understandable that they would rather think you are crazy. For some parents, crazy is better than criminal. But that doesn’t make their reaction okay. They need to protect you. In fact, they need to protect both their children: You from being raped by your brother; your brother from going to jail.Take care of yourself. Before you have the conversation, arrange for a friend to be with you to give you support. Write out what you want to tell them. If words fail you, you can hand them your letter. Do not have the conversation with your brother present. He will of course deny it and try to make it look like it is your fault. You don’t need to deal with that.If your parents call you names or try to make you retract your statement, you need to stay calm and simply tell them they have to stop it or you will go to the police. If your parents persist in not believing you, then go to the police and stay with your friend until your parents send your brother away. You cannot safely live in the same house with him. He is likely to try to get even with you for telling.Abusers can only continue abuse as long as everyone keeps their secret. You have a right to be furious. You have a right to protect yourself! If your parents handle this as they should, there is no need for you to have a negative reputation. Even if the story does get out, you can hold your head up with pride because you refused to be victimized.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I take invega shot and pill as well as lamictal for schizoaffective disorder. I am wondering why I have seconds of self-talk or talking out loud. Is this med supposed to stop everything or will there be moments like those seconds? It happens once a day. I sometimes say things that didn’t really happen or that I don’t mean. Does this mean that the med has failed? And if so are there other med options. [/INST] This is an impossible question to answer without a full treatment history. Thus, my answer can offer only general information.Self-talk and talking to oneself out loud are fairly common behaviors. People often worry that it means that there’s something wrong with them. Usually, that is not the case, especially when it’s done in private.People are probably talking to themselves, silently, much of the time. Some people find that it helps them to stay grounded. Others have said that it helps to clarify their thinking.You also mentioned that you “say things that didn’t really happen or that you don’t mean.” Again, out of context and without more information, it’s difficult to know what that means.I would recommend asking these questions to your treating professional. They would be in the best position to answer your questions since they know you personally.Psychiatric medications often remove many symptoms but may not remove all. If you find that a medication is not working well enough, because you continue to experience significant symptoms, then an adjustment is likely necessary.Time is also a factor. It can take weeks or months before you feel the full effect of any medication.It’s common for people to try multiple medications, or different dosages of medications, to find the right fit. The more feedback you provide your prescribing physician, the easier it will be to find a medication that works for you.There are also other injectable forms of antipsychotic medication you could research and discuss with your doctor. Risperdal, for instance, also comes as an injection.Finding the right medication is often a process of trial and error. It requires patience on the part of both the patient and treating physician. Hopefully, you’ll find something that works for you. Thanks for your question. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.:I don’t have a maternal instinct toward babies. I can’t even confidentially say I find them cute. Whenever I’m around kids I feel uncomfortable. I don’t know how to act around them or bring myself down to their level. I can’t do baby talk and I can’t talk simply enough for them to understand me. [/INST]  I wish I could be helpful, but I don’t think I have enough information. If you don’t have younger siblings or have never babysat or been around small children, it’s no wonder that you aren’t comfortable around them. Working and playing with young children is a learned skill. You have to have kids to learn on.Not everyone wants or needs to have children in their life. But in order to choose well, you need to explore the basis of your choice.At 19, I wouldn’t expect you to have “maternal” instincts. Although there are many young women who are ga-ga over babies, it’s also true that some don’t have an ounce of maternal interest until they are much older or they see their own child. Remember, the word is “maternal” which means mother. Often mothering feelings come about when a person becomes a mother.It’s also unusual for someone who is 19 to declare herself asexual. If I were seeing you, I’d ask you to explore your medical and psychological history with me to understand it. I’d also want to talk to you about your pessimism about ever finding someone who would love you and you would love in return.I do think that looking into these issues is important to your own growth. I hope you will contact a therapist and go to therapy for at least a few months to learn more about yourself.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve been seeing the best therapist I’ve ever worked with for almost three years and, in that time, he’s helped me significantly, including with coming out as trans and gay and gaining confidence to date and try out relationships. I’ve been on several dates with a great guy who is also trans and gay and we just discovered that we see the same therapist. I would say the chances were slim but my therapist is out as a queer man and many of his clients are queer. Additionally, as I’m out socializing more, trying new bars and parties, and meeting more people, I realize that my therapist and I will likely be running in similar circles. [/INST]  There are many reasonable and ethical ways to do therapeutic work. Some therapists refuse to see both romantic partners. Other therapists (like me) do so routinely.Your therapist is the only one that doesn’t know that he is seeing two members of a couple. That isn’t helpful. The best thing to do is for each of you to give him permission to talk to the other. Say something like, “I know that, due to confidentiality, you can’t confirm whether X is in treatment with you as well as me but we’re a couple. If he is, I want you to know that it’s okay with me for you to confirm with him that I am in treatment with you as well.” Once you each give him permission, he may want to see both of you in a session to figure out the best way to proceed.As you well know, the LGBTQ community in any area is often small and the number of therapists who self-identify is smaller still. As you pointed out, it is inevitable that you will have complicated connections with each other. The best way to deal with it is to acknowledge it and talk about how best to handle it before you run into problematic situations.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  Recently, my husband and I had to go out of town for a funeral. A friend of mine (let’s call her Inga) was scheduled to work, so I left her my car. My son called me late at night our first night away, and told me Inge hadn’t come home in my car yet. After 3 hours of trying to contact her, I finally got through. The car had run out of gas, and she was lost. After about 15 minutes of trying to get a straight answer of where she might be, she finally tells me the police were there with her. I had her put the officer on the phone and found out she’d gone 40 miles in the opposite direction to get home, had run out of gas and put oil in my car (thinking that was the problem), and my car was sitting in the middle of the road with a dead battery and no lights at night! The officer agreed to bring her home, and I would send my son the next day to retrieve my car. When my son went to see if he could fix my car, he found she’d put oil in the power steering pump! He spent $40 of his own money to fix the car and get it home. Inga texted me the following day, apologizing, and saying she’d pay for any damages. [/INST]  Your friend is lucky indeed to have as supportive and caring a friend as you are. But at this point, you are feeling taken advantage of. At 53, she isn’t going to be the one to step up and initiate change. You are going to have to either draw some clear boundaries and give her a deadline for leaving your home or you need to get busy and find her the services she needs.There are generic social services that can help your friend. Housing services and food stamps are a good first step. It may also be that she qualifies for other supports. If you think that she has below average intelligence or has a brain injury, for example, you could see if she qualifies for disability services.Your friend has somehow survived without you for years. Think about how she has managed. Has she gone from one good-hearted person like yourself to another? Or has she found ways to fend for herself when no one was willing to let her become dependent? If the latter is the case, then “tough love” may be the answer. If, however, she has usually ended up homeless and destitute, then the loving thing to do is to help her connect with social services.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My boyfriend and I been together for 3 years (we’re 22) and at the beginning of our relationship it was rocky but we gotten much better so I thought. My boyfriend’s career is a tattoo artist so he tattoos girls and guys in the most private places, but I dealt with that after all that’s how we met. However he flirts with these females and I don’t mean a glance or a hi, he texts them and is on social networks getting with these females asking them out to dinner, making sexual remarks, inviting them over to OUR house (we live together). He says things and wants to do things that he DOESNT do with me (he seems like he’s all talk and no action). [/INST]  This relationship is going nowhere. You don’t trust your boyfriend. He continues to give you reasons not to. He has an active fantasy life that goes beyond talk. He’s asking these women out to dinner and inviting them into your home.You aren’t blameless. Your response to his behavior is to cheat to get even. Obviously, it doesn’t work. Of more concern, it shows you to be as immature as he is. You then fall for it when he cries and you let yourself get talked into trying again. What a painful and pointless cycle. He lies. You cheat. He cries. You give in. And the whole thing goes around again.I suggest that you take responsibility for your part of this endless game and get out of it. Learn from your mistake. Make yourself available to someone who is ready and able to be in a committed relationship without all the drama.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] What do I do about my boyfriend and my mom? My mom doesn’t want me dating him but she hasn’t even met him. I have been with my boyfriend for about 6 months (end of this month) and my parents do not approve of this relationship. At first they were adamantly disapproving of my interracial relationship (I’m Korean dating a White guy) but after 2 weeks of fighting and lots of tears they finally gave in to me dating outside of my race. Now the real problem is that since he doesn’t have a college degree and comes from a broken up family (different family upbringing) my mom is telling me to break it off with him. She wants me to date someone with an education and from the same family upbringing–bring a boyfriend home with the same education level (I recently graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in science). I’ve told them that their standards are not the same as my criteria…tho he doesn’t have a college degree he’s still in the process of graduating and he has a full-time job, fully supporting himself. [/INST]  What a difficult, difficult situation. You want to follow your heart in a direction your parents can’t support. I’m sure they mean the best for you. I’m sure they love you. They may even be right about the problems you and your boyfriend will face, coming from such different cultures and families. But it’s not as simple as deciding who is right.You are all caught in a generational difference that is extremely painful all around. By the older generation’s values, you would follow your parents’ wishes. But young people these days are generally left to discover for themselves whether a match is made in heaven – or not. Sadly, trying to bridge the two has got you lying. It does keep your parents at bay but you are betraying their trust and your own values. I’m sure you’re not at all happy about either.You may not have realized it, but fighting and tears demonstrates to your parents that you aren’t ready to make such an important decision as who you will date. If you are clear about what you want to do, you should be able to present your views without all the drama. You would then tell your folks that their approval means the world to you but that you respectfully disagree and will make your own choices. My guess is that they don’t want to lose you any more than you want to lose them so you would probably be able to work it out.The fact that you haven’t been able to do that suggests to me that just maybe you have some doubts that you aren’t able to acknowledge even to yourself. The fighting may seem like you are standing up for yourself, but the lying and the giving in keeps you tied to your parents’ ideals. You’re trying to have it both ways: Do what you want but without risking parental disfavor. I think this is the larger problem: You have made your own choices but you aren’t convinced. The current situation with your boyfriend is the issue that brings your own uncertainly forward. In that sense, it’s not about him. It’s about coming to terms with your own beliefs.This kind of dilemma isn’t unusual for someone who is 24. The twenties is when most of us come into our own. Like the butterfly struggling to free itself from the cocoon, the struggle to define ourselves, separate from our family of origin is what makes us become a mature adult.I’m not going to tell you what to do about the boyfriend. I do think you should start by clarifying your own thoughts instead of trying to change your parents’ opinions. The rest will flow from that.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  I used to never get angry at anyone until about 5 months ago. I will be talking to someone or just watching TV and I will start getting annoyed for no reason. That in turn will lead to anger but I don’t know why. When it’s happening I can’t reason with myself enough to wonder why it’s happening. It’s not until I am alone later that I realize what had happened. I need to find a way to fix this because it is starting to hurt my family and friends. I have always loved to hang out with friends but lately when I text my friends I get mad and just stop texting them. Later I will wonder why I didn’t do it I get mad at myself. I want to do things with them but my anger mood swings always gets in the way. My family means the world to me and I love them to death but I have been getting in a lot of fights with them recently. I just got in a fight with my sister yesterday over nothing. She had just asked me a question about myself and I blew up at her for no reason. It wasn’t like she was asking me anything bad I just got angry. I don’t want to be mad anymore but I don’t know what to do to fix this. I just want to be back to my normal happy self. I used to get the nickname if smiley from all of basketball coaches because I was always in such a good mood. I want to get that nickname back. Please help me. [/INST]  Thank you for writing. Your letter shows you to be an insightful and caring person. Instead of blaming others for your situation, you are looking for ways to get back in charge of your feelings so you don’t hurt the ones you love. Good for you.You didn’t mention if anything happened 5 months ago that could have started this. Is something bothering you more than you want to admit? If that’s the case, a few sessions with a counselor might help you get to the bottom of it and to figure out what to do to make things right again.But if this change of mood has come on you all of a sudden with no discernable reason, the first step is a trip to your medical doctor. Your irritability and touchiness just might have a medical reason. Hypothyroidism, for example, may lead to depressed mood. Insufficient sleep is also a major cause of depression in teens.If you are medically fine, then it’s time to see a mental health professional. What you are reporting may be the onset of a depression. Many people think that depression only shows up as sadness and being down. But in some people, irritability is the primary symptom.The good news is that you can be treated. Medical causes can be addressed. Psychotherapy can help you learn how to manage your moods and get back in control of your life.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in England: I lied to my boyfriend for over 1 1/2 years about my sexual relation with my ex. When he kept asking I would say I did nothing. I confessed recently that I did do things but only confessed 10% of it. He offered me the chance to tell him anything else but I didn’t and I promised him that I won’t lie again. [/INST] There are at least a couple of layers to this question. Details about your sexual history are no one’s business but yours. You have a history. I’m presuming that he has a history too. It is only necessary to share with each other that you each have a history. If either one of you had a negative experience that will effect your relationship with each other, that does need some talking through. If you contracted a transmittable disease, you are responsible for telling your partner that you are taking the right precautions and/or getting treated for it. And, of course, you do need to talk about protection from an unwanted pregnancy. But beyond that, past encounters are generally private information.Then there is the issue of your lies: Sometimes the unconscious has a way to raise red flags even when a person doesn’t consciously see them. I think you know you aren’t really ready to be talking about marriage. You are only 18. You need more years to mature and to figure out who you are before settling down with anyone., especially at your age. Before making the decision to marry, you need far more contact and time with a boyfriend  than a long distance relationship can allow.I think your unconscious helped you out by letting you violate a primary value held by your guy. On some level you knew lying would be a deal breaker. But instead of breaking up with him, you have made it possible for him to break up with you. Maybe it seemed easier to deal with guilt than to deal with rejecting someone you really do like. Whatever the case, I doubt very much you can fix this. Even if it looks like you do, chances are you will do something else to set a break-up in motion.Trust your inner self. Apologize to the guy. Wish him well. And do the growing up you need to do to be the kind of partner I know you would like to be.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I think I have mental problems but not sure I’m not sure where to start. Since ever I was a kid I always felt that my mother favored my other two sisters and I believe that those feelings caused me to gain weight which caused me so many problems in my life. I always feeling insecure and I’m not confident. I felt like my mother was always making fun of me for being fat and so did everyone I knew. My father never played a big role in my life as a child he didn’t live with us but I knew that my parents had problems and they fought all the time. When I was 14 we moved to the United States and everything got worse for me. I continued to feel insecure and gained a lot of weight. My parents fought all the time. Throughout high school I was depressed. I found it hard to make friends. I still don’t have any friends. I saw a therapist a couple of times prescribed antidepressants but I didn’t take them. My relationship with my family was terrible they all hated me. I never liked anything that my mother said and I get extremely angry and yell and throw anything that falls between my hands. I have had thoughts of suicide but I never actually tried to kill myself. I blame my mother for my current mental state. Outside of my house I’m a very nice person, probably the nicest person you could ever meet but inside the house I can’t even recognize myself. During the summer I always go to my home country and I feel great but as soon as I come back here I’m depressed and everything is annoying. My father passed away last year and we had a fight right before he died and I feel guilty that I didn’t get a chance to say sorry. I cope with my problems with eating. I feel alone, no friends and especially no family to turn to. Help me please. [/INST]  You have already shown a tremendous amount of insight and resilience in coping with your family. It sounds like it may be time, at 21, to begin working on your independence and individuation.It sounds like you need a plan to develop your identity away from your family. My encouragement is to connect with a therapist that can help you decide what direction you want to go in. (The find help tab at the top will guide you.) It may also be time to get reevaluated for medicine. The antidepressants may be helpful in breaking the cycle of anger and helplessness, and the therapy may be a way to gain some support in bringing the changes you want into your life.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I grew up in a chaotic household with a bizarre, usually absent father and a raging, abusive and hate-filled mother. Both drank, but sober she was even worse. We had to deny anything was wrong and no one helped me or my siblings. I bore most of the abuse. [/INST]  You’re probably right that your paralysis has something to do with your history. As a child, you were helpless to get out of the situation. You learned then that the way to prevent further hurt was to essentially freeze. It was a survival technique that worked at least some of the time. You never learned how to be effectively assertive because it was pointless to even try with your parents.Lessons learned in childhood are very powerful. In our early years, we put down a template for how people operate and what we need to do to get along. We then carry that template into every other relationship. I suspect that you generally avoid being around such difficult people. That works as long as you can get away. But, as you are finding, when you are stuck in the situation, your old survival pattern comes back. The problem is that it doesn’t work in your adult life.This is exactly the kind of pattern that therapy can resolve. Therapy will help you separate past from present and learn new ways to take care of yourself. Your therapist will help you practice handling these situations during sessions and will give you support while you try them out in your life. You will probably also need to do some work healing the hurt child you carry within so that angry people don’t immediately send you running (figuratively) for cover.You’ve carried the hurt long enough. Please follow through. Ask your doctor or someone you trust for the names of therapists in your area who have a good reputation. I always suggest that people give themselves permission to interview a few therapists before settling on who to work with. The most important variable for whether therapy will be effective is how comfortable you feel with the therapist.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have childhood onset bipolar disorder and have been in therapy, on and off, for many years. I have been seeing my psychiatrist for three years now and approximately one year ago, I started seeing him weekly for therapy sessions as well as med management. Over the past several months, I have been having really strong feelings for him. I know this is common in therapist/client relationships, but I think of him constantly in erotic ways. [/INST]  Thanks for reaching out for advice on how to deal with this painful dilemma. I can feel how much you respect your psychiatrist and how meaningful it has been to you to have a safe place to share your deepest thoughts, feelings, and experiences.  As you said, it is not uncommon to have sexual feelings toward your psychotherapist, especially if this is the first time you’ve felt emotionally safe and nurtured by a male.While it would be a huge risk to share these intense feelings with your psychiatrist, I encourage you to do so. It sounds like he has proven to be very skilled, professional, and helpful to you in your therapy so far, so hold on to your positive experiences with him in order to muster up the courage to bring up your feelings in an upcoming session. Start slowly and start with sharing generalities, just like you’ve shared in your email to me. You can share your feelings without sharing all of the details of your fantasies.  The ability to work through your erotic feelings for your psychiatrist with him, and to experience his continued support and acceptance may allow you to reach a new level of healing.Take good care of yourself!Julie Hanks, LCSW </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have recently had increased anxiety and panic attacks due to being sexually abused. This has triggered me to have disordered eating in order to try to control my situation. I have been experiencing some anorexia and bulimia tendencies. I am now considered underweight by Bmi standards (17.5). I also believe I am experiencing depression. I want the depression and panic attacks to stop without the use of medication, and have considered therapy, but I do not want to give up the eating disorder. It brings me peace and a sense of control, and the weight loss has improved my self confidence.  I am not sure what to do next. Do you think a therapist will help me through the anxiety and depression without making me address the eating issues?  I am not experiencing any ill health effects and just want to lose 7 more pounds. Thank you! [/INST]  A: I think therapy is a great idea, and I’m glad you are thinking of giving it a try. I personally take a holistic approach to viewing problems and see individuals as a whole. In that light, the anxiety, depression and eating disorder are all most likely related to each other and might also be related to the sexual abuse you experienced. If you get help for the trauma, you will also be getting help for all the other symptoms you’ve described.Most of the clients I have worked with who have an eating disorder are not eager to give it up either.It gives them a sense of control, but unfortunately it is based on false information. Body image distortion is very common, so what you perceive as looking good and boosting self-esteem, often looks concerning to others. Eating disorders can be quite dangerous and can negatively impact your body’s ability to regulate its own health. I know it might be scary and quite challenging, to enter therapy with the idea that you might have to give up something you don’t want to lose, almost like giving up a friend. But if that friend is actually hurting you rather than helping you, it’s at least worth taking a look at. There are many ways to develop a sense of self control in your life as well as improving self esteem. By working with a therapist, you can dramatically improve your repertoire of coping skills. Rather than focusing your energy on what you might have to give up, try to focus on what you will gain if you can rid yourself of the unwanted symptoms. I would suggest looking for a therapist who specializes in trauma and abuse and address all your problems as a whole.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve been diagnosed with purely O OCD last month but I don’t know if my thoughts are obsessions or already delusions. I don’t know if I’m losing my grip on reality but just a good few hours ago, a random thought popped into my head: “What if everyone were cats or aliens and I’m just imagining them as people?” It never stops to bother me now and even though I know it’s completely ridiculous, I just can’t help but worry that I might start to believe it and see people that way. It’s like my belief systems are being challenged cause I don’t have a set religion as of yet. (i.e.: my OCD’s caused by some entity) and I don’t know what to do. I’ve always had faith in science and now it’s hit me that there’s probably some supernatural forces at work in my mind even though that sounds a bit absurd. I’ve found solace and comfort in the company of people when I have OCD panic attacks so maybe my brain did this for me to become more miserable. I just don’t know what to believe anymore. I’ve been on two meds and they helped me feel like myself again for two weeks but then it’s back to this situation as soon as I dabbled with the idea of something paranormal working against me. I just fear losing control and becoming clinically insane and non-functioning. :/ Do you think I’m slowly slipping into schizophrenia or insanity? Are these just obsessive thoughts or already delusions? I worry that I might convince myself into believing/doing these things and that horrifies me. Everytime I talk to someone now, a thought pops up in my head and says ‘Why am I talking to this alien?’ I know it’s too ridiculous but I don’t know what to do anymore. Please help ASAP! Note: I’m currently on Lexapro and Rivotril. [/INST]  Individuals with a specific type of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) commonly believe that they are developing a mental illness, often schizophrenia, because it’s considered to be the most severe and they fear it the most. They might become obsessed with the fact that they are going “insane” or developing psychosis. It is quite common. The thoughts that “pop into your head” are likely obsessions, a symptom of OCD. My sense of the situation is that your symptoms are most likely associated with OCD and not the development of psychosis but only an in-depth, psychiatric interview, with a mental health professional, could provide a diagnosis.The fact that you have been diagnosed with OCD, and are being treated for OCD (rather than schizophrenia) increases the likelihood that your symptoms are not indicative of psychosis.It is a concern that you are taking two psychiatric medications, yet continue to experience significant symptoms. It may mean that your medication needs adjusting. Report your symptoms to your prescribing physician who can then adjust your medications accordingly.If you are not currently in psychotherapy, you should consider it. OCD is a complex disorder which often requires both medication and psychotherapy. One without the other is generally not recommended. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My mother has lived with me for years since she is regularly unemployed. Whenever I moved during the last 16 years, she usually followed. In the last 4 years, she has become paranoid–someone is stealing electricity, wifi, cable, cell phone service, water. We didn’t even have wifi or cable at the time. I even checked the water and electric usage, but found they were consistent with usage at other addresses. Then she decided someone must be at home at all times because someone is sneaking into the apartment–to mistreat our pets, to fiddle with the electricity, to steal services, to live in the attic. She also claims someone had wired the apartment to listen to us, wired the front door so it would randomly open, stole our forks (I don’t know where they went), stole the Mummy dvd (we have at least 100 dvds, but that one was the only one taken, sneaks through the ventilation, stops by and electrocutes her around 3 a.m. on random mornings, and added wires under the driver side of my car (don’t worry she pulled out). Someone disrupts the signal on her analog radio, she insists all power, circuit breakers be off, and the major appliances unplugged except for the refrigerator and a few lamps. She says her last 5 cell phones were hacked and taken over by someone. I have never experienced or witnessed any of the problems she claims. So she accuses me of helping the someone because I say none of these issues can be proven. She won’t see a doctor, and she can pass any mental test. Honestly, I wander if she is a dick rather than sick. These incidents have been continual at 3 dif ferent addresses. In the one address, the landlord said she could not live there any more because she was entering the basement and changing the handyman’s repairs. (I don’t know if this accusation is true; she denies it.) At one point nearly 2 years ago, I expressly asked her not to destroy the landlord’s county letter because it itemized repairs to the house. She ignored my request and ripped up the documents. I gave her $4000 (my savings) and my car and kicked her out of my apartment two years ago, so she stayed with my aunt for a week, in hotels for about a month. Then she came back for another $2000 (payday loans). Eventually, she spoke with the VA hospital, received a bed at a homeless shelter, and money to return to school. They also offered to pay for housing, but she couldn’t find a place she was comfortable with for the money offered. After a few months in the shelter, she “couldn’t” make it to the shelter by curfew, so she was kicked out and moved in with me again. Within a year, we moved again. About 8 months ago, we were evicted from a house (only 5 months into a year lease) because “someone” had cut out all the copper connecter in the electrical outlets (a fire hazard), had cut a large outdoor cord connecting the central air to the house, and had removed insulation and created holes in the outer walls. I cannot prove it was my mom, but no one else was in the house. She or I am always home. Now we’re in an apartment and she opens the outlets and has cut the connectors to the phone jacks. She still experiences are all of the aforementioned issues. I discovered she had pulled wires beneath the driver’s seat of my 8 month old car. She claims someone is hacking into its system. I plan to move because of unrelated issues, but because of my mom, I am hesitating. I am sick of the problems. I am sick of her refusing to listen to reason. I told her 5 months ago that I wanted to go separate ways with this move. I tried to give her time to find an apartment, get a job, request government assistance (she hasn’t worked since 2010), but she has proven she unwilling to take care of herself. She wants me to buy her a Winnebago, so she can live in the woods with her dog and cat. I am tempted because I don’t want to continue this cycle anymore. I don’t want her to live with me. I don’t even want her to know where I live. I don’t even feel guilty about it any more because every time I find something she “fixed” I just cry. However, I feel bad for the dog and cat since I’ve had them for years. I feel guilty because there are no other siblings or family… just me. This situation feels like the rest of my life. What do I do? [/INST]  Your mother’s pathology sounds like it is getting worse and is not likely to get better without outside intervention. I would plan a date for you to move out an on your own and then begin working toward gathering services for your mom. Managing your mom isn’t something you are going to be able to handle by yourself. Think of her in the same way you might think of her having extensive medical needs due to an illness or injury. She needs care beyond what you can offer — and will need specialists to help.The first step is to get an evaluation by a psychiatrist. If your mom won’t do this, an evaluation by her physician would be the next best thing. If neither of these is possible, I would return to the VA and speak to them about your mother’s needs. Getting them onboard will be helpful as your mother is likely to need continuous ongoing help.However, moving out doesn’t mean not extending yourself to help with your mother’s needs. You’ll want to be able to help but also have a life of your own. Living with her under the current conditions obviously isn’t working for her, and isn’t likely to work for you in the future.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My son came home from Colorado and has been drinking and smoking pot for about a year. When he came home he was a little paranoid but ok. He went to see some friends and partied for 3 days, he said he only drank. When he came home he was hearing voices and uncontrollable we took him to a hosp. and they admitted him and gave him some medication. He went into outpatient therapy, but that was not helping with his problems he needed one on one. We went to a social worker and she said he wanted to hurt himself so she called cops and had him admitted. He was there for 10 days because he did not want to take meds. He’s in outpatient again and the doctor has him on 1mg at night and 10mg Abilify. I cut the abilify to 5mg because when he was on 10mg he heard more voices and holding his head all the time and not functioning. The doctor still thinks he should be on 5mg in morning and 5mg towards evening. We tried that and the next day he was so bad we thought we were going to bring him to the hosp. again. I called the office and they said the dr. Knows what he is doing and I should listen to them. When I did not give him the extra Abilify yesterday he seemed much calmer and wanted to do something. I am not sure what to do next I have been looking for other doctors but either they don’t take our insurance or they don’t have any openings for a few months. Is it possible someone age 30 can be ok and 3 days later be schizoaffective who never had any signs. And what medication is good. Thank you from a concerned parent. [/INST]  It is possible to experience psychosis after drug use, even if there were no previous symptoms. Drug use can trigger psychosis, at any age.People who have used illicit drugs, without negative consequences, are fortunate. Research shows that people who use illicit drugs have higher rates of psychosis than people who do not use illicit drugs. The simple truth is that drugs can be mind-altering and are dangerous. Had your son never used illicit substances, he may never have experienced psychosis.You didn’t mention the kind of drugs your son was taking. More recently, health officials are concerned with people taking synthetic marijuana, also known as “spice.” Emergency departments are reporting an increase in the number of patients coming in with “extreme psychotic behavior” after having ingested synthetic drugs. Despite their being banned in a number of states, it’s still easy to acquire these very dangerous drugs.Your observation about your son’s reaction to Abilify is important. The same medication may work well for one person and not well for another.The prescribing physician should consider your feedback. If he’s unwilling to listen, you are doing the right thing by trying to consult another doctor. It may take some time to find a doctor you like but keep searching. You want a doctor who considers your feedback and who is willing to make changes to the medication regimen, if necessary.Even though the doctors you have been trying to consult don’t have an opening, ask if they will contact you in the event of a cancellation. Cancellations are common.You might also benefit from consulting a licensed clinical social worker. He or she can assist you in finding a good doctor and help you manage your son’s condition. It’s always best to consult an expert when dealing with a possible serious mental illness.Abilify is a type of antipsychotic medication but there are many others. With the right medication, your son’s symptoms can be controlled and managed. Recovery is possible. Please take care. </s>"

My only guess is that he may be in some kind of approach/avoidance tension with love and sex.Your story reminds me of teenagers who want so much to be in love and to have sex but who are, at the same time, terrified of both. His behavior makes a kind of sense if his interest in you was his first attempt at a relationship or if he has had a number of failed relationships.The only way to know for sure is to ask him. If you can be curious and not take whatever he says as a personal rejection, you have little to lose by asking him what happened. But if your feelings are still raw, it may be better for you to remind yourself that his pursuit seemed too fast from the start and that this gentleman has too many problems to be a partner for you.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello all, I have been asking this question my all life. I have a lot of feelings toward pet like my puppy but nearly none towards humans. I tend to do things to manipulate to make them think of me as a good person who cares about them so they would come in handy when I need them. The thing is I am totally unaware of my doings when I do it but only after when I start to analyze my actions later. I realize that my actions become something natural, like it’s common sense for me to pretend that I care about someone. And when I come to sense later, I would feel odd about myself but no guilt or distress. [/INST]  When mental health professionals make clinical judgments, they gather a comprehensive psychosocial history about that person. Many of the traits that you have described could or could not be indicative of sociopathy or psychopathy, but a diagnostic determination requires extensive interviewing. Since I have so little information about you, it is difficult to answer your question.If you want a deeper understanding of your personality or to know whether you have a psychological disorder, then consult a mental health professional who conducts personality testing. If the personality traits you have described are negatively impacting your life, consider counseling. Thanks for your question. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My boyfriend has been institutionalized twice already over the past 2 years. He has had trouble finding a job, he had one but he was fired because he wasn’t able to concentrate and finish the work. I know there he had stopped taking meds again. The first time he disappeared but tried to break up with me 3 times prior that. After he left the hospital the first time he had problems with the meds for a few months, he didn’t want to take them. The second time he was committed again because he lied about taking meds and he started acting up again. After that time which was around christmas he continued taking the meds through supervision of his mom, she did though trust him to take it on his own and he lied again. Little things he did, laughing by himself, not eating leaving unfinished food everywhere and not being able to sleep, pacing around a lot. He started to Skype with other women and talking on Facebook. I felt offended and i called him out on it. After this he decided to travel out of the blu to new york to find a job. we went out one wed and he told me then and flew out to NY on thursday. He left with a one way ticket and it hurt me lots. I didn’t know if he was coming back. I know he didn’t take the medication while there because he told me. We have been going out for three years now going into four, we have never had relationship issues. I stood by him because i love him and i still would but this issue about cheating is becoming big and it has affected our relationship. His mom and i are close, we have talked about maybe him going back to the hospital so he can get help and maybe this time he can accept the fact that he has an issue. I don’t know what else to do, It is affecting me more than i though, i always worry about him. I have tried to help but i feel like it doesn’t matter. [/INST]  It’s important to try to separate the illness from the person. Some of the behaviors he is engaging in are likely due to his current instability. For instance, buying a one-way ticket may not be a sign that he doesn’t love you but rather a sign that his illness symptoms are not well controlled. Understandably, it’s difficult not to take his actions personally. Obviously, the cheating is a problem for the relationship but he’s unstable and not thinking clearly.Please don’t misunderstand. His instability is not an excuse for the fact that he may have cheated but his illness symptoms could be affecting all of his behaviors. His uncharacteristic behavior might simply be an artifact of his untreated symptoms.It’s going to be difficult for him to function in a relationship when he is unstable. It’s part of the challenge of being in a relationship with someone who has schizophrenia.Encourage him to take his medication and to be hospitalized, if necessary. You will likely see a significant improvement in his behavior when he is stable and receiving treatment.You may benefit from attending support groups at your local National Alliance on Mental Illness office. Many support group members are caring for loved ones who have mental illnesses. Some of the support group members may be facing similar issues. It would also be helpful to educate yourself about schizophrenia. The more you know about the disorder the more you will understand his behavior. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am not coping well with the grief of losing my son. He was charged of a double homocide in 2009 and is currently awaiting trial. I am mostly concerned with my inabiity to stop blaming myself. Logically,I know and tell myself that it is not my fault. However, there were signs that I should have paid attention to. Not to mention I ignored sound advice from experts to phone our local States Attorney and turn him in for probation violation. I found him unbearable to live with and knew something was seriously wrong. Why didn’t I see that if I couldn’t bare to be around him, mostly because of his torture to me and my family. Then it was only a matter of time that he was going to turn that terror onto others within the community. I should of known and I definitely should have listen to the experts. Now people are dead, because I failed them. Good and decent people. I want to be free again. I want to trust again. I want to live again [/INST]  I’m so, so sorry for the multiple reasons for heartache that you are carrying. You really have lost the son you thought you would have. You are not the first nor will you be the last parent who kept on hoping and hoping that things would get better, that your son would grow out of it, wise up, or learn his lesson. You tolerated so much because the love of a mother for a child is often like that. Somehow we feel that if we just hang in there and love them enough, kids gone wrong will come to their senses. Sometimes it even works. Sometimes the experts are even wrong. And sometimes they are not. Sadly, usually the only way we know is in hindsight. You can’t be faulted for being no better than the rest of us at predicting what would happen next.I don’t know if there was more you could have done. I do know that it’s common for parents to blame themselves. It doesn’t help that we live in a society that tends to blame parents. But as you are finding, blame doesn’t help. Even if you are somehow to blame (and I doubt that you are), accepting the blame is not going to change the situation for you or for your son. Instead, you need to find a way to sort out where you may have some responsibility and where your son made his own choices and then find ways to both forgive and to transform your experience into something positive. We can’t change the past but we can change how we use our past experiences to make things better for ourselves and others in the present and the future.To get good support and practical suggestions for doing that, you need more help than I can offer in an advice column. I just did an Internet search for “parents of prisoners” and found quite a few online support groups. I suggest you do the same and make use of the site that feels right for you. There is nothing quite so reassuring and supportive as talking with others who share a life experience in some way. In addition, you may want to explore some counseling for yourself and other family members to help you through this difficult time.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Before I got married I use to wear men’s bikini underwear (regular and string). For almost two years I have been secretly putting on and wearing woman’s panties. At first I was trying on and wearing my 18 year old step daughters panties in which she was ok with and than I decided to go out and buy some types of them for myself. eventually I was told to stop or a divorce was coming. I constantly thought about wearing them again to include men’s underwear i use to wear. I now continue to secretly wear my step daughter’s panties and buy some for myself. Is it wrong for me to wear/do and is there somewhere to go for help? I dont want my wife to know. [/INST]  The desire to wear women’s undergarments is not an unusual fetish. Generally, most therapists would not find it to be problematic unless someone was being harmed. The problem in this situation is twofold: you are unable to stop yourself from wearing your stepdaughter’s panties and your wife has threatened you with divorce.I am interested in what you said about your stepdaughter knowing that you are wearing her panties and her being okay with it. I am wondering how you know she is okay with it. Did she tell you that? Did she catch you in the act and not say anything to you? Perhaps, she is not okay with your behavior but she may not know what to do about it. From her perspective, please understand that she may find your behavior to be unacceptable but she doesn’t know how to handle the situation. It sends very mixed messages. She may not understand that you are wearing her panties because you feel a strong desire to wear women’s undergarments. Rather, she may believe that you are wearing her panties because they have some connection to her. That might be very traumatic and confusing to her. For that reason, wearing her panties might actually be psychologically damaging to her. If so, it has to stop. If you want to wear panties then you should purchase them and not wear your stepdaughter’s.I want to reiterate that the desire to wear panties is not necessarily a bad thing. As I mentioned above, it is not an uncommon fetish. The problem is that you are taking panties from your stepdaughter and she may be getting the wrong idea about your behavior. You can’t allow that to continue.The other issue is that you are hiding your behavior from your wife. It is never a good idea to lie to your spouse. Honesty is the foundation of every relationship and when it is broken it may be difficult to repair. She may be okay with the fact that you find it erotic to wear women’s panties but she may be upset and angry to learn that you are taking them from her daughter.I am assuming that you are hiding your behavior from your wife because you fear her reaction. My suggestion in this situation is that you either tell your wife or consider seeing a therapist who can guide you about how to deal with this situation. There is probably much that you feel that you have not written in this letter. It would be helpful if you had someone who could advise you about how to deal with the whole issue. Specifically, the aspect of sexual arousal from wearing women’s clothing and how to deal with this situation in your marriage.As I mentioned earlier I would also advise you to stop taking your stepdaughter’s panties. Your behavior is inappropriate and must stop.You may want to consider seeing a sex therapist. Therapists who do not receive specific training in sex therapy may be helpful but a sex therapist focuses on understanding fetishes and other related sex issues. Here’s a link to a website where you can search for a therapist in your community. Thanks for your question. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My regular therapist is advising me to get a social life, because not having one can apparently have negative health consequences. As I am health conscious, I have been attempting to follow his advice for several months now, with no success. I don’t like people. I always prefer to be alone and have no desire for a social life. I want to give up and just live alone so badly, but my therapist insists that I should find a social life. This onerous task gives me terrible anxiety. [/INST] The underlying reason motivating a behavior matters. Are you rejecting your therapist’s advice because of fear? Giving into fear is typically a bad idea. That is especially true with anxiety disorders. When you acquiesce to anxiety, it becomes more entrenched in your life.There’s a difference between having a social life and living in isolation. You mentioned not wanting to have a social life but didn’t define what you mean by that phrase. Without more context, this is a difficult question answer.Generally speaking, humans are social creatures. They like to be with other people. It’s considered normal and psychologically healthy to have social relationships. It’s problematic to lack social relationships.Loneliness has been linked to a number of health problems including poor cardiovascular and immune function, sleep problems and problematic stress reactions. Put simply, social isolation and loneliness are bad for your health. It’s so serious a problem that last year Britain appointed a Minster of Loneliness.There is a middle ground between having a “social life” and living in isolation. If you have people in your life whom you care about, and the quality of those relationships is good, even if they are few in number, and you are happy, then, perhaps no problem exists. I would encourage you to discuss this in more depth with your therapist. Good luck and please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: Our daughter is 6 and for Valentine’s cupid brought her a large brown stuffed bear she named Chubbie. She is very attached to the bear and is quite adament the bear is real. Is has long detailed conversations with the bear and becomes extremely emotional if you say he is not real or attempt to take the bear from her just to hold or play with. She always wants to play brother and sister with my husband and they pretend to go to school on the bus and play classroom. We tried for another child after she was born but due to a medical condition I could not have another child. She wants a brother and my question is, is the bear fulflling a void for her? Is this going to create anxiety for her in future? Could this empty place cause her to be detached emotionally? I love her with all my heart and would do anything for her. We play lots of games and spend quality time together. She is a super kid and we want her to be happy. Thanks! [/INST]  Please relax. This isn’t a problem. It’s her solution for not having the playmate she wants. It is unlikely to cause her anxiety in the future. If anything, it’s probably relieving it.It’s very common for children to develop this kind of attachment to a stuffed animal or to imaginary playmates, especially if they don’t have the friends or family they want. Kids who create the kind of play you describe are usually exceptionally smart and creative. Accept the bear. Get into it with her. Talk to Chubbie. Set a place at the table and make sure to ask your daughter questions about him now and then. Most kids are delighted when the grown ups decide to play.Meanwhile, your daughter is longing for a sibling. You may not be able to answer that wish, but you can certainly include more children in her life. Quality time with you doesn’t answer that need. Set up play dates. When she is a little older, arrange for sleepovers. Take one of her friends along when you go to the park or do something special. Once she discovers that she can have playmates, she’ll be less intense about wanting a brother or sister.At some point, you might explain to her that some families are big and some are small; that you are meant to have one special child and that you are so glad it is her.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been with my boyfriend for two years. During these two years he has became someone I love and trust and could see myself with forever. That word though “forever” scares me to death. I know he is perfect for me and he adores me. Our families click and he loves my daughter with all his heart. We are like the picture perfect little family. [/INST]  What you should do is listen to yourself. You’re right. You don’t yet know what you want in your life. Having a number of relationships in the teens and early 20s is normal. This isn’t necessarily a “cycle.” It’s how people sort out what they do and don’t want in a life partner. My guess is that having a child made it difficult for you to do the kind of self-exploration that is usual at this stage of life. Responsibilities to your daughter do come first. But that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t take the time to understand yourself and to decide who it is you are looking for.I suggest you slow down. At 21, you have plenty of time. You shouldn’t settle into married life unless you are 100 percent ready — no matter how sweet the guy or how invested your family is in him. Your family isn’t going to live with him. You are.When you are disinhibited by alcohol, you say what you really think. Since you are under the influence, it’s likely that your boyfriend doesn’t take you seriously.It’s time you had that same talk while cold sober. Tell him that he may be perfect in every way but you’re simply not ready to settle down. Free him to explore other relationships. Get yourself involved with school or activities that will help you develop yourself and expand your circle of friends. If this relationship has promise, you may come back around to it in a few years.Even though you aren’t ready to be a wife, you are already a mother. Make sure to give your daughter the love and care she deserves too. You need to nurture her development as well as your own.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi, I am having a lot of issues with my mom. We have always had a rocky relationship, if we are ever nice to each other it is fake. She makes the fighting seem like it is all my fault, and that I do not respect her. She thinks I am just a “teenager” and does not listen to a word i say. She is the most overprotective person I have ever met in my life and I just cant do it anymore. She clearly does not trust me when I have never done anything for her not to, and she knows that. i have never been caught doing anything, nor do I do anything remotely bad in any sense. She thinks I am basically the devil, and has never ever been real with me. She has these fantasies about who I am, and I honestly think she has something wrong with her. She has this obsession with taking my phone 24/7 no matter what. Every night at 8:00 she takes my phone, and never misses that time by a minute. Lately, she even tried to say I get my phone for an hour after school, and then it gets taken until the next day. I am a teenager??? I honestly think she has a mental disorder because every night, she will just go crazy. I cannot describe it but its like she becomes a different person. take this Friday for instance, she calls me while I am out with my friends to call my friends mom and make sure that she is still bringing me home. Its like when she gets bored she just tries to instagate me. Most people would say this is just her making sure I am safe, but once I gave her the moms number– she thought i was giving her the wrong number and threatened to call the grocery store where the mom worked, just to tell the mom that my friend was rude in the car? Please help! How do i make her understand I’m just a teenager? (From the USA) [/INST]   I appreciate you writing in about this as I believe the struggle for independence is a common source of friction — particularly between mothers and daughters. Just like you have trouble understanding your mom’s behavior, she has trouble understanding yours. When things are going okay would be the time to ask her to sit down and talk. It sounds like there is a bit of a pattern where something happens — a fight, and then a lull, then another fight. I think that needs to change.When things are okay — and no fights or conflicts are present — ask your mom to talk. Plan out what you would like to say ahead of time, and see if she is open to it. Three things seem important. The first is to find times when the relationship has been good and recall those times with your mom. Find a few memories to remind both of you that not everything is a fight. Secondly, you want to know what the two of you could do to improve the relationship. That you notice how much you fight and ask if there can be an opportunity for change. Finally, let your mom know that you would even be willing to go to a counselor (if you are) to work with her on making things better.You want her to respect you more, and I think the way to do this is through a conversation you have when you are not fighting. If you need some help with this you may want to talk to your high school counselor as he or she might be able to give you some pointers about approaching your mom.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: Since young I had constant mood swings and extreme emotions. I said things that weren’t logical or had any sense at all. Most of the times I’ll get so mad I’ll hit someone or say horrible things to them. Had problems with self harm and people thinking that something was wrong inside my head. [/INST]  Although you’ve provided me with a description of your distressing feelings and behavior, you didn’t ask a question. All I can do is respond with what I think you need to know — which is this:Just because therapy didn’t help at one time doesn’t mean that it isn’t helpful. You just didn’t find the right helper for you. Clearly you are troubled. Clearly you have difficulty making friends and relationships, dealing with your volatile emotions and idiosyncratic behaviors. You may be correct that this all started with the bullying in school, but you haven’t been able to end it. If you could have talked yourself out of the problems, you would have done so long ago.Please. Listen to the people who love you. They are right to be concerned. They are doing their best to give you solid advice. But they can’t make you help yourself and they don’t have the skills to help you learn to control your moods or behavior.Make an appointment with a therapist. If you don’t like what is happening in the first few sessions, talk about it. Maybe you and the therapist can adjust how your sessions are going. Maybe you need to look again for someone who is a better “fit” for you.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, before I start this question I’d like to start by saying I do not have a problem with alcohol. I have contacted you before and your feed back was very helpful. As you know I have been suffering from depression for two years but two weeks ago I went for a walk and I had time for a really long hard think and a thought came in my head which i thought i would never think and that thought was why should i feel down and depressed as i have felt like this for too long. I decided i would try to think positive as life is to short to feel unhappy so i tried to blank the negative thoughts out of my head and for the rest of that week i felt something i have not felt in a long time and that was happy and positive and my head felt so clear but as anyone knows who suffers or sufferd from depression it is easy er said than done to think like this that is why this thought was so powerfull and eye opening i dont know where it came from. [/INST]  You have learned some very important things about yourself. You know that alcohol affects you badly and puts you back into depression. You know that you have the capacity to stop the depressing thoughts and to instead think positively. You also know how good it feels to be more in control of your mood. Good for you!I can tell you this: If you’ve turned your thoughts around like that once, you can do it again. It won’t always work 100 percent but chances are it will work at least a good amount of the times you try. What you stumbled on yourself is a well-researched and well-documented technique called “acting as if.” When a person learns to act as if he isn’t depressed and keeps it up for a day or two, often enough the depression lifts some. Believe it or not, the brain chemistry even starts to change. Keep it up and you gain more control.My best suggestion to you then is first to eliminate alcohol. You already know it messes you up. Then, have faith in yourself. You already proved that you can shift your thinking and feel better. No one did that for you. You did it. You can do it again and again until it’s a habit. Meanwhile, find something to do that makes you feel good about yourself. That can be anything from running to working out to volunteering somewhere to making art or music. Put those good feelings into doing something positive so you’ll have more to feel good about.I’m glad we were helpful to you before. I certainly wish you well in this project. Let me know what happens. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi, I`m 17, I have started finding a unhealthy way to deal with stress, depression, and loss of my dog too well. I didn`t know how much stress my beloved dog helped me with for soo long till he died this year. When I went to school this one day I got told that I was stupid and pathetic because I didn`t take a phone away in one of the classes I was teaching. I know I don`t have the right to do that but I wasn`t feeling good, I had just lost the dog and the teacher had to take it out on someone about the fight he got into the day before and he took it out on me. That night I went home and used a saftey pin on my wrist. My mom doesn`t get it I have been regected by my real dad and my step and this is my final year and I have to find money to go to college and she doesn`t know that I don`t sleep my eating is down I do eat somedays but I can go a few days to a week without eating but I can always make it look like I`m eating just so that she doesn`t get on my back. I think that every thing is my fault since I`ve been told since I was little that everything is my fault my grandpa`s death that was my fault, and the dogs death also my fault. My mom is sick so my step dad blames me for that and it puts sooo much stress on my I get really sick to my stomach and don`t eat or sleep. I thought things would get better they just stayed the same I get thoughts about killing my self and tried but never went threw with it I chickened out because I can`t do what my one friend did to her friends and her parents and little sister. I feel like I`m alone I`ve tried to make my parents happy but they just seem to not really care about me. I feel like I`m a no body to them cause my step dad told his friend in front of me shes not my daughter and I feel like I just don`t belong in this world. I need help!!! I don`t want to feel like this anymore!!! [/INST]  Not every kid gets the family she deserves. Sadly, you are one of many, many people who were born to a family that doesn’t give her the emotional, psychologicial, and practical support she needs. The fact that you have grown to be the sensitive, articulate person you are in spite of it tells me that you have more inner strength and gifts than maybe you can even appreciate right now. Your sadness and distress are too much in the front. You’ve been told so often that things beyond your control are your fault that you’ve started to believe it. You are not at fault for people being sick and dying. It sounds to me that people who can’t cope with their own grief and responsibilities are shifting blame and shame to you.In the States, there is a public service advertising campaign going on called “It gets better.” Celebrities and politicians are speaking out about how they were bullied for various reasons and how it got better once they got older. The message to people like you is, “Hold on. There’s hope. You’ll grow up and grow away from your current situation. It gets better.” It does. College isn’t high school. The adult world isn’t either. Once out of your family, you can make the kind of family you want.So hold on! Depriving yourself of food won’t help you. You need your strength. Not sleeping won’t help you. You need your rest. Hurting yourself won’t help you get to a better place either. Instead, turn that self-destructive energy into motivation to get out of there. Go see your guidance counselor. Look for scholarships and grants that will get you to school in a year. Get a part-time job if you can and start saving your money. If your resume is weak, get yourself into some extra-curricular activities that will make you attractive to schools. Grades not good enough? Look for a “gap year” experience away from home. There are exciting, and subsidized, service opportunities out there. You’ll get a year away from your hometown and some money to help pay for school. Colleges look favorably on someone who has done a gap year as well.I’m glad you’ve ruled out suicide as an answer. Saying “yes” to life is the first step. Now gather your resolve to take charge of your life to make it better. You can do it. You’ve managed to survive this long. Now it’s time to do better than surviving. With some effort on your part, you can be in an entirely different place next year. You can make a new start and a new life. You’re almost there. You can make it better.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  Hello, my boyfriend is great to me in person. We function well as a couple. However, he does certain things. He often yells out uncontrollably “I’m not gay, i’m german. I’m a God in the flesh.” He also mentions he’s a genius and the government is spying on him. To remedy this he screams in the shower “Shut up!” He also has a tendency to yell at his computer. This has disrupted my sleep. He’s also claimed he saw the devil leaning on his shoulder whispering the secret of life into his ear while brushing his teeth. He’s a hard worker. He works 2 part time jobs and owns a small business online selling his art. While I support him, he is obsessed, like he will spend hours and it will get to the point of me telling him to come spend time with me. It’s like he’d rather sit on his computer then have human interaction. That isn’t my biggest concern. He claims to have “out of body” experiences led by a voice. He refuses to give me the name of said “Voice.” Also, he has a few dozen dream journals intricately written out. A relevant question. When you just wake up, how can you perfectly and legibly write down your dream? Now here’s the last thing that bothers and hurts me. Since I agreed to marry this man, I did a background check. His records clean, he’s not abusive, but he had 3 dating sites stating he was single. I called him out, I printed his profile. I had the proof in front of him and he said I was crazy over and over. I take 2 trains and walk 1.5 miles to see him (this is until my vehicle is repaired.) I have bought him groceries for nearly a couple months, shown him loyalty and love. He brought up us getting married, which was to early but now at a year I feel it’s fine to get engaged. He’s a bit older than me, i’m 29 and he’s 39. Iv’e been told that he may have these profiles up related to self esteem or validation issues. He has a tendency to self deprecate himself and often asks me if I love him. I wished you could meet him and you would understand. I’m paranoid you think i’m sounding like a unhappy girlfriend. Why would someone show you such strong devotion in person, yet act insane and persue others online? [/INST]  Obviously, his maintaining dating profiles on the Internet is problematic, but you seem to be overlooking potentially major red flags about his mental health. His symptoms may indicate psychosis. Psychosis is a break with reality and it is associated with several serious mental health disorders including schizophrenia.It will be difficult for him to function in a relationship if he is psychotic. Untreated psychosis tends to become worse over time. Some people require hospitalization. Until his symptoms are under control and he is consistently participating in treatment for at least one year, you should postpone your marriage plans. Once it is clear that his mental health is stable and he is willingly participating in treatment, then you might want to revisit your marriage plans. Until then, I would advise against it.Marriage is a major life decision with implications for the rest of your life. You should consider counseling to discuss these issues in more depth. Given your minimization of his mental health symptoms, my concern is that you have not given much thought to how his possible mental health condition could affect your life as a couple.Have you considered the following questions regarding his mental health: What if his symptoms worsen? How will you handle erratic behavior? What if he doesn’t participate in treatment? What if he doesn’t think he’s ill despite his symptoms and refuses treatment? What if the “voice” tells him that you’re secretly trying to harm him and that he should preemptively attack you to defend himself? Those are only several questions to consider. Assuredly, there are many more.If your fiancé does have a serious mental illness, it will greatly affect your life and relationship. You need to be fully informed about his illness and how it could impact your life together and the lives of your children, should you decide to start a family. Most importantly, there needs to be a clear plan for how his illness will be managed. Many people with serious mental illnesses have successful relationships but without treatment, that might not have been possible. Premarital counseling would be a very wise decision. Books and online support groups are also good sources of information. Please take care. </s>"

I had temper tantrums, wet the bed until I was nearly ten years old, sucked my thumb, and had other adjustment issues, etc etc [/INST] I am so very sorry for the loss of your brother and your friend. What is happening to you is a perfectly normal response to the fact that difficult events have piled up to the point that they overwhelm your ability to cope. From a very young age, feeling in control and counting on yourself are ways you have kept yourself feeling safe. I imagine that the two deaths you’ve experienced – losing your brother by Multiple Sclerosis and your close friend by suicide – have challenged that sense of control and therefore safety. On top of that, you have an infection. This will also lower a person’s ability to manage stress.A healthy way to get back in control is to take the steps necessary to help yourself. You need to deal with both your medical and mental health. See a doctor and get that sinus infection cleared up. If you can also give yourself a way to grieve and to honor the losses of the last couple of years, you may be able to pull yourself out of this on your own. Since you’ve isolated yourself from family, I hope you have a few friends to turn to. Friends shore us up from the outside when we haven’t got enough strength to do it from the inside. If you don’t have a support system, please consider seeing a counselor to help you with the grieving process.Psychology Today’s website suggests, “If you’ve got too much change (or just too much, period) going on in your life, here are some tips to get yourself and your life back, ASAP:”“1) Get the best sleep you can 2) Meditate or pray in the morning 3) Make yourself eat, no matter how crazy things are 4) Load up on greens the easy way 5) Get through one day at a time 6) Make no your default answer 7) Take sanity breaks 8) Give yourself a Sabbath day every week”Your go-to self hasn’t totally abandoned you. That part of you is still functioning enough to write and ask for help. Now please reach deep inside and work with that core of strength to get yourself the help you need to get your life back on track.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a 12 year old girl in Lithuania: I can’t tell if my mom is abusing me or if I’m just overreacting. My mom is a normal mom but whenever she gets mad she cusses, hits or ignores me. She calls me bitch, a piece of sh-t, an idiot, and more. However, when she’s on Instagram or in front of other people, she acts as if she never calls me names or stuff. [/INST]  You are not over-reacting. Your mom knows she is doing something wrong or she wouldn’t act differently when she is in public. Your dad knows something is wrong or he wouldn’t be taking your side when he witnesses these episodes. No kid deserves to be hit and called names by the parent who is supposed to love and protect them.I can’t know if your mother is ill, over-stressed herself, has inadequate parenting skills or some combination. I do know that this has to stop. Your dad at least believes you but seems powerless to stop it. Your bestie is right. You (and your dad) need help.Ask your dad if he will take the initiative to get you all into family therapy. If he can’t or won’t, do talk to a teacher or counselor you trust at school. School personnel often know of ways for kids like you to get some help.In the meantime, stay out of your mom’s way. Get involved in activities that keep you busy after school. Do assignments in the library. Resist the temptation to argue with your mom. It will probably only make things worse. Instead, tell her you are sorry she feels that way and leave as gracefully as you can.I hope your dad steps up and helps. If you think it would help, show him your letter and this response.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Okay. This all started from when I was eight years old. My mom and step dad both worked a lot so they would have my cousin Amber babysit me. One day she kept me inside the house and pulled all of the blinds shut. She proceeded to force me to perform oral sexual favors on her. She was 16 at the time I believe. So, after forcing me to do this she took me to the bedroom and forced me to have sex with her. After she was done she made me clean everything up saying if I got caught she would kill me. A little time passed from there and she took me outside to go play with the neighbor kids. We all ended up taking a walk back through the woods until we came across the interstate. Amber and the older kids started playing chicken with the cars and then they thought it would be a good idea to force me into playing. They put what looked like a screen material over my head and shoved me out in front of a big rig. Luckily I fell short of the truck. I am now 22 and over the past few months I have several nightmares a week reliving the event. Also, when I was 10 I watched my great great grandmother pass away in front of me. Now I see her from time to time out of the corner of my eye. Could this be PTSD? Also I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I feel the need to self harm a lot but can refrain from it most of the time. I’ve been clean two weeks now but the urges keep getting stronger. I did just get back on my insurance policy and am currently considering a therapist again and getting back on my celexa. I was initially out on it after a suicide attempt 3 years ago. Please help me figure out what direction I should head in. [/INST]  Be proud of the fact that you have been able to withstand the urge to self-harm but as you noted, the urges are growing stronger. Don’t ignore those feelings. They are a clear sign that you should seek professional help. It would be a very wise decision.It’s possible that the experience of seeing your dead grandmother is a sign of PTSD. It might be a flashback but without more information, I can’t know that with certainty. Reliving the truck incident is likely a flashback and related to PTSD.You can learn more about flashbacks and PTSD once you begin counseling. You can also educate yourself about PTSD. You can read more about it at Psych Central’s website as well as other websites including the National Institute of Mental Health, among others.You are a victim of abuse. It can directly affect your self-confidence and self-esteem. Your babysitter was a predator. Had anyone learned about what she did to you, she would have likely been arrested. At the very least, she may have been mandated to undergo counseling.You are considering therapy and my recommendation is that you do so. Fortunately, you have health insurance, which affords you the opportunity to seek treatment. You are on the right track. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care. </s>"

This feeling first arise when I am in 12th th actually when I think that I have to speak this word after 2 minutes then after 2 minutes that word not comes out from my mouth for example one time I am going to my home (Begusarai) and I was standing in a long queue on ticket counter but when my number has came then I can’t speak Begusarai when ticket issuer ask about my destination I try to speak Begusarai but I only spoke bbbbbb ….. Begusarai has not came out from my mouth with respect to time this problem become more severe now when I start presenting in my class I start very well but in middle this feeling comes in my mind that I have the habit to stuck so when this feeling comes in my mind I start stucking in almost each word and sometimes forced to left my presentation in middle. I try hard to forgot this feeling but it must come during presentation I am very tense. Please help me. (From India) [/INST]  Thanks for your letter. There are several ways to improve your public speaking skills. First, use the resources at your college to help with this problem. Most universities have a public speaking course, and if not a whole course they are very likely to have a seminar that should help.There is also a group specifically for public speaking, which many business people use. There is a Toastmaster Club in India that can direct you to events near you.I would also take an acting class. Public speaking is performing. The people who teach acting a very used to giving exercises to help their students present. This way the problem doesn’t have to be all about the anxiety, it can also be about meeting new people and having fun.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] About a week ago, I stumbled upon the fact that I am one day going to not exist on earth anymore. Ever since that realization, I cannot stop thinking about it and it’s ruining my life. I no longer find anything enjoyable and every time the thought comes up again, I get a strange feeling in my gut, similar to the feeling of a broken heart and I begin to have a sort of breakdown. I just want to stop thinking about it in total and go back to my normal life without this happening multiple times a day, almost every hour. Please, is there any way to fix or cope with this? I’m getting to the point where it is too hard to handle. [/INST]  Remember, all religions believe that you survive death. There may be a few odd religions that do not but to the best of my ability I know of none. Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews, etc., they all believe that you survive death. That in itself should be comforting.Two of the best scientists in the world, whose talks can be found on YouTube, state flatly that you will survive death. Dr. Robert Lanza and Dr. Federico Faggin are there names. Both of these men are recognized worldwide as great scientists.Reading books about quantum physics and the research that is being done in that field, will show truly amazing things. Things that indicate a reality of such intricate complexity that it’s reality may always escape human understanding.Many books have been written about near-death experiences. Many videos exist on YouTube, created by people who have had these near-death experiences. They describe going to a place that is so amazingly wonderful that they resist returning to this world, when they are told that they must do so.Do the things that I have suggested, reading, watching, etc. Talk to religious people around you. If you still have any concerns at all, then by all means, see a therapist. Good luck. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I’ve been married for 16 years since high school and have two kids. Due to my families situation my mom and sisters lived with us for a year or two here and there. In the past, I had no problem with my husband staying up late and watching movies with my sister or even go out together to movies and stuff. I was pregnant with my second child and at times I would be tired and go to bed early or didn’t feel like going out. They always kept each other a great company, they both drink, laugh together, listen to one another’s stories and my sister always seeks his help in many things. [/INST]  Your husband is trying to have it both ways: A loyal wife and an admiring attractive not-quite girlfriend. He doesn’t seem to value your relationship enough to care that he is putting more and more emotional distance between you. In fact, it seems he is trying to make your children feel sorry for him.It looks to me like you have been trading in your happiness and your relationship with your sister in order to keep this “good husband and dad.” Only you can decide if that’s a trade you are willing to continue. Do be aware that talking to his parents and yours will likely tip the delicate balance the two of you have been maintaining for some time.I suggest that rather than take advice from me, you see a local therapist. There is a great deal to think about when dealing with this kind of situation. You owe it to yourself and your kids to talk to someone who can hear the whole story and who can be an ongoing support for you.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi. I’m married for an year and had a love marriage. We were in relation for 9 years. And I had to wait 4 years for the approval from my husband’s family for our marriage because we are in different religion and I had to convert to their religion for this marriage . My husband is working abroad and I am staying with in laws. In the first time my in laws were very nice to me. But they hesitated to spend money for my needs—where they give to my sister in law. And my in laws where jobless and my husband was giving them money for daily needs he spent around 60000 -80000 rupees and I had a job with very low salary. And my husband didn’t give money for my needs because I had job. Now I am pregnant I used to spend my own money for my needs even hospital needs. Never my in laws gave me anything. When I told this to my husband he asked thme about this had some issues. From that we decided that we will start a new life and save some money. I was thinking it was going perfect till now. Yesterday I just asked him that whether he is giving money to his parents or not. Then replied yes . And he give 50000 rupees every months to his parents for their expenses. Where I was struggling to find money. Please tell me how can I can get him to help me? (From India) [/INST] Your husband is not prioritizing your needs and expects you to manage without this provision. I suggest you choose several tasks that you normally do and stop doing them. Your husband is not likely to respond to your requests if he hasn’t already. But, when you are not doing what he expects because he is not doing what you expect, it will get his attention.This is likely to cause some friction between you and your family and your husband. I’d encourage you to explain that you will not be able to keep your part of the bargain if he isn’t able to keep his. But do not make it an idle threat. If he doesn’t give you the money, you need stop holding up your end of the expectations, but be prepared for a conflict.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am going to see a psychiatrist on the 22nd of Jan: Well I am just wondering what you think, I have been denying I have had any mental illness for some time, but my girlfriend of eight years and her mother have stated my symptoms are progressively getting worse, I decided to open up usually like when I get in trouble with the law I don’t say a word about any instabilities I have not wanting or warranting any persecution, but I normally do not like leaving my home all though my job required me to do so I am blessed to have my own business which I am surrounded by dogs, everyone I meet someone I know they think I’m a freak, I already know they can care less about what I say I hate venturing outside I have this sensation I’m always being watched I even go in the back and I hear both of them laughing possibly at my instabilities, I can go on but I don’t want to make anyone mad I think that’s about 300 words I just want to know if I have any symptoms in particular or if its a waste of time and money to go thank you. [/INST]  No, it’s not a waste of time or money. If you are a home dweller because you work from home and have little reason to leave your home then, I would not see this as a problem. However, it seems as though the reason you won’t leave your home is because you are overly concerned about what people think of you. You also feel as though you’re being watched and that people are laughing at you. In the latter instance, the reasons you won’t leave your home may be indicative of paranoia, which is a significant mental health concern.Paranoia is not a normal, everyday occurrence. It is associated with mental health disorders such as paranoid personality disorder. The main features of paranoid personality disorder include a pervasive pattern of distrust, suspiciousness of others and feelings of persecution. It is possible that you have paranoid personality disorder but only an in-person, in-depth mental health evaluation would provide that determination.As I described above, the reason you won’t leave your home is what matters most. In your case, it seems as though it is paranoia that is keeping you confined to your home and thus may indicate the presence of a mental health disorder. It would be prudent to make an appointment with a mental health professional, report your symptoms and participate in the recommended treatment. Please take care. </s>"

Now please follow your own good instincts and get the help you need and deserve. Start with a complete medical check up to make sure there isn’t an undiagnosed medical issue that is part of the problem. Do be honest about how often you are smoking weed.Then ask your doctor for a referral to a licensed therapist. The first thing that will happen is a thorough evaluation. Then you and the therapist will talk about the therapist’s recommendations.Medication may or may not be recommended, but it is at least something to talk about. (A course of prescribed medication will probably do more for you than marijuana.) But even more important will be getting to the root of your feelings and providing you support to take the necessary steps to change your life.Please follow through. You are only in your 30s. You can have decades of good life ahead of you if you take care of yourself by getting the help you need.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, please help! I am a 48 year old male, married with kids. I have always had some degree of anxiety (a worrier), usually very minor but with all the stressors I’ve endured lately (double job loss, part time business failure), I believe it has accelerated to an OCD condition – I have a fear of hazardous material, and in particular asbestos and the diseases it causes. My fear is heightened when I think my family may be exposed as well. I’ve had this fear (to a much lesser extent) for quite some time since learning the horrors of contracting mesothelioma, but it has seemed to peak – I can take the thoughts to the extreme as described below. [/INST]  Though I cannot provide a diagnosis over the Internet, your symptoms seem indicative of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is an anxiety disorder that is characterized by unwanted, reoccurring thoughts and repetitive behaviors.Among OCD sufferers, specifically among those with health-related anxieties such as yours, often no amount of reassurance is enough. In fact, the act of seeking reassurance can make OCD worse. It temporarily decreases anxiety but it reinforces the “seeking reassurance” behavior.OCD sufferers should resist the urge to seek reassurance and instead endure their anxiety. If an individual habitually seeks reassurance when they feel anxious, then not doing so will increase their anxiety, possibly to very intense levels.Those levels cannot be sustained. Anxiety always decreases. In that way, anxiety can be likened to the law of gravity: what goes up must come down. Individuals with OCD are unwilling to endure their anxiety. They do everything in their power to escape it. That is a mistake. Anxiety avoided in the short run is only intensified in the long run.As you stated, “I know the odds of an illness are very remote, and exposure and illness are essentially out of my control.” It is generally believed that individuals with OCD, through their rituals, are attempting to establish control over events and situations that in reality they cannot control.You can reduce or eliminate your anxiety by focusing on reality. If you force yourself to believe in reality, then your anxiety will diminish.Beginning therapy was a very wise choice. I would strongly urge you to continue. Therapy can help you to understand and to be comfortable with things that are beyond your control. This wisdom has been shared by mankind since the beginning of recorded history and perhaps before. It is exemplified in the Serenity Prayer, (adopted by Alcoholics Anonymous) “God, grant us the Serenity to accept things we cannot change, Courage to change the things we can, and the Wisdom to know the difference…”OCD tends to be a progressive disorder but this is not true for everyone. Symptoms may occur on certain occasions or on all, decrease over time or increase. There are effective treatments for OCD including cognitive-behavioral therapy and relaxation training. A specific form of cognitive-behavioral therapy, known as exposure and prevention response, has been shown to be a very effective treatment. Medication can help as well.I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.   </s>"
"<s>[INST] Well, this is looking hopeless..but here goes nothing. I am 22 years old and I have been depressed my entire life. All I ever do is play video games so that I can escape my life and occupy my time. Sometimes I will get so depressed that I can’t even do that, I’ll just sit alone and stare at nothing until I have to go to work so that I can survive another day for a reason unknown to me. I never knew what I wanted to do with my life, I still don’t, and I am not interested in anything. Nothing excites me, I feel totally dead inside. Writing this now seems so futile. [/INST]  You know what I’m going to say: Get yourself to a therapist!!! You are seriously depressed. You may be grieving as well. (Yes, grieving; grieving the relationship you never had and now can never get from your folks.) Sitting alone in your room isn’t going to change how you feel. Hating your life isn’t going to change it. Writing to me isn’t going to change it. Going to social events and events without doing something about the underlying depression probably won’t work.You somehow found the energy to write to us here at PsychCentral.

"<s>[INST] From Malta: I’ve never reached out to anyone for help regarding this matter, however my wonderful girlfriend knows what my problem is, but only because I’ve been inflicting her pain. [/INST]  You do have control — at least some of the time. You are at least not being physically abusive with your girlfriend. But, as you well know, that is only the first step. You learned lots of negative ways to express anger from your father. Unfortunately, you didn’t have another strong male in your life who could teach you the positive ways to handle it.Yes, there are positive ways to be angry. There is nothing wrong with anger as a feeling. Often our anger tells us that something needs to be fixed. But there is plenty wrong about yelling, swearing, belittling and being generally disrespectful. Those behaviors only teach other people to distance from you. Problems never get solved.I suggest you get into either an anger management program or therapy to help you learn constructive ways to deal with anger. In addition, observe how people you respect handle their irritation, annoyance and anger. Copying good behavior is always a place to start. There are also excellent books on the subject.And there is a forum here at PsychCentral where community members share and support each other in dealing with strong emotions. Go to the “Find Help” tab, then click on “Forums” to find the group.All I can do is make those suggestions. If you really want to solve the problem, it is up to you to take the next step. I hope you do. The stakes are high. If you continue on the path you are on, it is likely you will end up like your father and you will hate yourself for it.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I began nursing school in 1983 and got near completing it – to the final year. Although my grades had always been superior emotionally I was a wreck and had to drop out. However, I DID discover at this time I had hyperthyroidism, and believed that had much to do with my stress over the last part of nursing ed. I had to stop, have treatments of various sorts for that condition, and it has since been under good control. [/INST]  Thank you both for writing. To help keep this answer straight, I’m going to call the nursing student “NS” and the pastor’s wife “PW.” The problem might have something to do with early abuse but in NS’s case there is a huge mitigating factor. NS was well loved by her bio-mom who so much wanted the best for her that she encouraged the relationship with the pastor’s family. She has also been loved and supported by PW who gave her what her own mom couldn’t. One possibility is that there just may be some loyalty issues at play here for NS since PW is a nurse. Does becoming a nurse feel to NS like some final betrayal of her mother?If NS were seeing me, I’d ask her to imagine that we had some magic and all the obstacles had been cleared away and that she has become a nurse. How would things then change? What would she expect of herself? How would her relationships with important people in her life change? What does she imagine others now expect of her? Often imagining a positive outcome will highlight the fears. Then we would address those fears directly.I do think PW is correct: NS needs a counselor to help her identify what is blocking an otherwise smart and motivated woman. At 47, I imagine that NS is really sick of this and wants to get on with a career she has been working toward for so many years. I can’t suggest a counselor but NS’s primary care physician would be able to help her know who to call. Someone in the PC community who comes from the same area might also have suggestions. I do have a bias that a therapist who is close in age to NS would have a more intuitive understanding of what it means to be getting older and to be feeling that it may be “now or never” to go for her goals.I wish you well,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I don’t know what to do anymore, I avoid my thoughts and feelings by focusing on anything to keep my focus off of how I really feel. I know my actions are unhealthy, I know it is affecting my life negatively, but I am afraid. I can’t get anything done, I can’t focus on important things, because that makes me think about myself, which leads to me feeling worthless and hateful of myself. I have problems remembering things, and I think it is linked to my repression. I need help, but I don’t want my family knowing just how broken I really am, I don’t open up easily, I am not even sure if anyone notices how much pain I am in everyday. I want to scream it at them, but I fear how they would judge me. I also tend to put others before myself, and that is part of the problem here, they have their own issues, the last thing I want is them to focus resources on me, when I feel they would be better spent on almost anything else. [/INST]  Writing in with your question took courage, and I’m glad that you followed through. It sounds like you are in a lot of emotional pain and are perhaps suffering from clinical depression. It is a real illness and nothing to be ashamed of. You don’t have to keep it a secret, but you do need to take further steps to get treatment.On one hand, you don’t want to bother your family, but on the other, you are hoping that they notice how miserable you are. It is too dangerous to play this game and you are the only one suffering. You need to take matters into your own hands and see your doctor and/or look into what mental health services are in your area. If you can’t bring yourself to do this on your own, at least confide in one friend or family member and allow them to help you seek out appropriate services. I’m sure your family loves you and wouldn’t want you to be suffering like this if they knew how you really feel. Depression is treatable and you don’t have to continue feeling the way you do. There is a light at the end of the tunnel and once you start addressing the clinical symptoms, you will start feeling better about yourself.In the meantime, exercise has been shown to be an effective (and natural) treatment, and there are many good self-help books stemming from the cognitive behavioral therapy world that you could be utilizing on your own. Pushing things down and avoiding them isn’t working. It is time to try a different strategy.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] Every couple of months or weeks…I seem to come up with a new scenario as to how I am dying. I always have this general feeling of malaise. I can’t remember the last time I was ever genuinely happy. I am always down. I have no desire to do anything. Well, recently my self-diagnosis is that something is wrong with my heart. It feels like I am constantly on the verge of a complete panic attack. I feel way overly aware of the organ inside my chest. I feel sick, I just feel it beating the wrong way all the time. I panic to the point where it palpitates and majorly picks up speed…and when it does that, I think about how that is also a sign of something being wrong with my heart. And I can’t decipher what is happening out of panic, or what could be me dying. My chest gets so tight and I’m always thinking about it. It’s always hard to breathe because I am trying so hard to stay calm. But heart problems can cause those exact symptoms as well. I get chest pains, over my entire chest. It feels like they happen mostly when I am breathing very hard. Every time I think about it anymore the worse the panic gets. I keep looking up all these symptoms trying to convince myself it’s all in my head but it’s so hard to tell when anxiety generates the same symptoms. I just had my first literal anxiety attack about it and this is where I need to draw the line. I had to lie on the floor and just breathe. My ears were ringing, my heart was beating so hard I could hear it over the ringing in my ears. I couldn’t really see, everything was echoing…and I was certain I was dying. Then suddenly I snapped back, I got up…took an anxiety pill and got on here to write. It was a lot easier to deal when I was convinced I had any other disease…but this one is so hard to set aside. There is ALWAYS the possibility that something is SERIOUSLY wrong too. And I am far too terrified to go see a doctor to find out if I am right. I’m just going insane. I don’t want to leave this earth just yet. But every day feels like my last because of this panic. I want out of my mind. What am I supposed to do? [/INST]  What you are supposed to do first is see a doctor. Just because something is in your head doesn’t mean that there might not be a real problem. It’s always important to check on the medical facts first. If there is a medical root to your problem, the first step toward a cure is to get a diagnosis – which will lead to a discussion about treatment. But without a diagnosis, you are only making yourself crazy thinking about all the possibilities.If you are medically clear, then we’re looking at a psychiatric issue. You are probably correct that this is anxiety-based. Where you are not correct is in thinking that an anxiety pill is going to fix what ails you. The medicine will help settle you down, it’s true. But you also need to learn how to calm yourself and interrupt those racing thoughts that lead to a full-blown panic attack. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy has been found to be very effective with people like yourself. Take a look at “Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy” by David Burns. The book is very readable and easy to understand. You may find that you are able to use the tools described in it on your own. If not, please consider finding a therapist to coach you. There is no reason to go through life going “out of your mind.”I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: My mom is a schizophrenic and will not accept treatment. She has had absolutely no relationship with me in the last 3 years since her breakdown. Before that she did the basics of raising me, food, clothing, school, etc but was verbally and emotionally abusive and occasionally physically abusive. She had a VERY rough childhood and she actually raised me much better than what she had, so I won’t be too hard on her, but it did affect me. [/INST]  It’s not at all unusual for people who did not have a healthy relationship with their mother to find other people to fit the role. In fact, the dimensions of many female friendships have a “mothering” dimension to them. As long as there is reciprocity, it can be healthy.Since you mention BPD as one of your issues, I do have concerns about you calling this woman “mom”. It may set up expectations that she can’t possibly meet. It may encourage a level of dependency on your part that doesn’t belong in a healthy friendship.I suggest you work with your therapist on grieving the fact that your biological mother hasn’t been able to be the mother you needed. Then create a circle of friends who are mutually supportive. Do talk to your therapist about this exchange with me. A therapist who knows you can give you better advice.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Sorry to waste your time with a problem that is completely my fault, but I have been free of self-injury for over 1000 days now, but it is still a fight sometimes. All the information on the internet seems to say find someone to talk to, but that is a lot easier said than done for me. My best friend is 9 years older than me, and is married with a baby and a full-time job, and doesn’t necessarily think of me as a friend, so she isn’t really available to help me very often. I don’t really have many other friends. I do have a counselor at school but she made it clear before break that she will email when she is ready to start back up and until then does not want contact with students so at least at the moment she is not an option at all. Also, she doesn’t seem to see my SI as an issue because whenever I bring it up she pretty much ignores it then goes back to whatever she must have planned to say. (Maybe because I never did anything that left permanent physical damage) [/INST]  An unequivocal statement of fact is that cutting, and self-injury, is never a wise idea. It is always a mistake. Self-injury is a sign that someone is suffering and that they lack the necessary skills to deal with emotional pain. Specific reasons why you should resist the urge to cut are provided below.You have not cut yourself in a very long time and it is important that you resist the urge to do so. One thousand days free of cutting is a major success. Try to remain committed to your ongoing success.I would recommend that you find additional support systems that you can count on when the others are unavailable. You stated that you have a counselor at school. Perhaps you should also have an outpatient therapist. I would also recommend attending a support group. Your local community mental health center, outpatient therapy center or your school counselor could assist you in locating a support group.You also might want to consider journaling. The content of the journal could include the following: What has kept you from cutting for the past 1,000 days? What other types of behavior have replaced the cutting? How has your life changed since you stopped cutting? What positive gains have you made over the past 1,000 days? How would you instruct others to have their own “1,000 days free of cutting?” Answering those questions might assist you in resisting the urge to cut and it may serve as a reminder for why you stopped. I hope that you can remain free from self-injurious behavior. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] So my younger brother who is in his twenties just pulled out two knives on my mom in the kitchen because they got into a verbal fight. My mom is very over protective and cares about her kids very much and can sometimes be overbearing. My mom got into a verbal argument with him because she didn’t like who he was hanging out with and his current job. My brother goes from job to job and can never maintain one stable job. He is constantly asking my parents for money and they always give it to him because they feel bad for him. He asked my mom for gas money and he ended up using it for something else that she doesn’t approve of. Long story short, he went on his normal psycho outbursts that he always does but this time he pulled out the knife which he never has done before. I’m also concerned because whenever my brother is really pissed off he’ll say things like I’m going to go shoot some people I’m going to kill people he says this during his crazy psychotic outbursts, but then 10-15 minutes later when he’s calmed down he apologizes and says he doesn’t mean it. I have several videos I’ve recorded of him saying this, without him knowing. I recorded this because I NEVER ever want him to legally purchase a gun. If I ever found out he wanted to buy one, I want to use these videos to the police so they can put on his record that he cannot buy one. I know my brother very well, and a lot of times he can be really nice but when he says he is going to kill people it really frightens me, especially with all the active shooting going on. I don’t know what to do because if I call the police he’ll get arrested and his future will be destroyed. [/INST]  Making a baby, pretty easy — raising a baby, not so easy. Effective parenting is not easily achieved. You probably have heard the term “enabler” used to describe someone who makes it possible for an alcoholic or drug addict to semi-function in the normal world. From your description, your parents are enablers for your brother. Your brother doesn’t need to deal with the realities of life because his mistakes and shortcomings will be rectified or mitigated by his parents. Pick the wrong career? Do the wrong things at work? No problem because the parents will give you a place to live and money when you need it.There appears to be great emotional tension in your home. The interaction between your mother and brother raised the tension level to a dangerous point, to the point where your brother threatens your mother with two knives. This occurred after a verbal exchange. Clearly, something was wrong with that exchange and something was wrong with your brother’s behavior. Your brother needs to learn to control his anger, and your mother needs to learn to speak to your brother differently.I would highly recommend family counseling. When your mother and father, help your brother to pay his bills or give him money for gas, they act as enablers. Enablers inhibit someone from growing. It is the enabler that allows the alcoholic to be an alcoholic. I am sure that no one in your family is deliberately attempting to cause problems and tension in the home, but they are doing so through poor interaction.Family counseling will analyze the interaction of the family members to determine what needs to be changed. The therapist will then teach you how to make the corrections. Failure to make the proper corrections could lead to disastrous outcomes for the family. I hope you will consider my suggestion. Thanks for writing. </s>"
"<s>[INST] This happens mostly when I’m in a situation where everyone is minding their own business on the bus, subway or just while walking on the street and I am suppose to do the same, but I just can’t. I feel that my actions are not natural and are being constantly controlled by my conscious mind. My brain feels overwhelmed from all the information that it is receiving and I just can’t act normal (even if I look normal, I don’t feel normal). [/INST]  There are several ways to approach this situation. The most efficient way would be to see a psychotherapist, specifically an expert in treating anxiety disorders. A few sessions may be all you need to eliminate this problem from your life.If counseling is not an option for you, then there are other possibilities. Psychiatric medication can help reduce the anxiety you feel when in public places. Perhaps your primary care physician or a psychiatrist could prescribe a medication to help you deal with this specific problem. Many people report that taking an antidepressant medication or anti-anxiety medication helps them in situations similar to yours. Some only need the medication temporarily. That may be the case with you.Forcing yourself to engage in the behaviors you are most frightened of is often the best method for overcoming fear. Confronting your fear may be the most challenging method but often the most effective.Hyper-intention may be at work in this situation. Hyper-intention essentially means that the intense focus on your fear makes it worse. It almost becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more “life” you give the fear the more it may intensify. The solution may be to do the opposite of what you would normally do in fearful situations. You could also shift your focus. Reading doesn’t seem to be working.A cognitive approach to this problem would be to analyze your thinking to determine if your thought process is logical. In this situation, you believe and are fully convinced that others are watching you. If we are exploring your belief from a purely logical perspective, a question comes to mind: What would prompt random people to watch you?In addition, part of the cognitive approach is looking for evidence to prove that your belief is correct. It is important to keep in mind that just because someone believes something to be true does not mean that it is. My presumption is that there is no evidence to support your belief that others are watching you. That would make it an unsubstantiated fear. If that is the case, then you must not allow yourself to believe in any idea that is neither logical nor supported by evidence.If this problem persists, you may want to consult a therapist. Check the find help tab at the top of this page for assistance. You may also benefit from reading self-help books including those written by David Burns. Many individuals have found that his books are particularly helpful. I hope this helps. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Is it possible to get rid of thoughts and silent my mind? Because some of my thoughts disturb me. I don’t want them but they are always there. Sometimes I even think I actually desire them or why else they would be always on my mind? I think they might be a little bit similar to intrusive thoughts but I’m not sure. There are the normal thoughts such as randomly thinking of jumping out of window or slashing my wrist while cutting vegetables. I’m used to them and I’m not worried because I know for 99% that I won’t do any of it. Only if it’s to prevent my family’s grief and hurt. [/INST]   You mentioned that you barely leave your home but didn’t explain why. Perhaps you work from home because of anxiety or some other reason. Knowing why you don’t leave your home is a key piece of information that would have helped me to understand what might be wrong.If it’s fear that’s keeping you in your home, then you might have anxiety or depression. Those disorders could also explain why you have these distressing thoughts.Your thoughts of harm may be a form of passive suicidal ideation. It could be something like this: “It doesn’t matter if something bad happens to me because I don’t deserve a good life and no one would care if I am gone.”It could also be that you see yourself as unworthy and believe that you deserve to be harmed, abused or killed. Those types of thoughts as described are commonly associated with depression.Idle time may be a contributor to this problem. Let’s assume that you do work from home and that is the reason for your rarely leaving your home. People who work from home often are isolated and feel lonely. You might have less time for introspection if you were working outside of your home and interacting with people. That type of distraction could help. It is not a cure but spending less time alone would force you to think about something other than your distressing thoughts.To answer your question directly, your thoughts are not “normal.” They are indicative of someone in psychological distress. Counseling is the ideal place to address these types of thoughts. Cognitive behavioral therapy works to change both thinking and behavior. I would highly recommend it. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in Belgium: So I don’t think my parents like me anymore. I’ve got a sister who has very good grades and is participating on a lot of swimming competitions, she wins always… They only have attention for her and I feel forgotten, my parents talk about her all the time. My whole life depends on when she has competitions or when she has to practice. [/INST] I’m very sorry you are in so much pain. It might be that your parents think that comparing you to your sister will motivate you. It’s a common parenting mistake but it rarely works. Sadly, it makes you always anxious about what your sister is doing instead of focused on what you need to do to grow and mature.You told me a great deal about what you don’t do. You didn’t share what you do do. You may not be interested in swimming, but I imagine you have other interests. Instead of accepting that you are second rate model of your sister, work on finding a hobby or interest or activity that is yours alone. (Then you will be “tired” too.)Don’t compete with your sister for grades but do work with your teachers to figure out what you need to do to improve. Academics aren’t for everyone. Not everyone is a top scholar. But everyone can do well enough in school to prepare for a job or more training or schooling. I have a guess that there is a subject or two that you find interesting.You are an individual who is valuable and lovable. Somehow the whole family has lost sight of that. Get out of you sister’s shadow so you can be seen.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a 13 year old boy in the U.S.: So I started talking to myself when I was about 6 or 7. I’ve always felt a little bit psychic. Which has nothing to do with this I think. But everytime, a week before a loved one of mine dies, without notice. I get a dream, which I wake up crying and the dream tells me I should start treating this person right, and outta nowhere. EXACTLY a week later the person dies. On from that, I have always talked to myself. [/INST]  I don’t know how to explain the psychic incidents. It may be that you have exquisite powers of observation, and that you notice things unconsciously that other people don’t notice. Or it may be a “gift”. As far as I know, no one has yet explained exactly why some people seem to intuit things that others don’t.Highly creative, imaginative people often talk to themselves. Ask anyone who writes or who is in theatre. There’s nothing wrong with it unless doing it when riding causes an accident! I suspect you might have the talent to be a novelist or screen writer. It’s something to at least explore.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a young woman in the U.S. I have been dating the same person for almost three years, I recently find myself getting angry because I feel i am not completing my goals as fast as I would like to and in return blaming it on the relationship, for the this reason: If i worked more overtime I could reach my goal faster but don’t want to because then I would miss him a lot and i would be miserable about seeing him less, where as when i was single i had no issues working as much as I had to, in order to obtain my goals because i had nothing to look forward to when I came home. [/INST] You are asking an important question. I don’t think it’s a matter of “getting past” it. I think you need to take the time to clearly think about your values and priorities. Women can and do have both an important career and a relationship. But you are right that it often takes a lot of juggling. Having clarity about what will give you joy over the long term will hello you make the choices now that will help you get there.I was so glad to see that your boyfriend is supportive of your goals. I wonder if you have been trying to solve your dilemma without sufficiently involving him. Perhaps the two of you can talk about how much time you need to spend with him to nurture and enjoy the relationship while you also work on your career. My guess is that he would also appreciate having some clarity as he pursues his own work goals as well.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S. : I seem to have a lot of problems connecting with people and building unbreakable bonds with people.  I try to because I want to feel that type of love and have those kind of bonds but it’s like the feeling is foreign to me.  I feel indifferent a lot of the time,  even when it’s something I should care about, I just don’t, even when I want to care. [/INST] I wish I had an easy answer for you. I don’t. I do know that what you are describing isn’t that unusual for teens. Learning how to understand and navigate relationships is the most difficult task of adolescence. Feeling alienated and “different” is also pretty common. A lot of your peers are also questioning whether they are “normal”. Many are confused and upset about love relationships. So, please, first of all, give yourself a break.The best indication that you are healthy is that you want to figure this out. Sadly, the only way you’ve found so far to feel connected is to provoke a negative reaction from others. Yes, it is a kind of connection, but I know that you already know how unsatisfying that is.I wish you felt safe enough with some other teens to talk about this. I think you’d find that you are more normal than you think. Sometimes youth groups provide that kind of safety. If that’s not an option, then a few sessions with a mental health counselor might be helpful. I suggest this, not because I think you have a mental disorder but because therapy can often provide a safe place for people to work through confusions and to get some support. Please consider it.I wish you well. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m reaching out because I don’t know how to deal with the reality that I can’t change. I tried to let go but I’m unsuccessful. A bit of my past: I came from a typical family. No violence, no sexual abuse. However, I grew up feeling that my younger brother was getting more attention because of bullying problems in school. Later, sexual abuse from my first “boyfriend” and a cousin (happened twice). I saw a therapist during 2 years in order to live with this and to heal these wounds. I don’t feel my physical self-esteem is a problem – I think I look good and I’m also a nice person. I like myself even with these wounds. It is a part of me that I accept. [/INST]   I admire your well thought out and articulate question and concerns. My best guess is that the objectification of women and your anger at it puts you in a double bind. If you feel good about who you are and are comfortable with your body — thinking you look good — may, in itself, be a type of objectification. It may open up the question of what looking good means — and to whom — for what reason. This concern would be amplified if you believe your boyfriend objectifies woman.Your therapy for the multiple sexual traumas sounds like it was effective in helping you cope and achieve self acceptance. As all of the attacks include betrayal, my guess is that the feeling of mistrust may be high. Your betrayers saw you as sex object and the fact your boyfriend seems to objectify women is, again, a double bind. His very attraction to you becomes cause for concern.I would highly recommend some sessions with your previous therapist as he or she knows your whole story and can help you sort through this last part.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in Australia: When I was a small child, I had a hard time controlling my anger, distress or any feelings of anxiety. My behaviour would sporadically change from isolating myself (hiding in a closet) to lashing out at others (verbally and I would physically intimidate, but never attack). But I also have a few memories of seeking out attention via coming up with poorly-constructed lies and faking injuries. [/INST]  That opposites are the same thing is an idea that goes back at least as far as the ancient Greeks. Hippolytus said that the road up and the road down are the same. This is called the unity of opposites.These days, we would say that behaviors that are apparently very different are only two sides of the same coin. In your case, you have gone from being overly empathic to being uncaring. You’ve gone from desperate attempts to help someone to playing (catfishing) with others’ feelings.Your own analysis may be correct. Your parents didn’t provide a role model for how to manage anger or distress. They also didn’t provide you with the comfort and caring that kids need to internalize how to provide it to others. As a result, you are bouncing back and forth between the extremes, with little understanding of how to have balance in relationships.I very much doubt that you can change this on your own. You’ve had years of “practice” with the extremes with nothing to moderate it. For that reason, I encourage you to find a therapist who specializes in work with adolescents. A therapist can hear your whole history and can help you reconsider the conclusions you reached as a child. With therapeutic encouragement and support, you can learn a more balanced and meaningful way to relate to others.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Every day I have thoughts of killing someone, it doesn’t matter who, I just want to see them die by my hand. I have been planning my first kill and it feels like I will not be able to hold back any longer. I have been a good person my whole life, well pretended to be at least. But I never feel for anyone, I say I have friends but I could watch them die and not shed a tear. My family could fall sick and I could put it out of my mind without a worry. I don’t connect to anyone, the only time I feel anything is when I am thinking of my first kill and seeing someone die in my arms again. I have seen that look before, I did not kill her but I didn’t stop her from killing herself. I find myself wanting to see that again, and again, and again. I am not sure I want to stop myself, but in case I decide that I do, how do I fix this? Or am I too far gone already? [/INST]  Sometimes people who have been through a traumatic experience repeatedly replay that experience (either in their mind or in life) in order to try to gain some mastery over their feelings of helplessness and pain. I may be reaching since I don’t have a lot of information, but it seems possible that the suicide of a friend was traumatizing for you. Why wouldn’t it be? Now you are separated from feelings of love, compassion, and connection and are replaying death scenes over and over. You’re stuck in this go-around until you find a way out. You seem to think that killing someone will do it. It won’t. It will only reinforce the problem. What will help is reconnecting with the good person you’ve always been.What makes this lack of feeling even more dangerous is that you are a military man. You probably have access to guns and you’ve probably had training in how to kill.Please — prevent yourself from doing something that will destroy someone else’s life as well as your own. Get help! Now! You’re not “too far gone.” Writing to us here is a statement that you haven’t given up on yourself. A place for you to start is the huge VA hospital near you. Military psychologists are particularly well versed in the various ways that people do and don’t manage traumatic experience.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am sending this message hoping that you will be able to help, or at the very least offer advice about my brother’s condition. My brother was socially awkward from youth, and eventually became depressed at an early age when he was put in the “special classes” back in elementary school. His depression grew with him throughout high school. At approximately 16, he stopped going to classes and isolated himself from the world. He would not be in contact with anyone, gave up his friends, and eventually stopped communicating with his own family. At one point about 2 years later, we found him lying in a bathtub speechless in a state of catatonia. We later found out that he had developed catatonic schizophrenia. We had no choice but to hospitalize him so that he could eat, sleep, shower, and do activities that he was unable to do in his catatonic state. He was given high doses of ativan coupled with resperidal and celexa. (during junior and high school, he was prescribed antidepressants, but they were ineffective.) Unfortunately, these medications began to wear off, so we swtiched medicatons, trying different types of atypical antipsycotics, such as seroquel, invega, and even saphris. NOTHING worked. Some even caused dangerous side effects, such as an involuntary head jerk. So we returned to resperidal and lexapro. Unfortunately, about a year ago, he began to develop a very serious and uncontrollable case of talking to himself. This goes on throughout the day, and when he speaks to himself, it is as if he is in a trance. He is unresponsive, and usually angry. He also yells obscenities, sometimes yelling inappropriate things in public. We recently switched medications to Latuda, assuming that the resperidal was responsible for his speech problem, but it made his problem worse, so we switched back to risperidal. We don’t know what to do at this point because we cannot see him in this state, but at the same time, we fear that removing him from medication will cause him to fall back into a catatonic state. It is a very sad case because he was normal growing up. Unfortunately, his problem is growing with him and we can’t even find treatments. If you know of any specialist in the New York area who would be willing and able to treat him, please let us know. We would greatly appreciate it. All the best. [/INST]  I am sorry but I do not have any specific physician referrals for your brother. My general recommendation is to have him evaluated by multiple psychiatrists and neurologists. I am suggesting that you consider neurologists because of the nature of your brother’s symptoms.Some of his symptoms may be characteristic of schizophrenia, including talking to himself, unresponsiveness and emotional instability. Others may not be characteristic of schizophrenia, including yelling obscenities and doing so in public. The latter symptoms may be more characteristic of Tourette syndrome. Tourette syndrome is a nervous system disorder that often begins in childhood between the ages of seven and 10 years old. It affects males at a higher rate than females. Characteristics of this syndrome include repetitive, involuntary movements and vocalizations, called tics. It is possible that your brother is experiencing tics and cannot control his behavior.Alternatively, it may be that his involuntary symptoms are related to schizophrenia or they are side effects of his psychiatric medication. Having so little information makes it difficult to discern the cause. That is why it is important that he’s evaluated by multiple types of specialists. I would recommend speaking to his current prescribing physician about a referral or several referrals to highly trained specialists.I would also recommend conducting Internet research regarding the best specialists in the New York area. You may want to start at the Columbia University Medical Center website which can be located here. Their psychiatry department offers a toll-free referral line. That may be a good place to start.Another good resource may be The National Alliance For Mental Illness in New York. They too offer a helpline and Internet resources that may be of assistance to you. Their website is located here.I am sorry that your brother and your family are experiencing such distress. It is difficult to watch a loved one suffer. It can be a helpless feeling. Your brother is fortunate to have a loving and caring family who are concerned about his well-being. I sincerely hope that you can find the proper help for your brother. Please take care. Best of luck to you and your family. </s>"

They are too young to take your husband on. They are much too young to leave. This situation needs to be fixed now or it’s only going to get worse for everyone.Please, get yourself and your husband to a marriage and family therapist. Find out why he needs to put two little children down in order to feel good about himself. Reassure him that you do love him but he can’t keep belittling the children you love if he wants your love for him to continue and grow.

"<s>[INST]  I have a client that I am trying to help get in touch with mental health services. He has previously been diagnosed with schizophrenia, PTSD, and borderline personality disorder. I was recently told that it isn’t possible to have both schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder. Is this true, and if so what is the reasoning? [/INST] I am not aware of any “rule” that says that individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia cannot be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.Psycom’s website states, “Schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder (BPD) can share symptoms. One study found that both patients with schizophrenia and patients with BPD experience hearing voices. The difference between the two being that paranoid delusions occurred in less than one-third of patients with BPD, compared with two-thirds in schizophrenia. The study also found that auditory hallucinations are common in both populations. According to the results of this study, schizophrenia and BPD frequently co-exist. Accurate diagnosis of either or both conditions plays an important role in establishing an effective treatment plan.As stated on Psycom’s website, “The term “borderline schizophrenia” does not refer to an established diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. It is sometimes used, however, to refer to an individual who meets some, but not all, of the criterion for schizophrenia or to refer to parallel symptoms of borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia. As noted previously, schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder (BPD) can share symptoms: one study found that both patients with schizophrenia and patients with BPD experience hearing voices. The difference between the two being that paranoid delusions occurred in less than one-third of patients with BPD, compared with two-thirds in schizophrenia. The study also found that auditory hallucinations are common in both populations. According to the results of this study, schizophrenia and BPD frequently co-exist, however, accurate diagnosis of either or both conditions plays an important role in establishing an effective treatment plan. While BPD is characterized by a pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships; schizophrenia is characterized by a range of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional dysfunctions.”Perhaps the person you learned this information from incorrectly believes that borderline personality disorder means that the individual is “bordering” between neurosis and psychosis. Under this theory, a person could not be schizophrenic because they have not crossed the psychosis threshold (i.e. their bordering between neurosis and psychosis), a required feature of a schizophrenia diagnosis. “Borderline” does not mean that an individual is teetering between neurosis and psychosis, although some believe this. People with borderline personality disorder display certain symptoms such as mood and self-image instability, difficulty engaging in relationships, anger and depression, “all or nothing thinking”, and so forth. A person with schizophrenia can display these aforementioned symptoms, in addition to psychosis, as well as some of the other symptoms of schizophrenia. The two disorders are not mutually exclusive meaning that if a person has schizophrenia, then he or she cannot be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. From my understanding, it is possible for an individual to have both disorders simultaneously. It may not be common, per se, but it’s still possible.Lastly, to further illustrate BPD and schizophrenia similarities and differences, study.com summarizes, “People with any personality disorder (such as BPD) tend to lose the normal flexibility of personality. They are relatively coherent, and can think for themselves. Their thoughts make sense, more or less, and they can interact at some level of normalcy. Their problem is that their minds are stuck in a sort of psychological rut. In the case of the BPD sufferers, that rut is right on the edge of complete instability. Their relationships tend to be intense and difficult, because their thoughts and emotional reactions make intimacy difficult, yet they cling desperately to the people who are willing to spend time with them. Schizophrenia is not a personality disorder, in the way we described BPD. People who suffer from its various forms are losing touch with reality, altogether. Instead of having personalities that cause difficulty by becoming rigid and inflexible, the schizophrenic personality begins to dissolve. The BPD individual may walk a strange ‘road’ of inconsistencies in his life, but the schizophrenic may walk no ‘road’ at all. His day is often spent in constant distractions, confusions, distortions, and contortions caused by the fragmented activities happening in the various areas of the brain.”I hope this information helps.

"<s>[INST] From a grandmother in Canada: My grandchildren ages 7 and 8 have been telling me for almost 2 years that they are afraid of mommy, my Grandson age 7 started soiling his pants, so I took him to the doctors and he said he’s afraid of mommy and she smacks them quite a bit in the head, I got the CPS involved and they sent the children to counselling. The counsellor seen the children one time and informed the children’s father the children are lying and are making stories up to get mommy and daddy back together. [/INST] I’m sure this is heart-breaking. It’s possible the counselor is correct. Children often do their best to try to get their parents back together regardless of the quality of their family. But what concerns me is that this has been going on for 2 years.I’m concerned that the counselor reached a conclusion after only one interview. You didn’t tell me if you have that information directly or if the children’s parents said so. If the latter, I do have to wonder if they are telling you the truth. Parents often don’t want others to know if they aren’t adequately caring for their children or worse.If there was only one interview, I do think a second opinion may be in order. I’m concerned about the length of time the kids have been telling you these stories and I’m concerned that the younger child is soiling his pants.I also think these children need some professional help, regardless of the findings. Whether they are being abused or lying, these kids need some help from an experienced, licensed child therapist. If they are being abused, they need to know that they are listened to and that adults will protect them. If they are lying, they need to be helped to accept their parents’ separation and to learn that lying is not an acceptable way to manage their distress.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I went to shadow people at their workplace, and I had a really good time. I really enjoyed who they were, and I enjoyed the whole experience of following them around and observing, but it was only for a week. [/INST]  It is always important to see reality clearly. In this situation, you were granted the opportunity to shadow people in the workplace. It was a pleasant and fulfilling experience, but it was short-lived. The ending of this experience should not have prompted such a strong emotional response.Your strong emotional response doesn’t match the reality of the situation. You only spent a week with these individuals. You barely knew them. They barely knew you. You and them were virtual strangers.You seem to be misjudging the situation. Maybe you believe that your connection with these individuals was deeper than it really was. It simply can’t be that strong of a bond since you only knew these individuals for one week. One week is hardly enough time to establish a deep bond with anyone.The proper response to this situation is to appreciate the time you had job shadowing. There should be nothing negative about this experience. It was all positive. You had a good time, you met new people and you learned a lot. Accept the situation for what it is (a great learning opportunity) and try not to turn it into something that it isn’t (a major life loss). It was a great learning experience. Nothing more, nothing less.If you continue to struggle with attachment challenges, counseling could help you immensely. Therapy allows for the in-depth examination of how you respond to life events. A therapist can determine if your emotional reactions are appropriate and teach you how to adapt your responses accordingly. Regulating your emotions is an important life skill.

"<s>[INST] I’m an 17 yr old Indian with ADHD and i want to pursue medicine and PG in forensic medicine.I cannot concentrate even for two minutes and i’m afraid that it’ll affect my career.I got my 12th results yesterday and found it disappointing as i expected better grades.My mom is extremely mad at me.I have an entrance exam two days later.She said to perform well in it (i’m not interested but my parents insisted).I actually have not prepared to a level to acquire a good score and i’m ashamed of it.Also a month later we’ve another one (really i’m interested in this) but my mom says don’t completely rely on a single option.The problem is that if don’t do well in the first one, my family and relatives will be really mad at me and i’m scared thinking about it.Also the one in which I’m interested has a tough competition so chances that i’ll get into it are extremely low.I’m feel guilty for betraying my parent’s faith in me.They are unaware that i’ve ADHD and i’m scared to tell them about it.I can’t concentrate on anything and within a few minutes i either start creating scenes in my mind or distracted easily.I want to stop it but I can’t.This habit has reduced my productivity.This is also a reason that i haven’t prepared for my exam.I don’t know how to handle this and i also don’t want to let down my parent’s hope.Help me please. [/INST] You should tell your parents about your ADHD symptoms. If you do, they can assist you in acquiring treatment. Without treatment, the problem may potentially worsen.It’s important to undergo an evaluation to determine if ADHD is present. Once a diagnosis has been made, a treatment plan will be developed specific to your needs. Therapy and medication often are often recommended for ADHD.It would be unwise to ignore this problem. It’s obviously causing you a great deal of distress. It doesn’t have to be that way. Getting help is the resolution. Good luck and please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve been friends with a girl online for almost 10 years. She’s always struggled with depression, and has dropped out of middle school, then high school, then university. She’s 24 now. She just got a really good job, but then she almost immediately started deteriorating. I’m Bipolar II, and I suspect she is also Bipolar. She cycles rapidly between manic states and depression. She has repeatedly told me she is constantly thinking about suicide. [/INST]  I admire your concern and love for your friend. However, this is a situation that you can’t manage alone. She needs help and her threats of hurting herself should be taken seriously. When someone threatens to hurt themselves and it is a serious threat all bets are off. Letting the police know her intention so they can deal with her directly is a caring, reasonable, and responsible way to respond.I would talk to her roommate about this as well. I understand this is a difficult response to make — but if you are trying to help this is a way to get people to her who can make decisions about what she needs. If you are going to make an error, make it on the side of taking action.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have bipolar disorder and go to a community mental health center where it is required to see both a therapist and a psychiatrist instead of just going to get your meds. I think that’s awesome and it has helped me tremendously. [/INST]  I’m sorry you’re having so much difficulty! It sounds like this wasn’t handled properly by the facility nor the therapist, but it is hard to know their policy and why it was handled the way it was.I’m sorry you’re feeling so bereft, and I would encourage you to ask the facility for recommendations for other therapists. They at least owe you that. I would also ask them for information about groups, as I do think individual therapy should at least be supplemented with group therapy — if not entirely replaced by it.The reason I suggest this is because groups meet very regularly, usually at the same day and time, even if a few people don’t show up the group usually runs because there are enough members there, and facilities tend to pay more attention to the fact that the therapists isn’t showing up for 6 to 10 people then if he isn’t showing up for one.I also think group helps you learn things about yourself from different perspectives, while giving you a chance to flourish in a stable on-going environment.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: I need help. I’m sexually attracted to my sister. I’m deeply in love with her & I can’t get rid of the feelings. I don’t know what to do. Is it really wrong to feel this way about her? [/INST]  Incest is absolutely wrong. But feelings are just feelings. If you are living with an attractive young female, it’s not unusual or terrible for a young man to have some sexual feelings about her — even if the woman is his sister. Nature does that. But most cultures have a taboo, law, or moral code that lets everyone know it is not okay to act on it. As long as you keep those feelings to yourself and don’t in any way try to act on them, you may be able to categorize those feelings as impulses that are disturbing but not abnormal.However you also say you are deeply in love with her. That does concern me. Love for a sister is not being “in love”. It makes me wonder whether you are having difficulty connecting with girls in general. If so, it may be that you are directing your longing for a relationship at a female who already knows you. In that sense, your feelings may be practice for when you do identify someone you would like to start seeing in a relationship.It may also be that you are scared to try to get close to someone so you distract yourself with these thoughts about your sister. If that’s the case, the best “cure” is to start taking some risks by hanging out with a group of friends that include young women as well as young men. The only way you will meet someone to love is by being social.If you find the sexual impulse difficult to control, please make an appointment with a counselor to talk it out. Acting on those impulses, even a little, would damage your relationships in your family for a very, very long time. Better to discuss it with someone who can help you explore what it’s about.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My best friend is suicidal and I want to know if there is anything I can do to help her. She has already told her parents but they really aren’t doing anything to stop her. I have told a teacher at our school and the counselor but all they do is recommend seeing a psychiatrist. I am really worried about her she almost always has cuts all over her body arms, legs, and stomach. Her mother has been in and out of prison even before she was born. Her mother is also in right now and has been since she was 7. In the past few years she has had a lot happen, she lost her grandmother on her dad’s side two days before Christmas in 2008. Right after that she moved from a big house to a small one and in the process lost connection with her former best friend. Many of her animals outside died and she sat with one of her cats and had to watch it die after it got attacked by a dog. This past year she had her aunt on her dad’s side die and lost a lot of her friends. She also found out that her mother was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by four different psychiatrists and borderline personality disorder by one or two. We were in seventh grade this year and for most of the second semester she was labeled a whore because of how she dresses and who hangs out with. This past summer is also when the cutting started it started off pretty bad but not frequent. It then went to minor burns and small scratches and then blew up again to bad cuts and they were very frequent. At the current moment she only has scars but is thinking about cutting herself again. I would just like an idea of what I could say to her to get her not to cut anymore. Thank you for taking the time to read this (and respond if you do). [/INST]  First of all, your friend is lucky to have such a mature and concerned friend like you. For 13 years old, you are wise to get some advice on how to handle this serious situation. You mentioned that your friend is suicidal. Has she told you that she has plans to end her life or are you suspecting that she is suicidal because of her cutting behavior? Often intentional self-harm, or parasuicidal behavior, is a cry for help without an intention to die. The two are related but don’t necessarily go together.Does your friend acknowledge that she needs help to address her cutting? If so, she may want to ask her parents to take her to their family doctor. Sometimes parents are more willing to take their child to get “medical” help than “mental” help. Also, have you talked to your parents or guardian about this situation and asked for their help and advice? It may be a good idea to sit down with your friend and both sets of parents and express your love and concern and see how you and your parents can support your friend.  Another possible resource is Childhelp national hotline. You can tell them about your concerns with your friend and they will identify resources in your area.If your friend’s parents are fully aware that their daughter is cutting and in need of psychological intervention and they refuse to get their daughter the treatment she needs, then this may be a case of medical neglect requiring or your parents to report the situation to child protective services. I hope it doesn’t come to that. Thank you again for writing in to Ask the Therapist.Take good care of yourself.Julie Hanks, LCSW </s>"
"<s>[INST] For as long as I can remember, I’ve always been a worrier. I’m now 15 years old (I’m a girl) and this anxiety is worsening. Anxiety and panic does run in my family but I don’t know if I have it. I’ve recently been looking into anxiety disorders and a lot of things would make sense. Symptoms I fall under are physical weakness, poor memory, fear or confusion, inability to relax, constant worry, shortness of breath, palpitations, upset stomach, and poor concentration. My earlier memory of panicking was about the age of five. My mom was leaving for work and as she drove I away, a stared out of the window wondering if she’d come back, or if she’d get hurt in an accident or something. I don’t know if that is normal at such a young age. Do you think I have an anxiety disorder? (Also, my father is an alcoholic and much of my childhood was of my parents yelling at each other and a few major incidences. My personality is very different than my siblings, which nobody really knows where it came from]). [/INST]  I’m sorry that you are struggling. It’s difficult to make a definitive diagnosis over the Internet but it seems that anxiety may be a problem for you.People who experience anxiety disorders often live in constant fear. Fear and anxiety decrease one’s quality of life. Anxiety is quite an unpleasant experience. People who are anxious are hypersensitive, tense, irritable, and often feel a general sense of unease. Anxiety takes a physical toll as well. Chronic worrying interferes with sleep, appetite and everyday life activities.The good news is that anxiety is a very treatable condition. The first step to accessing treatment, in your case, will be speaking to your parents. Tell them that you think you have anxiety. You can also show them your letter you wrote to us at Psych Central. The letter is important because it details your experiences with anxiety. Once your parents are made aware of your anxiety, hopefully they will assist you in seeking mental health treatment.Don’t think that counseling will only help you deal with the anxiety that you currently are experiencing. It will also help to prevent anxiety.When you speak to your parents, be direct about asking them to see a mental health professional. By speaking to your parents you are advocating for yourself which is exactly how you should be handling this situation. I hope you’re able to receive the help that you desire. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve always had problems with my mom and grandma. I don’t know why but I guess we just don’t get along. To them, I’m like a disgrace pretty much. They make it seem as if I am worthless and stupid. It seriously hurts me but angers me about our relationship. Every since I turned 15, the whole being a teenager thing hit me. I did almost everything a crazy teen would. I would party; go out all the time, basically, never at home. Then when I hit 18, I found someone that I truly love. We dated before but things didn’t work out as planned. OH and I forgot to mention, I dropped out at 16. I was really lazy I guess. Didn’t know what to do with myself and seriously felt like I had no one. . And yes, till this day. I still feel like I don’t have anyone. But back to the boyfriend. My boyfriend and I have been good on and off for a while. We both aren’t the best people. We have good hearts but job and school wise? We’re getting there. Its just overall, my boyfriend and I have been going through some hard times. It’s hard for me to say this but we use to be very abusive to one another. . And that’s where this leads to my family. I’ve never made the right choices in life. I don’t know if it’s just my luck or me. I really don’t know. I sort of feel like I don’t know what or myself I really want. I don’t know how to build myself up and make my family happy. My boyfriend and I had a huge fight and I broke my hand from that. My grandma was the first to find out and she was furious! Before my family didn’t really like him but they dealt with him. But ever since that fight, they HATE HIM! Pretty much, I feel like I am stuck between the three as in my boyfriend, family, and myself. I love them all but the depression and the stress they put me through is seriously tearing me apart. I know this might seem like an easy problem but to me, this problem runs my life as of right now. I lost my job, I’m trying to get back to school but I just can’t seem to know how to get back up. I’m very very confused. [/INST]  I can appreciate the turmoil in your life and hope my response can help sort things through. At 19 the work in front of you now is to focus on figuring out who you are becoming and what you need to do with school and work. The confusion is because you haven’t found your own inner strength and resources. Your family and your boyfriend aren’t the kind of nurturance you need. Turn your focus toward finding out what you want to do with your life, what you are good at, and how you may be able to use your talents to help others.I would encourage you to take this free strength survey to find out what your character strengths are and to start using them. Second, I would look to find a counselor who might help you sort through this confusion. The find help tab at the top of the page should help.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am a young boy. I listen to heavy metal (Ozzy Osborne and Marilyn Manson). I have a younger brother. My main problem is that I am very short (144cm) and everybody else in my age is tall, and I always think about become a king/emperor/leader and cutting off the legs of everybody who is taller than me so that they would be shorter. I cannot stop thinking about it, even in my dreams I always see blood and people without legs/people bowing down at my feet. I feel like all my “friends” secretly laugh at my height and that everybody hates me. My friends call me crazy sometimes. I also once almost killed my friend, when I was listening to music, I lost control of myself and I started strangling my best friend – I was stopped by another one of my friends and then I calmed down. My mother called me crazy for the first time when I smeared my whole face in my own blood. She thinks that I am mental and that I need to see a doctor. Am I really crazy or is it just “puberty”? [/INST]  The behavior you describe is quite serious and not likely the result of puberty. The only way in which biology or puberty affects this situation is related to height. At 11 years old, you are “short” now but you will grow taller. Growth spurts among males typically occur between the ages of 10 and 15. Your height may not be fully determined until at least 16 or 17 years old, and maybe later.I agree with your mother. It would be in your best interest to see a mental health professional. What’s most concerning is that you once lost control of yourself and attempted to strangle your best friend. It’s a definitive sign that you have the capacity to lose control and engage in violence. The concern is that such an event will happen again and you may seriously harm or kill another individual.Tell your mother you wrote this letter and show her my response. Insist that she take you to see a mental health professional. Treatment can greatly assist you in learning how to cope with your emotions and to develop healthy behaviors. Please take care. </s>"

I was wondering if a therapist would help them. I know there are counseling groups specifically for this, but I don’t know of any in Minnesota. How should he approach his mother about this? He is a minor, and a parent would have to accompany him for his first appointment, and pay for it, and sign him up in the first place. [/INST] I’m sorry. It would be unethical for me to provide a diagnosis on the basis of a letter. Please consider going back to your therapist to talk about your concerns. If she submitted a bill to an insurance company, she most likely had to assign a diagnosis.Please bear in mind that any diagnosis is only helpful if it informs treatment. It is not intended to label you. What you are describing may be the product of a very active and creative imagination and not necessarily a mental illness.

"<s>[INST] I am a secretary in a private elementary school. Two years ago the former principal retired. She was a nun who had very deep ties to the community considering she had been principal since the 60s. The new principal is a lay person who came from a completely different diocese (an “outsider”), however she is a professional whereas the former principal played favorites. Since the change two mothers have become verbally abusive to the current administrator, myself, and others. Furthermore, they do this in front of the children and other parents and they spread malicious gossip and rumors. It is escalating and my boss just shrugs her shoulders and says “oh well.” I have been employed here for 8 years and I have never had problems with these two mothers (or anyone for that matter) before the retirement of the former principal. This issue needs to be resolved.  [/INST] A: I’m sorry that you have encountered this problem and that these parents are making your job difficult. I think the approach you have outlined is a good one, most likely the best one, but you also need to understand that for some folks just “listening” isn’t what they want and it could get worse if they feel that you have also become a part of the problem (i.e. listening to their concerns but not doing anything about them).I also know that verbal abuse is not allowable in any work place. If their complaints truly escalate to the point of you feeling abused or harassed, you need to address it with them directly and let them know that it is inappropriate and that you will only hear them out if they can speak respectfully. If this approach doesn’t work, you should take it to your superiors and to the human resources department, school board, etc. I’m not sure of the chain of command in a private school, but there has to be a system in place to handle these sorts of issues. Don’t hesitate to use it because not only does this negatively affect you and the school morale, but I agree that children often hear and observe things that we don’t think they do.All the best, </s>"

Untreated trust issues could severely damage your relationship with your husband.I agree that having a therapist would probably be helpful. I also agree that forums can be reassuring but don’t necessarily provide the kind of personalized and professional support that you may need.

"<s>[INST] I suppose the issue I am having now, directly relates to issues from my childhood; so I’ll start there. My parents separated when I was pretty young, so I grew up in a single parent household. Which, surprisingly, is not the problem. My mother has OCD (along with other emotional problems). We were never allowed to be sad, or mad, or anything else that wasn’t happy. She would literally get angry with us. “What’s wrong with you?” she would say in a disgusted tone. She yelled a lot. [/INST]  The way I see it, you and your husband are cooperating in this argument. Instead of dealing productively with whatever the issue was, the two of you got completely distracted and derailed by an argument about what’s fair to bring up in an argument. It makes me wonder what was so difficult about the original issue that you went off on such a painful tangent.Yes, you have baggage. Who doesn’t? My guess is that you could find something to pin your husband’s defensiveness on. Yes. It’s a betrayal of sorts whenever someone we trust uses something they know about us to hurt us – or to defend themselves. But arguing about that will only continue the argument about an argument. You can react without overreacting. If there’s a next time, simply calmly say something like “I’m sure we could go down that road but we’ve got a problem to solve. Is there something about it that is too upsetting?” Stick with the topic at hand and you’ll find out more about each other.Meanwhile, I’m sorry that your mother wasn’t able to tolerate any emotional variation in her kids. That must have been very, very hard. As a kid, you couldn’t do much to change it but you can now. I think it’s long past time to refer her to another therapist. You can’t forge a close mother-daughter relationship as long as you take the role of a combination counselor and parent. No wonder you’re exhausted! If your mother won’t go initially, make an appointment for yourself and do some groundwork. Then you and the therapist can invite her to join you. Gradually, your therapist can help you shift over the responsibility for your mom so that you two can start to have some fun together.

"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: Two years and seven months ago I started really looking at who I was and now I don’t know who I am anymore. I have gone through thinking I was heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual. Now I have no sexual interests in any way. [/INST]  You are a man in anguish. That does not make you psychotic. I wish there was something I could say to help you stop worrying about what everyone else thinks and start taking care of yourself.Twin relationships can be joyful but they also can be terribly complicated, especially when the personalities are more different than appearances. Sometimes twins unconsciously develop opposite ways of being in the world just to have their own identities. It’s the obvious solution. It certainly makes the point that the two people are different. But sometimes people take it too far. They don’t do this on purpose. It just happens. There are more subtle and more satisfying ways to be your own self than to be a mirror image of your brother. I think you need help finding them.The way out of this is to see a therapist. I hope you can reconsider it. Yes, we therapists do see people with significant mental illness. But we also see people who are the “worried well” — people who are not mentally ill but who are troubled and who need the objective eyes and the information and support we can offer. You fit into that group. I am concerned that if you continue to withdraw and spin around and around in the same tortured thoughts, you will become ever more depressed. You need someone to help you break through the spin and start you on a path toward healthy self-discovery.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Well I’m gay and I stopped denying it recently. I always known that there’s something different with me, though. I hate it and I’m so afraid because everybody around me says awful things about gays. I am unhappy and I have strong feeling that I will stay that way and in 20 years I see myself miserable and alone. Worse thing is that I hate the way my character is. I put myself down all the time because I’m not strong, I care too much about other people opinions and I see myself generally unlikable. Being gay only complicates things by miles. My parents are conservative and curse gays when something about them is on TV. One day when I come out they MAY accept it as some time passes by but deep down I know they will be ashamed of me. And I read some stuff that homosexuality is inherited so I can’t stop thinking about my dad being gay in the closet too. Every thing he does that jumps out of something that straight man would do is bugging me so hard. My mom is something like tomboy and it is a weird combination. If he turns out to be gay (which I suppose I will never find out) I think I couldn’t handle it. A lot of stuff is going on my mind, a lot of possible scenarios and it is giving me so much stress.

"<s>[INST] I’m a 13 year old girl and I’m a very violent, sadistic, unempathetic person. I’ve had very violent desires and urges ever since I can remember, and in recent years, it’s also become sexual. To put it simply, I want to kill people, I want to see them suffer, and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t get sexual gratification from doing so. When I was younger, and even a little bit now, I would try to hurt animals. I would throw things at them, try to run them over with a dirt bike, and would tear any bugs I found limb from limb, along with other things. I would even plot to murder my parents when I was around 8. I’m not saying I don’t do that now, but I fully intended on following through with my plans back then. I would pack a backpack, wait until my parents were asleep, and sneak knives into my room. I’ve never had much empathy, and the amount I do have has been gradually decreasing over the years. I have decent cognitive empathy, but I have no affective empathy, nor do I feel sympathy at all. In fact, for the longest time, I actually thought the words “I feel bad for you” was just an expression. I’ve never felt for another person, or at least, not for a very long time. I don’t care about other people, nor do I form emotional attachments with others. Thanks for any help. [/INST]  Your violent desires and urges are very concerning. Desiring to hurt others is not normal. Most people don’t feel that way. It’s good that you recognize these feelings as being problematic. Solving a problem first requires acknowledgment. It is an important first step.It’s also worrisome that you have tried to hurt animals. Not only is it morally wrong, but it’s illegal. If caught, you could be charged with a serious crime. The federal government has recently increased the penalties for people convicted of hurting animals. The Federal Bureau of investigation (FBI) considers animal abuse a “crime against society.” It is often a precursor to serious criminal behavior. People who hurt animals might also hurt people.Some communities have created a registry of animal abusers. Much like sex offender registries, people convicted of hurting animals are placed on the registry and barred from owning animals. These registries are publicly accessible so that community members can keep their animals away from dangerous people.In order to protect yourself against future legal trouble, I would strongly advise that you consult a mental health professional. Ask your parents to help you find a therapist. A clinical evaluation will determine if something is wrong. Most importantly, the therapist will then create a treatment plan to address your problematic behavior.Finally, if you feel that you are a danger to yourself or to others, call the authorities. They can protect you from doing something that you would regret. Hurting people and animals could lead to your arrest and severe punishment. Treatment could help you immensely. It has the potential to positively alter your course in life. Please take care. </s>"

When she got there I was calmed down. She came in the bathroom where I was and told me she was tired of my drama and why didn’t i just kill myself. So being in the mental state I was in I ran into the bedroom and grabbed a pistol, that I thought was unloaded. was told it was unloaded. She and my son wrestled the gun from my hand and i locked myself in the bathroom. She called ems and I was involuntarily committed. I was let go the next day. She can’t understand why I’m mad at that and says I’m unforgiving. [/INST] Let’s start with some basics. A pistol being that available should be one of the first things you attend to. As you are going through the need for medication and the potential results, let’s err on the side of caution and get guns out of reach — in a locked cabinet if you still want them in the house.Your mother’s reaction to your need tells us a lot about her. She cannot be the person you rely on in an emergency. Get a list of nearby people you can trust who can be there for you in a crisis and let your son (and others in the house) know who they are. List those numbers near all the phones and plug them into yours and your children’s cell phones.I would highly recommend these precautions now and plan to meet with a family therapist. You can find a qualified person near you here. You will want to sort through what happened with this therapist. Your mom needs to be educated on how to help and not escalate a situation. She is the one that aggravated the situation to dramatic heights by inciting you while you were in your state.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I am in a mild state of mania right now and am on manic spending sprees. This started a couple of months ago when I bought a whole new wardrobe which I needed because I have lost 77 pounds in the last year. This triggered my manic spending. I am totally out of control and have already racked up more than $2000 in credit card debt. I fear it will be a lot more if I can’t stop. I cannot take antipsychotic drugs because I have tardive dyskinesia. I have seen therapists in the past but didn’t feel like I was getting much help. I really need help. My husband doesn’t know how much I am spending and I am terrified he’ll find out. [/INST]  I’m sure it is terrifying to feel so out of control. But I think you may have at least a bit more control than you think you do. The manic spending may have been triggered by the need to buy new clothes, but you are maintaining it by not confiding in your husband. That is a decision you are making. You can do much towards empowering yourself by deciding to talk to him instead.I’m assuming that you have had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder before this, so it won’t be new information to your husband that you can get into a manic spin. Of course he will be disappointed. He may even be angry. But getting in deeper will only result in bigger disappointment and anger. Asking for help will get you back on the same team with your partner.Then go back to therapy. Ask your doctor for a referral to a mental health counselor who specializes in bipolar disorders. Not all therapists are alike. Not every therapist is a good fit for every client. Interview a few therapists until you find one you can respect and stick with.Meanwhile on a practical level: Make it more difficult for yourself to spend. Cut up credit cards. Take your name off your family bank account. Don’t go to stores. Don’t go online to catalogues. (If you can’t resist, make it difficult for yourself to get on a computer.) Confide in friends who may be shopping buddies and ask them to help you keep away from temptation. Ask your husband to take over the family finances for now. Ask him or a friend to take back anything that still has a tag on it.If you can’t enlist the support of your husband, you have a different problem. Then the spending may be a way that you are putting distance between you and your husband. If that’s the case, you need marriage counseling as well as help for the manic state.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: It all started 4 years ago in 6th grade. I transferred to a new school because it had a really good magnet program. I used to make A-B honor roll every year until then. I began get C’s on my report card and my mom began to act differently towards me. She yelled at me more and blamed me for almost everything. After that I have been getting C’s and no matter what I do my mom still treats me badly. Even if she sees this I might get into a lot of trouble. [/INST]  I’m so sorry you are in such despair. Sadly, not everyone gets the family they want and deserve. You may be right that there is something about you that reminds your mom about mistakes she has made. She may somehow believe that if she could erase you from her life, or if you were 100% perfect, her problems would disappear. She may not even be aware that she is taking something out on you that you have no control over. She apparently doesn’t understand that she’s the only one who can correct whatever mistakes she has made. You have nothing to do with it.It sounds like she thinks how you do in school is a reflection on her. I want you to know that you are not alone in your problems with your studies. Often when kids transfer from a low-performing school to a better school, their grades drop. That’s because their old school didn’t give them the preparation they need to do well in the new one. You are not stupid. You are unprepared for this level of work. It’s like starting a race 50 feet behind everyone else. It’s going to take time and effort to catch up. It’s to your credit that you tried in-school tutoring. Good for you! You need more of it.Your best help can come from your teachers. Ask a teacher you trust to talk to your mom about how hard the transition has been for you. The teacher can then give you both practical suggestions for how to help you do better. Don’t give up. The work is worth it. Even getting Cs in a better school means you are getting a better education than in your old school. Working at it will prepare you for getting more education if you want it.Meanwhile, if you need someone to talk to to get some support, you can always call the Boys and Girls Town Hotline. Counselors are available 24/7 to talk to kids like you about their problems. It’s free and confidential. Their number is 1-800-448-3000.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Columbia: My friend dated this guy for about 3 months (never meet him as I was overseas), he took her virginity and a while later they broke up. They kept talking and the new girlfriend of the guy called her to say to stay away, later my friend discovered that he was with the new girlfriend on the same time period he was with her. [/INST]  As frustrating as this is for you, there is little more you can do. Your friend is an adult and is making her own decision. All you can do is love her and be there when she finally comes to her senses.I worry that she keeps going back because he is the first man she had sex with. Sometimes, in situations like this, the woman keeps returning to what passes for a relationship to justify having made the decision to have sex. He didn’t “take” her virginity. They had consensual sex that she may now regret. She may be putting far too much importance on this guy having been her first.If that’s the case, you can perhaps reassure her that the first time she has sex isn’t as important as the first time she has sex with someone who loves and cherishes her. This guy isn’t worth her time, her love, or her regrets.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My brother’s wife had a stroke about a year ago. He is completely devoted to her. She has partial paralysis and slight trouble with speech. A few months after the stroke, she started accusing my brother of having an affair with a woman that lives 300 miles away. She’s now decided that the woman has moved a few houses away from them. She also thinks that he’s having affairs with every woman in the town and everyone they see while they’re together out of town. She will even say things like, “Who are you going to see on that plane?” When the plane she is talking about is flying over them. She is a registered nurse, and although she is doing these things at home, and making life totally miserable for him day and night, she evidently can put on a perfect act at every doctor’s visit. They all seem to think she’s doing fine, when we all know she’s not. She refuses to let anyone go to a doctor visit with her, to really tell how things are. What can he do? If he can’t legally force her to get help, what can he do to help her, or more importantly now, what can he do to help himself? He’s been dealing with this for months. [/INST]  Studies show that psychosis is a possible complication of a stroke but it’s rare, with an incident rate of about 1 percent. Her delusion seems to be very focused. She might have what is called delusional jealousy. A set of German researchers documented a rare case of a stroke victim who experienced delusional jealousy, a syndrome which they referred to as “organic Othello syndrome.”In their 2012 case study, they describe a 49-year-old female with no history of psychiatric illness who had a stroke and subsequently developed the delusion that her husband was having an affair with one of her friends. The authors reported that she was unshakable in her beliefs despite there being no evidence to support her accusation. The alleged affair made her very upset to the point where she would angrily throw household items at her husband. She demonstrated no other psychiatric symptoms. The authors theorized that her symptoms might have been the result of brain damage suffered from the stroke. Typical treatments for post-stroke psychosis include psychotropic medications.It’s important that your brother immediately report these symptoms to her doctor. Though she does allow him to go to the doctor with her, that doesn’t preclude him from contacting her doctor. He could either call or write a letter detailing her symptoms and his concerns. The doctor might not be able to respond, given health privacy laws, but there’s nothing that prevents your brother from contacting her doctor and reporting his concerns.Your brother should also ask the doctor for advice about how to handle this situation. He or she might be in the best position to help your brother and his wife.In the interim, there are some resources that may be of assistance to your brother in dealing with the accusations. Dr. Xavier Amador has written a good book that many people have found helpful called I Am Not Sick I Don’t Need Help: How To Help Someone With Mental Illness Accept Treatment. The book provides practical advice for families dealing with a loved one who is experiencing a break with reality.Hopefully, once her doctor is made aware of the problem, he or she will be able to help. If not, your brother may want to consult other health care professionals who specialize in psychosis or organic brain disorders. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m 20 years old and scared that I’m a pedophile. It started a few weeks ago. I was watching a movie when I saw a little girl on screen and felt a shift in my penis. I don’t know if it was an erection or what but, it terrified me. [/INST]  You are quite literally making yourself crazy. If I told you that under no certain terms you are NOT to think about white alligators, it would be almost impossible for you to clear your mind of white alligators. As a matter of fact, you might become obsessed with keeping white alligators out of your mind, which would mean that you were thinking about them constantly.I can’t, of course, absolutely rule out sexual deviance on the basis of a letter. But I have a strong suspicion that your worry about pedophilia is like a worry about white alligators.At this point, you have upset yourself so much, you probably need some help to get out of the cycle of disturbing ideas.I suggest you take a copy of your letter and this response to a licensed therapist and have a frank discussion about your anxiety and how to manage it.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am “in love” with a celebrity male, 29 years older than me. Since I was ten, before I knew his name, I was sexually obsessed with him. That obsession later turned into this “relationship” I made up. I have lost myself, believing that we have many things in common, and that he really loves me even though we never meet. I feel like I will never get over this. I am in a happy relationship now, for over a year, but these sexually desires for this celebrity keep coming back. I come up with these fantasies that his children will love me, his friends want us to be together. I have had a fantasy that he has been looking for me his whole life. I can’t stop. [/INST]  It’s wonderful that you’re wanting to get to the bottom of your obsession by reaching out for help. In order to figure out why this fantasy relationship has such a hold on you, I urge you to dig deeper and discover what this celebrity represents to you, emotionally and relationally. It sounds like in this fantasy love relationship you feel desired, special, treasured, accepted, and embraced by someone special — the very things that we all long for and look for in our love relationships. The problem isn’t in wanting those things, but in holding on to a fantasy that will never really satisfy your needs instead of finding ways to get your emotional needs met in real-life relationships. The intensity of your fantasy and the large age difference between you and and this celebrity makes me suspect that you have a “hole in your soul” regarding an important male relationship in your early life that needs some attention and healing.Here are a few questions to help you start looking deeper and start to discover what this fantasy is really about and why it is so intense and long-lasting.As you sort through your emotions your fantasies will still continue to surface. When they do I recommend framing them in a non-judgmental way that includes identifying what the desires are really about. For example, you might say to yourself, “Hello celebrity obsession. Thanks for letting me know that I still have some emotional healing to do when it comes to my male relationships. I’m working on that. Goodbye” After acknowledging the fantasy, don’t focus on it, but turn to your current relationship for connection and comfort.If I had more information about your relationship history I could help you make more sense of your obsession. Since I don’t, please consider seeking a counselor to help you get to the emotional root of your obsession and begin to heal your unmet needs.

"<s>[INST] Can you point towards resources for navigating rare cases of carefully considered, consensual, post-therapy romantic relationships between client and therapist? Very rarely, there are legitimate cases of two people wanting to be above board in their pursuit of a relationship. Should we not have resources and guidelines for such situations? [/INST]  I find your question to be highly confusing. Let me explain. You are asking me, a licensed clinician, if there would be legal and licensure problems for the two of you to continue your relationship. I can understand why you would ask that of a licensed professional. That is not at all confusing. The confusing part is how I might’ve answered that question under those circumstances. I might have said “you should find a couple of licensed clinicians and ask for their professional advice.” And that is the very confusing part of the question that you have asked of me. According to your letter both you and the person that you are having a relationship with, are both licensed professional psychologists.I find it very confusing, and truly so, that two licensed clinicians would not know the answer to the question that you’ve asked of me. If neither of you were licensed clinicians, then I could well understand why you would want to consult with a licensed professional, after all it’s easier to write to someone on the internet than it would be to make an appointment and undergo the expense of consulting in person with a licensed therapist.But according to what you have clearly stated, you are both licensed psychologists. Why would my opinion or knowledge be greater than or better than your own? Perhaps I have completely missed the purpose and intent of your question and if so I apologize, but I truly am perplexed as to why two licensed professionals would feel unqualified to answer their own licensure or other psychology-based questions.Please allow me to add something that you have not asked. People fall in love all the time. It could be at the bus stop, at the coffee shop, at the office or the car repair shop. People fall in love. Can they fall in love at their therapist’s office? Of course, they can but is it real love or something that has resulted from the therapy?The therapist listens intently with deep and real concern. He or she does not do so because they are in love with the client or patient but do so because it is part of the therapy. However, to the client or patient, this displayed concern can be construed as a love relationship because after all in a normal, nonprofessional, relationship this type of displayed behavior would be indicative of someone loving or falling in love or at least caring about you.From the very beginning the client expects the therapist to have the answers and intentionally or unintentionally defers to the therapist. This is good, and perhaps essential to the therapeutic process but it is not good in a “normal” relationship. In a good relationship both parties must have equal power. Perhaps not in every area but when the relationship is considered in total, adding up the power scores for every area, in the end the power should be very close to equal.This is difficult to achieve when a movement from therapeutic relationship to personal relationship is attempted. You didn’t ask but I have included this because I think it is very cogent. Good luck. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi, Recently I’ve been dealing with intrusive thoughts and anxiety, but this is another matter. However, one thing giving tremendous guilt is that I’ve recently remembered some thoughts I had during puberty. During this time when I was probably around 13 or 14, I was very horny all of the time. I would get turned on by almost any female. What is giving me guilt is that there were a few occasions that even my mom turned me on a couple times! I felt guilty about it at the time, but it wasn’t that bad. I would masterbate to stop feeling so horny all of the time. I got over it though and haven’t been like that since then. [/INST]  Yes, what you are reporting is absolutely normal. As you said quite eloquently in your letter: At that time in your life, you were turned on by thinking of any female. It makes sense that you would get aroused by the woman in your life you most loved at the time.Fortunately, part of growing up is learning impulse control. As you got accustomed to your hormones and learned how to manage your physical feelings, your ability to manage your emotional feelings followed. You’ve now turned your attentions to women who are appropriate and available to you.Please stop feeling guilty about a normal chapter in your development.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I lost my dog about 3weeks ago she got hit by a car, she was the world to me. I suffer from depression and have always seen my life as pointless and having my dog gave me a reason to live. My dog and i were always together, when ever i was sad or upset she would cheer me up, she made getting out of bed worth it.Now that shes gone i find that everything reminds me of her because she was that big of a part of my life. There is not a sec that goes by that i dont miss her i feel like i miss her more every day. The worst part is the nightmares every night i dream about her dead over and over again and on some night i dream that my dog is crying out for me but no matter how hard i try to get to her i can’t. I feel horrible i dont know what to do i feel lost. [/INST]  I know this may sound counterintuitive and perhaps sacreligious but I would recommend adopting a new dog. Adopting a new dog does not mean that you would be replacing your old dog. No dog could replace the one that you just lost. Adopting a new dog gives you the opportunity to rescue an animal that doesn’t have a home. There are millions of animals just waiting to be adopted and to be given a loving home. They are waiting for your love.There’s an expression that may be appropriate here: “when one door closes another opens.” Reframing the situation may help to improve it. The loss of your dog may connect you with a new pet who is needing and deserving of your love.A client recently lost her beloved cat. She and her husband rescued the cat who was living on the side of a four-lane highway. They described their new cat as being their favorite. They had many cats in the past but this one was particularly special. Unfortunately, she died after approximately a year. They were devastated. After a few days, they adopted a new kitten. In part, the adoption was motivated by an attempt to fill the void of their recent loss. At first, they felt guilty about replacing their beloved cat so quickly. That guilt quickly diminished after experiencing the joy of having rescued a homeless kitten. They now view the loss of their beloved cat as having “opened the door” to their new kitten. Metaphorically speaking, their deceased cat “gave birth” to their new kitten. You have the opportunity to save another dog.I wish you the best luck. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in South Africa: So from what other people have told me, I’m not exactly considered normal. People often seem to find my behaviour odd. I’m very introverted. I spend days at a time sitting in my room without anyone else, and I’ve had full blown conversations with myself for hours on end while doing so. I tend to talk to myself very often, even in public without realising it. Usually I recite the numbers “1 2 9 10 5 9” if I realise that I’m talking to myself in public because I start to panic and think people are going to think I’m strange even when no one has noticed. It’s something that’s been happening for a long time now where i will suddenly just say something out loud and realise that I said it and a sudden panic comes over me so I recite those numbers to calm myself down, sometimes I add other random numbers between 1 and 10 as well. [/INST]   If you could stop your “bad habits” you would have done so long ago. I can’t diagnose you on the basis of a letter, of course. But I can tell you that from what you wrote, you do have serious problems that 1) need to be addressed if you are to have a satisfying and happy life and 2) that are treatable.Although your behaviors meet the criteria for several different diagnoses, I do wonder if maybe you are on the high functioning end of the autism spectrum (either instead or or in addition to whatever other diagnoses have been assigned to you). If that has not be explored, please do get an evaluation.I think you already know that therapy would be helpful. I also encourage you to get involved with group, as well as individual, treatment. Group therapy provides a safe place to talk about your issues with others and to get feedback from other members of the group about what you do that distances you from others and how to correct that. A good group becomes an important support while the members learn more about themselves in interaction with others and rehearse new behaviors.Please take care of yourself. Stop obsessing about all that is “wrong” with you and get the treatment you need to discover and bring out all that is “right.” As a starting point, you might find it reassuring to take the Strengths assessment at http://www.viacharacter.org/www/Character-Strengths-Survey. Once you know your personal character strengths, you can build on them to improve your outlook and your life.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I want to know if anything is wrong with me. I crave attention, positive or negative and have done for many years. Over the past year i’ve started to have depressive episodes in which i contemplate hurting myself, and have done, but only minor things to get attention or to avoid having to do something (feel stressed due to being anxious about situations) ive even contemplated killing myself once, though i was under the influence of alcohol, but without the intention of ever commencing the act as i couldn’t do something like that as it would hurt the people i love. i feel ashamed of being like this as i come from a loving family and have great friends and a great life so why do i feel this way!?! [/INST] It is human nature to desire attention. Attention is validating. It is a way of letting us know that we matter to someone. Children in particular need attention. When they do not receive it, they may act inappropriately to receive it. The same is true with teenagers. If they do not receive an appropriate amount of attention, they too may misbehave.“Acting out” might be your way of ensuring that someone pays attention to you. Harming yourself is physical evidence that your desire for attention is real. Self-injury ensures that those around you will see your pain. Thus self-harm may be a form of “guaranteed attention” but it is a misguided approach to meeting your needs.My main concern about your behavior is self-injury. Self-injury is, by definition, self-destructive. An additional concern is your contemplation of ending your life. Thankfully you have decided otherwise but that might not always be the case. Your behavior may progress to the point where you lose control, especially if you are intoxicated. These are serious issues that you should take seriously, since they involve your physical self and being.You stated that you are ashamed of your behavior. Shame might hinder you from receiving the appropriate mental health treatment. Many people have struggled with the same problems. Your depression, anxiety and self-harm need to be treated. You should see a mental health professional (you can find one through our therapist directory if needed). Even though I realize it may not be easy, I think it’s important that you find a way to speak to your parents, report these problems, and request that they assist you in finding the appropriate mental health care. Please take care. </s>"

While I can’t diagnose you in this forum, you do need to be seen and evaluated by a physician or mental health therapist ASAP.  How brave of you to reach out to your mom for help, and I’m sorry she didn’t take you seriously. Did you tell your mom about the depth of your hopelessness, your self-harm, and how much you hate yourself? Please reach out to her again and be completely honest with her about the depth of your despair so she can feel the urgency. Sometimes parents don’t know how to handle a child’s emotional pain.

I’m scared and I need your help. Please take me to the doctor or therapist.” If your mom doesn’t understand depression or mental illnesses, you may want to have her read some of the resources on PsychCentral so she has a deeper understanding of what you’re going through. If your mom still doesn’t respond to you, please reach out to a school counselor or another trusted relative for help. There is help and treatment for the symptoms that you’re describing.

"<s>[INST] From when I was 8 years old my parents were in a ‘Swingers’ Club. They did this openly in front of me and my siblings. They held meetings at alternating homes of members. The night it was at my home we were told to stay in our rooms. I couldn’t stay in my room as it was used to put members babies so I stayed in my brothers room. My mother came in naked to show us how she had been body painted. I’d also seen a photo of her that she showed me from a previous party with her naked and painted. [/INST]  Abuse in childhood can and often does have a negative effect on development. Good parenting can have an avalanche effect. One positive action can affect hundreds or perhaps thousands of other areas of the child’s life. Unfortunately, a similar truth exists for those who experience poor parenting. Poor parenting creates a negative avalanche effect. Parenting is critically important in the development of a psychologically healthy individual.The easiest and most efficient way to deal with this problem is to go to counseling. You’ve tried counseling with your parents and it was unsuccessful. It was worth a try but it didn’t work. Individual counseling would be a much better option for you at this time. At some point during the counseling process it may be advantageous to confront your parents. No apology, no matter how profound or sincere, can change the past and the emotional pain that you have endured. You cannot change your past but you can change the future and counseling can help you to do this. It is important to understand that while you have been damaged by your childhood, healing is possible. Others have been successful and you can too. You are considering suicide because your emotional pain and suffering is so great but please understand that suicide is never the answer. It takes time and therapy is a process but personal growth and healing is the expected outcome.I am so sorry that you had to endure the things that you wrote about. It was unfair, terribly unfair. Many people have undergone severe childhood abuse. No one that I am aware of has endured this abuse and been left unscarred. However, every case that I am aware of has responded very well to counseling and almost all of these victims of childhood abuse are all now leading happy, successful lives.Good luck in your efforts. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a young man int he U.S.:  I’m 26 years old disabled and my mother controls everything and lies about everything. I need help. My disabilities are depression, anxiety, PTSD. She won’t let me go anywhere without her, she won’t let me have anyone over at my house any more, she won’t let me drive anywhere anymore. I feel trapped. [/INST] If you were manipulated out of signing the deed for a home you paid for, it seems to me that it would be helpful to see a lawyer who specializes in disability law. You are essentially being held hostage in your own home. It’s your house. She doesn’t get to set house rules for a 26-year-old man who is letting her share his home. She doesn’t get to decide whether you can drive a car you paid for. Being disabled doesn’t mean that you don’t have the same rights as any other adult.Taking all you said at face value: It looks to me that your mother is, in fact, the dependent one. If you assert your rights to your home, where is she going to go? One way to keep her home is to make sure you don’t meet someone to marry. If you go places without her, you just might meet someone to love. She would then have competition for your affection and for your loyalty.At this point, the problem isn’t your mother. It’s that you have given her far too much power. Her threats and rules only mean something if you go along with them. You’ve been so beaten down that you have lost the ability to stand up for yourself. If that’s the case, find a lawyer. Then find a therapist to help you learn how to assert some boundaries with your mother.On the other hand: I don’t have enough information to know if just maybe your mother’s worries are warranted. You didn’t share whether you have done things that make her behavior make a kind of sense. What looks like control could be protection. If you’ve behaved in such a way that she is justified in thinking you aren’t capable of managing a house or driving responsibly, that changes everything. In that case, my best suggestion is that you go together to a family therapist to help the two of you figure out what you need to do so that she feels comfortable with letting go.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My life is currently a disaster. I understand other people have it worse. Physically, I am blessed. I have a roof over my head, food to eat, transportation, a supportive family, an amazing church, and a helpful therapist (who is both a mental health counselor as well as a drug and alcohol counselor) who truly seems to care. During a very recent hospitalization, I also began utilizing a journal to get my thoughts out in a private manner. I have an incredible support system I rarely utilize. I am struggling with a number of issues. I suck at reaching out before making terrible decisions such as self harm and drug use. I am an alcoholic and a drug addict who attends AA meetings regularly but have yet to pick up my 24-hour chip. I feel as if I’m not ready to surrender and work a program. I am, however, terrified of the consequences of alcoholism/drug use. Another fellowship I was previously a member of states these consequences at the start of every meeting: jails, institutions, and death. I lost one of my best friends in March to addiction. I have also seen many others lose their lives. While heroin is not my DOC, I feel as though any substance I choose to use will inevitably lead to some kind of consequence. I am in such a conundrum. That is the only word I can think of to describe this mess known as my life. Following the worst inpatient experience of my life, I am also struggling with the emotional pain of being on a very small amount of numerous medications. I am on the starting doses of these meds which have not nearly reached a therapeutic level. I feel as though I am mentally and emotionally unstable, as is proven by my recent words and actions towards others. This has caused others pull away, possibly permanently. I owe amends I’m not ready to give. As a member of AA, I believe in the ninth step. That is a step I struggled with a lot, though. There were a lot of repeated amends by mouth, but no changed behavior. It was unintentional lip service. I was and still am unsure of how to change my behavior. My next issue has to do with the job I just lost on Monday and the rest of the issues I haven’t discussed that were a result of this volcano that has just erupted. A few weeks ago, I put my two weeks notice in at a job I had worked at for three weeks shy of a year. I was burned out on working with the general public, so going back is not an option. I had just been offered a contracted cleaning job. So for my last two weeks of work at my old job, I worked both jobs. This was not a good decision. I was simultaneously feeling suicidal due to just being put on Latuda. I could not get ahold of my psychiatrist, so after just two weeks of working a brand new job, i found it necessary to go inpatient before I made a fatal decision. Following being inpatient, they told me at my new job that while I had been out of work for two weeks, they had to fill my position. I burned bridges, lost my sponsor as a result of using the day they let me go, and cut myself for the first time in two years. I feel too unstable to try to obtain and maintain employment at this time. I will not be able to pass a drug test at the moment. Not having a job leaves me with a ton of time on my hands. I am torn between applying for SSI and SSD and looking for a new job (in a few weeks.) This leaves me with no income. I am blessed to live with a parent who provides for me. I don’t really understand the point of sharing all of this. I am the one who needs to make some changes and decisions. [/INST]  The fact that you have a supportive parent who allows you to live in their home, despite your continued drug use and problematic decision-making, might actually be doing you a disservice. It essentially means that they are giving you a pass when you make mistakes. In other words, it’s a classic case of enabling. Tough love is the antidote to enabling.They may be serving as a buffer and preventing you from having to face the full range of consequences for your behavior. For example, if you were living paycheck to paycheck, as many people do, I highly doubt you would have quit your job simply because you were “burned out” from working with the public. Many people would quit their jobs if given the option, but they simply can’t do it because quitting is a luxury that they cannot afford. You can afford that luxury.In reality, you have a large number of luxuries (i.e., roof over your head, food, transportation, etc.) that you acknowledge but may fail to fully appreciate.I am not suggesting that it would be better for you not to have the aforementioned life benefits but they may be preventing you from doing what is necessary to fix your life. In other words, you haven’t faced serious life-altering consequences yet.You said that you “suck at reaching out before making terrible decisions such as self-harm and drug use.” Could it be because you don’t want to reach out during those times because you’d rather indulge in those particular behaviors? You could have reached out but you decided not to do so.It’s important to recognize that, in those instances, you were making a choice. You could have easily made the alternative decision but you chose not to do the right thing. It was not because you didn’t know what the right choice was; you knew but chose not to do the right thing. You made a choice. We all have choices in life and you, at the moments you have described, were choosing. Sometimes you have to do things you do not want to do, even if they are unpleasant and not preferable. That is part of life.Perhaps, the heart of the problem is that you are not ready to change. You may not be ready to give up drug use. Many people enjoy using drugs. They like to party. Using drugs feels good and they have fun when they are high. Being high means that you don’t have to think about life problems. Drug use is an escape.In many respects, it’s easier to use drugs than it is to deal with life. Life problems are difficult and often painful. Drugs numb the pain and allow one to put off dealing with the realities of life, for another hour or day. It is easier to use drugs and escape life but it is also immensely destructive. It is easier to simply get high when you feel like it but typically the easier choice is the wrong choice.In AA, certainly you’ve heard discussion of the concept of hitting “rock bottom.” Perhaps you have not hit “rock bottom.” In an ideal world, you wouldn’t have to hit “rock bottom” in order to change. It’s important that you don’t take for granted the many “luxuries” that you currently have in your life. If you do and continue to indulge your urges, then you may be forced to “learn the hard way,” i.e. to hit rock bottom, in order to realize important life lessons. You don’t want to have to “learn the hard way” if you can avoid it. Many drug users do not survive making the wrong choice.Realize that you already have all of the elements you need for success in your life right now. Utilize them, don’t take them for granted and hopefully this will save you from having to “learn the hard way,” which, as you’re reminded at the beginning of every AA meeting, involves death, jail or institutions.You might try reading the book The Road Less Traveled by M. Scott Peck. He discusses many of the issues that you have described. Thank you for your question. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I am a single mother of a three year old having some trouble with my ex-fiance and the father of my child. [/INST]  Being a father is about more than biology. It is a responsibility! You were absolutely right to leave the relationship. He wasn’t taking responsibility then. He isn’t now.If he wants things to be “fair”, he needs to man up and provide financial support. He needs to win your trust, not demand it.If he pays a reasonable child support regularly and without whining for a year, then maybe you can consider whether to encourage a relationship with your daughter. I’d start with limited time with you there to see how he handles taking care of a toddler. And, no, it’s not okay for him to involve his girlfriend. He needs to show you he can take good care of a child without relying on someone else.Don’t let this guy guilt-trip you. From what you wrote, it sounds to me that he is more interested in “winning” an argument with you than loving his child.I wish you well  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Lately I haven’t been feeling like myself… It’s like I’m more depressed than I normally am. I have always had depression, ever since I was in 7th grade. I would deal with it by cutting myself, and I have been wanting to do it again for no reason. I have caused numerous scratches, not actual cuts. I’ve been battling with myself. I do not sleep much, and when I do sleep it is for at least 10 hours. I have also had a few suicide attempts in the past… And lately I keep thinking about them and remembering them. I don’t want to be around anyone, but then I do, but then I don’t again. When I’m around my friends I feel as though I’m not there. I’m just watching me from the inside, like I’m a soul in a machine. I keep on having nightmares, and dreams about places I’ve never been to… But then a few days later I’ll be at the place I dreamed about. I don’t what’s wrong with me… I was wondering if you could give me a suggestion on what I should do, or what is possibly wrong with me. I feel sick. [/INST] I’m very, very glad you wrote. It’s so important to reach out for help when you’re feeling this way. I can’t offer a diagnosis on the basis of only a letter, of course. But I can venture that with a history of depression and the symptoms you’re reporting it’s very likely that the depression has returned.What you should do is see a mental health counselor, preferably someone who is familiar with your case, for a thorough evaluation. It would also be a good idea to see your primary care physician for a complete physical exam if you haven’t had one for awhile. There are a number of medical problems that can look like depression.What’s most important is that you stop thinking about getting help and start doing it. There’s no shame in reaching for help when you’re feeling sick. You are not overreacting or being too needy or whatever negative things you tell yourself. You’re simply not feeling like your normal self. Please follow through and make those appointments. In a few short weeks you could be feeling much, much better.According to TeensHealth’s website, there are some things you can start to do to work on healing your depression. They say, “It may seem hard to share personal feelings with parents, especially if you haven’t done it in a while. It also can be hard to share when you’re not really sure what’s going on yourself. Sometimes parents can offer a new angle that helps you figure things out. Just talking about it might help you see things more clearly for yourself. Some people worry about how a parent might react. Will mom be mad? Will dad be disappointed? It’s natural to worry, but most parents are supportive and understanding when they realize what’s going on. If you’re like most people, you probably wish your parent would start the conversation. Sometimes a parent will ask what’s wrong. Much of the time, though, it’s up to you. Find a time when you can approach your mom or dad in a calm way. You might want to open the conversation by asking, “Can I talk to you? I’ve been feeling depressed and bad about things. I’ve been thinking I might need to talk to someone.” If it’s too hard to start a conversation in person, you could write your parent a note saying you need to talk. Sometimes the conversation just gets started by itself. For example, if you’re crying or overwhelmed, you might just blurt out your feelings. This could be the perfect beginning to the conversation you need to have. If you’re really upset, you’ll need to calm yourself (at least a little) to make the conversation worthwhile. That way, a parent can hear what’s on your mind and really listen.”I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Two weeks ago I had this dream: I woke up in a trailer, went out and yelled at my boyfriend’s friend in the yard (they were being loud). I saw John Cena, followed him, and came to a huge nest of killer bees; he was riding a four-wheeler and was making the bees mad. The bees landed on me then after a while flew away and I ran into the woods. I was climbing on the trees like a monkey; I was naked with only a long shawl covering me. Snakes were crawling all over me and rubbing me sexually. I saw Medusa and made a deal with her; if I could control the snakes I would do her a favor. I ran out of the woods (still partially naked) fast like a vampire. My friend J ran up beside me (also naked) and ran with me. My boyfriend’s mom and sister saw me and followed me. Ended up back at the trailer; saw my boyfriend. He told me we couldn’t be together (J sent his mom pictures of me drunk). I said I was going to kill myself; boyfriend picked up rock, threw at killer bee nest. I asked “you want me to die?” whispered to the bees to come here (I could control them) went to J, and a demon baby ripped its way out of his stomach; 20 toddlers crawled out, stood up, and followed me. J was dead. I told boyfriend I was leaving to give Medusa the children and I was leaving with my child and touched my stomach. [/INST]  I know there are lots of books on the market that supposedly tell you how to interpret dreams. But the thing is that dreams are highly specific to the dreamer. What means something to you may well not mean the same thing to others. For that reason, such books are entertaining but not all that useful.Dreams are essentially your thoughts in pictures. The thoughts haven’t been made into language and so are symbolic. If you can’t figure out your symbols, it’s possible that a therapist can help you do so. Without knowing you, all I can get is that you’re very anxious about something – probably about something to do with relationships and maybe sex. (Or maybe you are just afraid of snakes and bees.)The fact that you’ve been thinking about this for two weeks suggests that you are trying to tell yourself something. Rather than trying to figure out the dream, it might be more productive for you to think about whether anything is particularly bothering you and, if so, to deal with it as best you can. In the dream, you are pretty resourceful. I bet you’re the same way when you’re awake.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My boyfriend and I have been together for a little under 4 years. When we first started the relationship I tried to be upfront and honest that I struggled with emotional connection and affection. I cared for him so much that I decided to see a therapist to remedy some issues that I had locked away for years. Needless to say after I opened the flood gate memories came rushing back. [/INST]  What a complicated time you’ve both had. Just when it looks like the emotional issues are getting resolved, you have a new medical problem. I suggest you take your boyfriend with you to see your doctor and have the doctor explain your diagnosis and prognosis. Fibroids and endometriosis are often treatable. Even if they are not in your case, communication and experimentation is the key to finding a way to have sex that is satisfying to you both. Educate yourselves by searching websites about the disease. Try out the suggestions in the spirit of adventure and exploration. Focus on intimacy and tenderness, not on rambunctious sex, as a way to deepen your understanding of each other. When two people love and cherish each other, there is always a way to give and receive sexual pleasure.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I recently moved to Philadelphia to be with my girlfriend after we have had a long distance relationship for 5 years. I have always had an issue saying no to my mother being somewhat of emotional support system for her since my father died when I was 12. I feel that my mother has some passive aggressive tendencies to get the things she wants from me. I also feel a level of guilt if I don’t give into her requests since I have been doing that for the greater part of my life. It has affected my girlfriend in that she doesn’t think I can put her before my mother. It feels like my mother is trying to manipulate our relationship so that I will return to her, and she can resume the early childhood mother role prior to me seeking my independence from her. I have also relied on my mother to tell me what to do for a majority of my life and now that I am away from her and with my girlfriend I look for her to do the same. I want to know what has caused me to be like this in my adult life. Thanks. [/INST]  I think you already answered your question about what caused you to develop these patterns. So I will answer a question you didn’t ask — which is how to make change. You are now 26. You’ve spent more than half your life trying to be supportive of your mom. It’s long past time for both you and your mother to shift your relationship from mother-son to adult-adult. Have a loving talk with your mom. Reassure her that you love her and will always be there should she really need you. But you need to turn your primary attention to your girlfriend or you will lose her.If your mother was happy with her marriage to your father, she will understand that you want no less for your own life. If she was in an unhappy marriage, I hope she will want a better relationship for you. Either way, ask for her blessing and move toward making your own decisions and making your life with your girlfriend your priority.If you find this too hard to do, you may want to find a therapist who can help you — and maybe your mother — through the process. You really can have your girlfriend and your mother too. Things just have to shift in a few important ways.I wish you well.  </s>"

"<s>[INST] My mom always makes fun of me when she’s mad. When she gets mad she starts making fun of my face and says I have such ugly acne and I’m overweight and nobody likes ugly tall girls. Every time I misbehave like any other teenager would, she would forcefully make me apologize to her and my dad and if I don’t they would just stop talking to me and eventually I’ll end up apologizing at the most smallest things. And every time my two sisters would misbehave my parents would just forgive them. I ALWAYS have to apologize when I do something wrong and they don’t. [/INST] This is a very, very sad situation. You are missing out on the love and care that every child deserves. Your parents are missing out on knowing their sensitive and thoughtful daughter. A wedge has been driven between you and your sisters. Everyone loses. What you are describing is emotional abuse. Like every child, you want your parents to love and protect you so you keep trying in spite of the way they treat you. But it has worn you down. A part of you is accepting your parents’ judgment that you aren’t worth taking care of. Sadly, you are now treating yourself the way they treat you.It’s time for a healthy rebellion. A healthy rebel decides for herself how to live a healthy and meaningful life. A healthy rebel uses anger and frustration as fuel to get out of a toxic situation. A healthy rebel decides that Mom and Dad are just plain wrong and sets out to prove it by living as excellent a life as she can.You’re 17. With some hard work, you can probably qualify for scholarships and get yourself out of the house and into a college next year. Talk with your school guidance people about how to identify schools you can get into and afford and how to get financial help. If school isn’t your thing, see if maybe you’d like to do a “gap year” (See the article on PsychCentral called “Are You Ready for College? Alternatives for the Unsure” ). The point is to get out of the house and into some new experiences that will introduce you to new people and lift your self-esteem.Meanwhile, love yourself enough to start working out again and start using your acne medicine. You’ll feel better. Take part in extracurricular activities and get a part-time job. Doing these things will build your resume and will give you some money to save for school or whatever other option you choose. Most important, activities and a job will keep you out of the house and away from the criticism. With a lot of effort and a little luck, you will also find some friends to hang out with. Positive support from friends can be a powerful antidote to what you’re going through at home.You may at some point want to find a therapist to help you if you can’t shake the negative messages you’ve been getting for so long. I’m sorry you don’t think your school counselors are trustworthy. See if there is a women’s center associated with the college in your town. If so, they may have free counseling. Another option is to call the hotline at Boys Town (1 800 448 3000). Counselors are available 24/7 to talk to kids who are having parent problems, depression, school problems or abuse. The service is free and confidential.I’m very, very glad you wrote. That may be the first sign of the healthy rebel in you.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: I have two irrational subconscious ideas that I need to solve. The first one is I think that people are always watching me. My brain tells me they hide cameras or do something so they see me and what I am doing all the time. I mostly think and worry about people I know doing this. My mind tells me they are doing this all the time. [/INST]  It’s not at all unusual for teens to worry excessively about what others think of them. It is not unusual for teens to be self-conscious in social situations or to be shy. It is unusual to think that others are reading your mind. I can’t tell from a letter whether you are a normal kid overthinking your shyness or if you may perhaps be struggling with something like obsessive compulsive disorder. (It’s unlikely that this is psychotic thinking because you do realize that your thoughts about other people reading your mind are irrational.) Whatever the cause, the thoughts are getting in your way and are causing you to suffer much too much.For that reason, I strongly urge you to make an appointment with a mental health counselor. A counselor can hear your whole story and can work with you to sort out whether you simply need some reassurance or if you need some treatment. Bring your letter and this response with you to your first appointment. It will help jumpstart the session.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve been cutting myself for a while now. Usually the cuts are small and the bleeding stops after 2 minutes. But today I cut until I saw white flesh. The bleeding was more severe, and lasted 4-5 minutes. My problem is that I don’t know when I should see a doctor for my scars? And my other problem is that my father is a doctor, and I’m so scared that he will find out if I have been to the ER. I know that the doctors don’t have the right to tell him, but I live in a small town, so I’m sure that he will find out if i have been to the ER. I try to take care of my scars, but know I am not sure if I can…. Please help me. [/INST]  The fact that you are cutting, and the cuts are becoming more severe, is concerning. You shouldn’t be trying to hide the scars but rather attempting to receive help by reporting these incidents to both your therapist and your parents. Cutting is dangerous and indicative of being in extreme emotional pain.I’m wondering if your therapist is aware of the full extent of your cutting behavior. My sense of the situation is that you have been less than forthcoming about the nature of your cutting and it could explain why your therapy isn’t working. Your therapist can’t properly help you if you withhold important information. Your therapist needs to know the full truth.You need to be honest. Be detailed about how much you cut, how deep and how often. You should also be honest about your opinion regarding your treatment, that you don’t think it is working. Without your feedback, neither your therapist nor your prescribing physician are fully aware of your condition and can’t adjust your treatments accordingly.Another idea is to keep a journal to document your feelings. Pay close attention to the thoughts or situations that precede your urge to cut. It could shed light on the underlying problem and help to uncover what is motivating your self-injurious behavior.Finally, go to the emergency room when necessary. Do it even if it means that your parents will find out. Your safety is of the utmost importance and I can assure you that your parents would agree. Please take care. </s>"

I’m basically sitting here, accepting failure and it’s not worrying me as much as it should. I’ve been feeling drastically lazy. Pretty much I just sit and watch TV and just spend my time very unproductively and don’t want to be this way. I’m not depressed; it’s just my mind and body won’t allow me to do things that I should be doing. If you suggest anything, please let me know. Thank you. [/INST]  You are motivated enough to ask the question. That’s a very good place to start. Let’s build on that.You are in your freshman year. My first question to you is whether you really want to be in college. Many teens go off to school because it is expected or because they don’t know what else to do. They are not there because they are passionate about a subject or excited about entering the professional world. The sudden lack of structure from the scheduled days of high school to the very unscheduled life of a college student isn’t necessarily freeing. Some students don’t yet have the internal structures necessary to schedule themselves. So they end up doing what you are doing: Not getting to class and not doing much. You might find this article helpful.If you recognize yourself in that article, I suggest you take a break from college. Do a gap year program or get out there and work until you figure out what you want to do in life. College is too expensive in time and money to just hang out there. Here are some suggestions for other ways to have new experiences and to grow.On the other hand: If you are really, really excited about school but just can’t get yourself up and out every day, there may be something else going on. If that’s the case, please make an appointment with your doctor for a complete medical check. If your body isn’t healthy, your mind won’t work as it should either. Sleep disorders can kill motivation and sap us of energy. Make sure you are getting eight hours of sleep regularly. Make sure you are eating right and getting a workout at least three days a week.If that all checks out and you are still feeling stuck, you might want to look into what mental health services are available at your school. You don’t have to have a diagnosable psychiatric problem to benefit from some counseling. Sometimes a counselor can provide support and advice while you figure things out for yourself.Please give yourself credit for recognizing that something is wrong and doing something about it. By acting now, you saved yourself years of feeling bad about yourself.I wish you well.  </s>"

Because you are drawn to people from a wide age range and you have elected to be in a relationship with someone of a similar age, it may have to do with a character trait or personality feature that transcends age.Of course, the obvious element therapeutically would be to use a form of psychodynamic therapy to find out if there had been unmet needs by your father or older brothers that you may be trying to meet through the attraction.

"<s>[INST] Hi I am a 21-year-old male student. Recently I smoked weed for second time in my life. I smoked more than what I smoked during my first time. I inhaled the smoked fully 6 times and then I started experiencing auditory hallucination like hearing people laugh when no one was there. Then I also heard song playing which was actually not playing. It got over after 2-3 hours. But now I am really scared that I might get schizophrenia in future. Because I have a family history of schizophrenia but not my parents and siblings but my cousin and his father. I got this fear because I read on internet that only those people predisposed to schizophrenia will experience these symptoms after smoking weed. And the weed was not mixed other substances. And I did not have any psychotic symptoms before that. Please response. [/INST] The research on whether or not cannabis causes schizophrenia is mixed. Scientists debate about causality. Generally speaking, individuals who use marijuana have a greater risk of having psychotic episodes than individuals who do not smoke marijuana. Psychosis involves a break with reality. Having a psychotic episode does not necessarily mean that an individual will develop schizophrenia, but it significantly increases the chances.Some research also indicates that each psychotic break damages the brain. That may be why it can take more medication to stabilize an individual after each psychotic break. You want to do everything in your power to avoid having psychotic breaks. That means not using drugs.The added concern about marijuana is its high potency levels. There’s a difference between the old and new cannabis. Levels of THC are much higher in the marijuana that’s available today than in years past. The higher the potency, the greater the potential for damage and detrimental outcomes.In addition to high potency levels, street drugs are dangerous, in part, because there are no checks and balances on ingredients. For instance, in an effort to expand their supply, dealers might add dangerous and toxic cutting agents such as rat poison, detergent, fentanyl, and so forth. With street drugs, there is no quality control. You simply don’t know what you’re getting.It’s safer not to use marijuana, especially given your family history. Having a family history of schizophrenia increases the probability of developing schizophrenia among offspring but it does not guarantee the development of the disorder.Schizophrenia is a complex disorder that is not well understood. Genetics are a factor and so is environment and other social and neurobiological considerations. Some research has indicated that if your parent has a serious mental illness, the risk of developing a serious mental illness among offspring is about one in 10. Newer research has indicated that the chances of developing serious mental illness among offspring is as much as one in three or one in two, of developing any mental disorder. Thus, if the disorder runs in your family, it’s important to be especially protective of your mental health. Therefore, you should strongly reconsider your use of illicit drugs.You had a negative experience and you seemed to recover. As you said, it only lasted two or three hours. You are fortunate. I have received letters from individuals who have used marijuana and who did not recover as quickly as you did. Some had symptoms that remained with them in the form of anxiety, depersonalization and derealization. Thankfully that didn’t happen to you.This may seem rather obvious but it needs to be said: you should stop using marijuana. Make that your last time. It would be wise to quit while you are ahead. The more you use it, the greater the risk of brain damage. It’s dangerous to use illicit drugs, of any kind. Stay safe and please take care. </s>"

Its beginning to become frustrating for me cause that kind of commitment out of him in my eyes would help my issues, we spend a lot of time together when we can, we still live apart, we have two dogs together. Now he’s talking about plans to move out in the Spring of 2014 but I cannot get past the past, he wants to go camping alone to go fish cause I work and I automatically start to cry, there’s another girl, he’s doing this to get a reaction out of me. I don’t know how to trust his words due to the stuff I’ve dealt with in the past with him. Its killing me I over eat I stress I look like I haven’t slept in weeks All I want is to smile again and believe it when he tells me he wants to be with me forever but with stupid comments and stupid actions its hard for me to believe. [/INST]  “We’re never so vulnerable than when we trust someone – but paradoxically, if we cannot trust, neither can we find love or joy.” — Walter AndersonIt seems to me there simply isn’t enough trust left in the relationship. You have been hurt and lied to and the engagement ring seems more like a tool for manipulation than a loving gesture. From what you have said he has lied, there is another girl, he is trying to do things to provoke you and he taunts you with an engagement ring – but doesn’t offer it.

"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: My girlfriend gets really really upset when I don’t share every detail of my life with her exactly when it is happening. I have been seeing my girlfriend for about 2 years now. She lives in Chicago and I live in the central part of Illinois. Its about a 3 hour drive. Our relationship revolves around communicating through our phones and sometimes we skype when we find time in our busy busy lives. I am back in school trying to finish up my degree, and it takes up a huge part of my time. Between studying and class and homework, I am usually bogged down with that on top of my obligations to life and her. [/INST]  From your description, I’d say that your girlfriend is terribly insecure. It’s unreasonable to expect you to maintain a running commentary on your every move. You are working hard and juggling a great deal. If she loves you and trusts you, she should be more supportive and understanding. She certainly shouldn’t be bashing you and cursing you. And you shouldn’t be putting up with that kind of behavior.Did something happen to your girlfriend in the past that makes her so distrustful? Perhaps that’s the conversation you should be having with her. If so, her behavior is more understandable but that doesn’t make it acceptable. If she tries to protect herself by controlling you, she is going to create the very thing she fears. For your own peace of mind, you will have to leave her despite all her good qualities.Try having a direct conversation with her. Make it clear that you will not accept the terms that she is setting for your relationship. Reassure her of your love. Remind her that you have done nothing to deserve distrust. And make it clear that you will not stay in a relationship where you are distrusted and verbally abused. Then see where it goes. If she can’t let up on micromanaging your life, please think hard about whether this is the relationship for you.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m wondering if anything is “wrong” with me. I don’t feel like there’s anything wrong with me. In fact, I feel pretty good. But…I really want to kill people, and I guess I think I probably shouldn’t. I have found some similar questions, but nothing that really answers my question. The main difference is that I don’t think I would really care on an emotional level if I killed anyone. The thought of actually going through with it doesn’t scare or distress me; quite the opposite, actually. I think it would be a lot of fun. The reason I think I shouldn’t is that I believe I would be more successful (whatever that means…) if I didn’t. Jail seems like a really boring place to be. I’ve felt bored for as long as I can remember. I like learning, or at least the idea of it, because I think having more information is good. Even learning is boring, though. I think it would be nice if it weren’t. Since I dislike being bored, and I imagine that jail would probably be even more boring that my life currently is, I’d rather not go to jail. There aren’t a lot of ways to research “killing without getting caught” so I figured I’d try to figure out how to not kill people instead. I’ve never actually killed anyone, if that matters. I’ve killed animals, and it was pretty nice, but never humans. I can’t quite describe why I want to kill. When I think about it, I feel like have a reason to live. I’ve never been suicidal, but I also feel detached, as if I am living my life just because I have nothing better to do. When I think about killing, that changes. I feel glad to be alive and I can’t wait act on the feelings. But I think I shouldn’t, and that’s why I’m submitting this question. So, how do I stop wanting to kill people? And is there something else that could make me feel the same way? I really like the feeling, and there isn’t much else that I like, so I don’t want to lose it. (age 19, from the US) [/INST]  Yes, I believe that it’s safe to say that something is “wrong” with you. Never once did you mention that killing people might be morally wrong, or that it would hurt an innocent person, or that the person might not deserve to die, or that the person’s loved ones might be affected, etc. It appears that you have no empathy and that you are only looking for an answer to your boredom. I find this very concerning. It’s also concerning that you have enjoyed killing animals. Many of the things you are describing can be related to very serious psychological problems, such as Antisocial Personality Disorder or Sociopathy.The fact that it would take something this extreme for you to “feel” is a sign that something is wrong. The fact that you think you would get enjoyment out of killing another person is wrong. Please get help soon so that not only will an innocent person or animal not have to die, but you can avoid spending the rest of your life in prison.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST]  I have a question and really looking for an answer from an expert. Since 4 years I happened to watch some video over the internet about humiliation and slavery, I didn’t like it at the first place, but it grew in me. [/INST]  What you are describing is a sexual fetish. Sadomasochism or BDSM has long been studied by psychology. Both Freud and Jung have elaborate theories to explain this sexual fetish. Most theorists since then also have had their theories of this sexual fetish. Generally, we need to assess the effect of the fetish on the life of the individual. In other words, is the sexual fetish causing problems in the life of the individual? In your case, you are experiencing guilt and this is a problem.Many people include this particular sexual fetish in their normal sexual lifestyle and it has no negative effect upon the rest of their lives. Your fiancé may share your interest but you will not know this if you do not talk with her about it. From your letter, it appears to me that you may be ashamed of your fantasies and thus would not want to reveal them to your fiancé. Many people have sadomasochistic fantasies and many of them incorporate these fantasies into their sex life.If your fiancé had these fantasies and you did not, would you think less of her? If you think that these fantasies are bad and unacceptable, then it creates a dilemma because you are enjoying viewing them on the Internet.A therapist could help you to stop viewing these materials or they could help to remove the guilt that you feel after viewing the materials. I can tell you that your sexual interest in this fetish is fairly commonly found in the world’s population. I cannot tell you that you should accept these feelings as normal, if you find them to be unacceptable. If you feel that your fantasies are inappropriate, then through your own efforts or with the help of a therapist, you should stop viewing this fetish on the Internet.I would highly recommend that you discuss this with a therapist. I wish you the best of luck. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am writing you because I recently received some sessions at a local community therapy clinic and I don’t feel like we accomplished anything there. I am constantly thinking about suicide, or (I’m ashamed to say) faking a suicide so that I can get help. I was fired from my job about 2 months ago and haven’t been able to get another one. I recently started college and I am having to appeal a financial aid denial due to missing dropping the one class I registered for when I was 17. I have no family to look to for financial support and my situation gets more and more desperate every day. [/INST]  It is good that you have begun your therapy at your community mental health agency but you think it may not be helping. Talk to your therapist and be honest about the fact that you feel your work together is not effective. In many clinics, it is relatively common for clients to try several therapists before they find a suitable match.In addition to individual therapy, you should also consider group therapy. Some individuals prefer group therapy over individual therapy. There are several advantages of group therapy, including: increased support, increased feedback, increased interactional opportunities, and the chance to practice and to develop social skills. The more people that you can make a positive connection with, the better you will feel. Group therapy is also generally less expensive when compared to individual therapy.You may also want to investigate the counseling services offered by your college. Most colleges provide their students with short-term, professional mental health care free of charge.If you were to get a job or were granted the necessary financial aid to continue college, I believe that your mindset would change. It is important to keep your situation in perspective. It is a difficult time in your life but that can change. There are many ups and downs in life. That is true for everyone.Your lack of social support is also contributing to the problem. If you had more support from friends or from family, then you would be less likely to consider suicide. That is one reason why it is imperative for you to stay connected to a mental health agency, and you can do this by joining a support group or by finding a different therapist.Individuals who are considering suicide often view their life situation through a prism of hopelessness. Their difficult situation is temporary but they don’t see it that way. They have difficulty envisioning an end to their suffering. Understandably they want their pain to end. Getting help is the answer, not suicide.I would recommend that you read this article about individuals who attempted suicide and survived. One of the most important messages of the article is that the individuals who attempted suicide and survived were thankful to have lived. In the depths of depression, they incorrectly predicted that their lives would never improve. They were fortunate enough to live to see their lives improve.Don’t stop trying to get help. Try other therapists. Investigate other types of treatment such as group therapy or psychiatric medication. Remember that even though your life is difficult now it can change. Call 911 or go to the emergency room if you feel that you cannot keep yourself safe. I wish you the best. Take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I thought for many years that I lack emotion and as I get older I have come to realize that this is true and has been present since childhood; pictures that I have taken I noticed that I never smiled. I have been trying very hard to fit in and express the correct emotion by studying others in a given situation. I suffer from social anxiety and isolating myself doesn’t improve my situation. Despite this I am a union representative at work and I am an excellent student in college; although I would prefer to be a missionary but I know I have a bad habit of doing what is expected. [/INST]  Gently and soon. I do understand what you were trying to do. I do applaud you for taking some risks. But this man deserves to have someone in his life who loves him wholeheartedly, not someone who is in the relationship primarily to struggle with her own issues. Follow your good instincts. Thank him for his love and attention. Tell him some of what you have told me to make it clear to him that it isn’t about him but rather that it is about your own unresolved problems. Let him know that you wish it were different and that he is a fine and good person in your eyes. Free him to find someone who can reciprocate his love.Then get some therapy. Your impulse to make change is a good one! Anxiety is treatable. There are better ways to handle it than living this double life. Furthermore, there are reasons you feel so disconnected from others – and from yourself. Therapy will help you understand yourself better and will help you develop a more honest approach to life. You deserve to be able to look in the mirror each day and feel that you are a person with integrity. It’s lonely in that shell of yours. I think you also deserve to have help developing into the kind of genuine person you want to be. I searched the web for mental health services in your city. There are several centers that offer the full range of psychiatric and counseling services. Please ask your doctor or someone you trust for a recommendation.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I need to make a decision: My husband is depressed. I have tried to help him but he has been unwilling to help himself, although he talks about it. I am considering divorce because living with him has become very difficult for me. I’m very unhappy in our relationship, as I suspect he is also. [/INST]  You are asking a far too complicated question for me to answer responsibly. What I can offer is some thoughts for you to consider: You are in your 60s. You are considering two very significant changes in your life that will have impact on both you and your husband.Before going ahead with either the surgery or the separation, I urge you to find an experienced therapist who works regularly with older clients and talk this through. You need input and support from a professional — especially since your husband is depressed.Therapy is not limited to relieving mental illness. Often we therapists serve as an objective sounding board for decision-making. Often we provide support and guidance for personal growth.As a senior myself, I’ve come to appreciate that it is sometimes more helpful to talk with an age-mate who understands issues around aging (and the life decisions that come with it) from a personal as well as a professional point of view. As actress Bette Davis once said, “Getting older is not for sissies.” Life decisions are more momentous because there is less time to make changes and less time to back away from those changes if we make a mistake.The decisions you are making are very, very important ones. Please don’t be impulsive about them. Don’t let other people pressure you into making them before you have given them the time, respect and consideration they deserve.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Lebanon: It has been a long period that I’ve been worried, asking constant questions to myself. First of all, I am a gay guy, at the age of 21. My life was a continuous fear of expression and exposure of my true self to the world. Ever since I knew I was gay at the age of 7 or 8, I started having irrational fears and extreme anger/irritation that dragged into all of my early adolescence. I had an extreme hate towards myself, sabotaging every artistic talent that I had, from a writing skill, a drawing skill, a beautiful voice, basically every aspect of my talent that was feminine, I hated it. I was always afraid of being judged, [/INST]  Sadly, your story is very much like the stories of many of my gay clients who grew up in a homophobic family and/or unaccepting (even hostile) community. I know it won’t fix everything but it might help you feel a bit better to understand that you are not at all alone in your struggles. Ironically, your fear, your distancing from others, and your self-sabotaging may have helped you survive through your teen years. It’s possible that you were protecting yourself by making yourself invisible and non-threatening. Unfortunately, those behaviors may have become habits that are now in your way.But now you are 21. You are in college. I hope there are parts of your life where it is safe to claim your sexual identity and to start being your real self. It will be difficult. It’s not like you can flip a switch from being a scared kid in hiding to being a confident adult. But over time you can do it. With some professional help and support, you could do it more easily.Unfortunately, I don’t know what resources are available in your country. You would benefit from some therapy and an LGBT support group. If that isn’t possible, a place to start is the forum for sexuality issues here at PsychCentral. I also did a little research and found that there are a number of online support groups where you can get both pracical advice and empathetic support from other gay men worldwide. I hope you will explore gaining more self-knowledge through the self-expression your art can provide for you.I think writing to us here at PsychCentral was one of the many ways that you are coming out and coming into your self. It’s a good start. But it’s only a start. I hope you will continue to look for ways to get help and healing. You deserve it.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Bangladesh: I am 34, married, have a daughter who is eight years old. I love her a lot. [/INST]  Your unresolved anger at past abuse is keeping you stuck. You say you want to live away from your parents, but if you live away from your parents you will have to support yourself. If you get on with life and support yourself, you may believe that you are helping your parents deny responsibility for past abuse. You may be giving your parents pain but at great expense to yourself.I agree: You need therapy. At some point, we all need to learn ways to move on from our upbringing and create our own adult life. Your self-esteem would be better served by finding a good job and getting on with the responsibilities and tasks of adulthood instead of entertaining philosophical questions about whether you need to compensate for the last 10 years of procrastination.The first step you need to take is to find a therapist and get to work on focusing on your future instead of your past. Since you admit that you procrastinate, I doubt you can move on without help. Please get the support and practical help a therapist can provide. You deserve to be all you can be. Your partner deserves to have a functioning partner. Your little girl needs a dad who is able to show her how to be an independent, working adult.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a 15 year old in Indonesia: Good day! I would like to describe my condition. For as long as I could remember, I just like the idea of self-harm and even harming others, also the sight of blood flowing out. I just feel as though I genuinely enjoy it. No sexual satisfaction in it whatsoever, I just find it interesting and more often calming. Whenever I see blood, wound, scratches, bruises (on myself or other people)– I feel enraptured by such sight. [/INST]  “Toublesome”? Yes! — Self-harm is an expression of emotional distress.Think of it as being symbolic. You hurt inside but can’t stand it and don’t know how to deal with it.. You are diverting yourself from your feelings by focusing on hurting yourself or others.You are not at all alone in this. Self-harm happens most often in teens because there are new and powerful feelings that happen during adolescence. Teens who don’t know how to cope sometimes start cutting as a way to deal with them. Unfortunately, self-harm doesn’t take care of the root cause of the feelings. All it does is distract from them. But since self-harm is the only way the person knows how to get away from the feelings, it generally leads to more self-harm.The first step is to start talking about your feelings to an adult you trust. You need to get them out instead of turning them in. Then you absolutely, absolutely must learn some coping skills. Emotional distress is often a fact of life. Sometimes it’s only a little. Sometimes it is a lot. But you can’t be human and avoid feeling powerful feelings every now and then. You need to learn how to manage those feelings in other ways.You may be able to work on this on your own by researching self-harm and what to do about it. But if you can’t (and most people can’t), you should seek out a therapist. Ask your doctor to refer you to someone who can help. Professionals won’t judge you. They want to help you.Please get help now — before the habit gets more entrenched. It will only get harder to deal with. Take care of yourself. You deserve to have a life that is rich in emotions without being overpowered by them.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been led to believe that I have borderline personality disorder and I would like to double check that. I have anxiety and led to have signs of anxiety. I tend to get angry if my parents come into my room and start talking to me. I like to be alone. I like to be different. When someone calls me normal I dislike it a lot. I seem to like being upset and when I’m not upset for a long period of time I stop taking medication to cause me to be upset. I self harm and I have been for 3 years. I often plot to kill myself, but never go through with it due to family being home. I have often stop and start eating randomly I could not eat for days then go on a huge binge at random. Nothing ever seems to be in between its always right or wrong. I have stolen items in the past even whilst having money with me which is a little strange. My parents divorced when I was 8 and I didn’t stop hearing about it. I still haven’t stopped hearing about it. I tend to lose interests in relationships fast, and I am clingy to the friends I have. [/INST]  I cannot give an official diagnosis over the Internet, and without doing an assessment, but you are certainly describing traits that are included in the criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder. However, most of us hesitate to truly diagnose personality disorders in adolescents because you are still developing your personality. Which is even more reason you should work on changing some of these extreme tendencies while you are young enough to do so. I hope you are working with a therapist, and if not, please consider finding one that you like.There are lots of ways to cope with feelings other than harming yourself and you need to learn that feeling “upset” should not be your preferred state. I’m sorry that you are still hearing about your parents’ divorce but even that is something that you can heal from and move beyond. On one hand, adolescence is a time when you can try on many different hats in discovering yourself, but it is also a time to begin thinking about your future and who you want to become.

"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: My boyfriend has no trust for me due to past relationships.

[/INST] I’m sorry this is so painful for you. But I do agree with your friends. This guy is too insecure and controlling. As you said, there is nothing you can do to “make” him trust you. A relationship with him means giving up more and more of yourself in order to prevent fights. Love doesn’t require walking on eggshells to keep things stable. Love doesn’t require a person to give up her other friends or to be constantly on the alert for his sensitivities.I worry that you are staying with him because he is the first guy you had sex with. You may be trying to convince yourself you love him in order to justify having had sex with someone who isn’t the guy for you. It may be difficult for you to let go, but he simply isn’t worth your love or your loyalty. Get out before you get even more hurt.

"<s>[INST] My sister is 33, married and has a 7, 4yr old and an 8th month-old recently diagnosed with a rare genetic condition. She has struggled with anger issue always but never acknowledges it. She always has dealt with stress or being mad at one person by shutting off and being angry with everyone. We as a family have just adapted to tip-toeing around her when she’s having a mood but has never addressed it properly by she will not talk about it and will stop speaking to you until you drop it. She is in a particularly bad episode at the moment and she is understandably stressed about her son’s condition and medical issues. She is angry at all of us and always pretty abrupt with the other children. Time has come to get her to acknowledge and cope with the way she deals with stress. She might need therapy but I don’t think shed even listen to this suggestion. How can we help her, giving her space but we don’t want her isolated ( she doesn’t have relationships outside the family), confronting her will push her farther away, talking to her won’t work she will just refuse to listen and we can’t keep ignoring it. (From Ireland) [/INST] I deeply appreciate the love and care you are trying to bring to your sister. Anger comes from a need that hasn’t been met and it sounds as if your sister may be feeling that many of her needs in life aren’t being met. If the anger isn’t the result of drug or alcohol abuse (as it often is) and she is resistant to therapy (which would be a good idea), then you are left with the option of helping her self-regulate her emotions.I have three recommendations. All three involve you being part of the process of engaging your sister in some healthy emotional habits. The first is for the two of you to take a meditation class together. They are everywhere and finding the most convenient one that has a decent reputation in the way to start.Secondly, particularly with anger issues, I’d highly recommend a yoga class as this is almost a direct way to begin the process of emotional self-regulation.Finally, if drugs or alcohol are involved, an offer to go with her to an Alcoholics Anonymous or AlAnon open meeting would be helpful. The culled wisdom of these groups for helping people regulate their emotions is tough to beat.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teenage girl in Phillippines: i am listing things that i experiences that i have trouble understanding. – i lie. i lie a lot and people believe me all the time, i always feel like the moment they knew me for who i am, they’ll leave me. sometimes i try to tell the truth and it always sounds like a lie. -i am currently in my senior year and my friends know me as a socially awkward person with claustrophobia. i don’t have claustrophobia but i enjoy the feeling of them taking extra care whenever we are at tight places. i am not socially awkward (i think so) because i have many friends and can befriend someone easily. -i tend to try to manipulate the people around me for no reason, i always ruin my relationships as soon as someone gets too close to me. -i once was sexually abused but my family said it’s not true and that all of it was just a dream. at night, i am troubled by those memories and am confused whether they are true or only a dream. -i want to be punished but not verbally. -my parents are on constant war and they hurt each other physically and sometimes i want them to die (this is wrong but i’m just telling the truth) -i get thoughts like wanting to hurt someone, torture and kill someone involuntarily, these thoughts grow stronger when i’m angry and i secretly start to think of the most painful way to kill someone, since i wont and cant do it, i hurt myself instead. -i have been wounding myself whenever i get urges to hurt someone. -i want to smoke so badly. i get urges to do a lot of wrong stuff and all day i would get these urges unless i give in to the craving, most of the time i just wound myself to stop the craving. -i always end up ruining things. -i want someone to know me for who i am but i don’t know how they’ll accept it. -i was bullied in my junior years and those memories sometimes comes back and i get panic attacks. -i cry at times for no reason. there is just too many thoughts in my mind that sometimes i get tired of it. -i want to die so badly, my family know i am wounding myself, they talk to me at times but i just dont know how to explain things to them. how can you explain something you dont understand? [/INST]  You have many, many reasons to be upset. Sexual abuse, bullying and warring parents can make a kid feel very unsafe and insecure. It’s no wonder to me that your feelings are all over the place. All of the behaviors you are worried about look to me like ways to you are trying to feel more in control when life feels unpredictable and even dangerous.Lying and manipulating people may be a way to try to have some control. So is hurting yourself. Wanting to hurt others may be yet another way that you are telling yourself that you are deeply hurt.The healthiest part of your letter is that you want to “fix” yourself.

I think you need to see a therapist who can help you sort out your feelings and who can support you as you deal with your complicated past (and present).Since you are in your senior year, you are at a transitional time of life. This is an excellent time to take charge of yourself and get the help you need. Find a therapist so you can work on getting ready to leave home and to establish a healthy adult life.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My sister has many symptoms of someone who suffers from borderline personality disorder — she feels lost, and doesn’t know what direction she needs to go in life. In the last six months, she has come up with different things she wants to be when she grows up (she’s in her forties). This has been a pattern in her life. She catastrophizes many events in her life — “this is the worst thing that could ever happen,” I’ve heard that from the car accident to remodeling the kitchen. She has cut off relationships at the drop of a hat, never to speak to people again. She gets angry very quickly and when slightly challenged or confronted, will cut you off quickly, either by hanging up on you or leaving. [/INST] A person has borderline personality disorder if they meet a certain number of clinical criteria including many of the symptoms that your sister displays. However, only a trained clinician who met with your sister in person would know for sure if she suffers with this disorder, and like you mentioned, it is unlikely that she would attend such an evaluation.Even if your sister would attend an evaluation and seek treatment, it may take a long time for her to change. Even the best treatments for borderline personality disorder can take months to years to help a person get a handle on their symptoms and alter their long-standing pattern of behavior. The bottom line is that even if she is successful at changing her behavior, it could take a long time for you to notice a marked improvement.Because of this my suggestion is that you will likely need to learn better ways to deal with your sister. This means that you will have to change your behavior towards her. For instance, you mentioned that she only seems to want you as a sounding board to which you provide for her at her request. This is a big mistake and is particularly unhealthy for you and an incorrect way to deal with her. It sounds like you have to “walk on eggshells” whenever she is around. You do this because you do not want to lose her but the problem is that you are essentially letting her abuse you or act inappropriately towards you. She in essence is getting away with acting a certain way towards you, in an abusive and inappropriate way because she can get away with it from you.It would be better for you to define when you are going to be there for her and it should not be when she demands that you be there. You can be there for her when you are available — on your time — and when she can learn to talk and treat with you with more respect and not make unreasonable demands, yell or scream or act out inappropriately. You should not have to “walk on eggshells” around your sister and the way to stop this is to better define how she can interact with you. If you do this successfully and in time, you will change the dynamic of your relationship with her. You will not cure her (if she has an illness such as borderline personality disorder) but you will have a better and potentially more stable relationship with your sister.Finally, let me warn you that if you begin to change the way you interact with your sister (i.e. you no longer be her sounding board whenever she demands) this will anger her at first. To be successful in permanently changing the way you interact with her, you will need to let her be angry with you. In time, her anger will decrease and she will ultimately learn this new way of dealing with you on your terms.I hope this helps answer your question or gives you at least a little insight on how to deal with difficult and unreasonable people. Please write back if you have any more questions or need clarification. Take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] adhd, adjustment disorder: Ive been stuggling with a few issues recently and I dont know whether or not to go to a therapist. Im worried about potential adjustment disorder and inattentive adhd. I just cant deal with change.When I first started university I was having a good time but when I got home I was miserable and didnt want to go back .Id just burst into tears at the thought of having new friends because I just wanted my old ones. Eventually I settled in. A weirder example is when I got a second cat, I kept trying to convince my parents to give her away because I liked the dynamic of having one cat,it meant no favourites and the thought of things changing made me cry just thinking about it. This anxiety if change has always followed me. When i was younger Id have frequent dreams of finding out my mam was pregnant and Id wake up crying. Now this feeling has returned because my parents want to move and I just cant cope with the idea. I love my house, its ours and the thought of someone else living here and making it their home just makes me burst into tears.Another recent example was I had my first brief relationship which I ended just before we got together because I just couldn’t deal with it. He asked me out and I cried the whole walk home after saying yes,I did the same thing(crying)after he kissed me in the car ride home with my dad. My parents keep telling me to stop getting so worked up about silly things but I just cant help it. [/INST]  I would not characterize these problems as being indicative of a mental illness, but rather life problems that are easily resolved with counseling. Generally speaking, these problems seem to be the result of immaturity, fear and lack of life experience. You seem to find your life as it is to be less frightening than it would be if it were to change. Yet change is the only way that life can get better. Fear of change, coupled with a lack of confidence in your ability to handle change, might be the root of these problems.Procrastination is a common problem. It is the act of delaying something longer than you should. It is not a mental illness. It’s possible that you lack the skills and self-control for completing your work in a timely manner. These time management skills can be learned.At the college level, professors have deadlines. When those deadlines are not met the result will be bad grades. Bad grades can hinder your ability to complete college and negatively affect your long-term career goals. To the outside world, a procrastinator is seen as irresponsible. You want to avoid being labeled as such.You said that you do follow through on certain tasks but not on others, such as school assignments. That is probably because you feel confident about some tasks but lack the confidence to perform well on school tasks and thus you avoid doing things that you are unsure of. This might be another example of how low self-confidence, fear and avoidance are negatively impacting your life.You have asked me about whether or not you should consult a therapist. Yes, you should. These are exactly the types of problems that a therapist would help you work on. There’s no good reason to continue to live with problems that are easily remedied. If you have a problem, get help from the people whose job it is to help people with problems.If you’re willing to participate in treatment and to do the work necessary, you should expect a good outcome. Imagine all that you can accomplish in life, when these stumbling blocks are removed. With good counseling that’s a very reasonable expectation. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  I have Stage 3 Cancer that is in remission now. I have gained back all the weight that I had lost during Interferon Therapy. I feel alone in my life. I don’t know what to do with myself. I still work but that is all there is. My wife and I get along but there is no emotional closeness between us. She goes out on the weekends with her girlfriends and I stay home. I have no close friends, I am over weight and lack confidence in myself. Nothing excites me, Nothing to look forward to. [/INST]  Everyone has to find a meaning for life. It is easy to live without purpose. What should you be doing, is not just a question for you but for everyone. Existentialists believe that depression comes from living inauthentically, which simply means that you are not living in a manner that is correct for your uniqueness. Children, when given the freedom to do so, automatically do those things that make them happy. When we force them to conform to our expectations, we take them away from their natural bliss.What made you happy before, perhaps long before, will make you happy again. I hope that it doesn’t sound too simple to say that you should get back to your roots. Your situation is complicated by your illness. You may be limited to some degree. You should discuss with your wife your feelings of loneliness but you should not be dependent upon her for your happiness. You should suggest to her that you two do more as a couple.I don’t know your feelings about religion or God but many people find that their relationship with God prohibits them from feeling alone. You can read about divinity in a general way without committing to the dogma of a particular religion.You may consider doing volunteer work or engaging yourself in helping others in some less structured way. Many people find great purpose and meaning through their acts of kindness toward others. You have asked me for suggestions and I can only be general in my response because I know very little about you. If you were my client, I could be much more specific and that leads me to suggesting professional counseling for you. A counselor would be able to probe your life and make many very relevant suggestions to you about changes that could bring happiness into your life.I wish you continued medical success and I hope you find the happiness that you truly deserve. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: First, I’m a survivor of a narcissistic parent. I’ve since recognized it, found a way to deal and stopped blaming myself. After over 10 years of marriage and 3 children, I’m now wondering if my husband is also a narcissist and emotionally abusing me because many things he does are just like what my parent did. [/INST] I don’t know if he is a narcissist. I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of only a letter. But I can share your concern that you have put up with these behaviors because you were so well trained to do so by your narcissistic father. If so, don’t be hard on yourself. We are all drawn to what is most familiar, even when the familiar isn’t what is good for us.Only you can decide if your husband’s positive qualities outweigh the many hurtful things he does and says. The behaviors you describe are not the behaviors of someone who loves and cherishes his wife. But it may be that he is highly anxious himself and tries to manage that anxiety by being as in control of a situation as he can be.It may be helpful for the two of you to go to couples counseling for a few sessions to sort that out and to address some of the patterns in your relationship that are so difficult for you.If he won’t go, please go yourself. I think you would find it helpful to talk through any confusions you have about whether he is hurtful or if you are over-reactive due to your history with your parents.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I had glasses, unruly hair, and a weird wardrobe when I was a child and was constantly made fun of because of it from age 7-12 yrs old. I never had any friends to defend me and the teachers didn’t care or notice. I was too embarrassed to tell my family because, in their eyes, being bullied was seen as being weak. [/INST]  I appreciate your resilience in finding a creative outlet for your energy and in doing so correcting for what happened in the past by being noticed positively for your talent. I do think therapy would be the right thing, and they have a suggestion about which type. I would highly recommend finding a psychodramatist or drama therapist in your area who may be able to help you use your dramatic skills for a corrective solution. They are both very familiar with the creative process as a reaction to family dynamics and will help you explore what needs to be done.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I was laying flat on my back, eyes closed, and all of a sudden as I’m trying to fall asleep, I start feeling heavier and heavier, like my body is suddenly gaining mass and pressing me into the mattress. I start shaking, and my heartbeat is going crazy. The next thing I know, I’m seeing things. Like, dreaming, but not. I can still feel my body, and I’m not all the way asleep, and I can kind of see shapes and impressions of things but it’s all made up of black. There’s no color to it. It all feels very real, and all of a sudden, as I’m trying to pick up a box in this not-dream, I can’t lift it. It isn’t that the box is heavy, it’s that my arms just won’t lift! I can just feel my heart going faster and faster, and my entire body is almost buzzing. I open my eyes, shaking, and my arms feel like they’ve been straining at something for hours. I have to roll over and curl up against the wall because my body is still freaking out. The entire thing lasted about half an hour. What the heck just happened to me?? All I know is that my arms and shoulders are still tensed an hour later (not like constantly, but I definitely feel like they’re still trying to tense all the time), and my heart is still not back to normal yet. [/INST]  What you are reporting may be sleep paralysis. This happens when the normal atonia that happens in REM stage sets in sooner than usual. Those who experience it report feeling as though they are being held down or that they have become solid and heavy. Often other sensory phenomena occur at the same time. Do a little research and see if the information validates your experience.However — If you believe you may have had a seizure, you should be contacting your doctor immediately, especially if this has happened before. The Internet can be a useful source of information, but it is not a substitute for medical help when something is a serious concern.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Cyprus: I am a 17 year old boy currently studying for my University exams. My lessons are being affected by my mum (51) who is having Psychological disorders. She used to be a very calm person and used to spoil me as a kid but now she is acting very strangely. She can insult people very harshly, especially plummers and sellers swearing to them when something is wrong and she can go mad at anyone for the smallest thing. My grandma asked her to stay and help her and when she came home she threw the chairs wildly into the air, she said to me I am a complete useless boy when I only asked her if I could go out. She even forgot about that later on and acted as if nothing happened (this is continuously occurring). [/INST]  Your mother is lucky indeed to have such a caring son. Instead of just rejecting her, you wrote to us to try to find some answers. At some point, she’ll recover and appreciate your loving efforts.I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of a short letter. But I can make a few suggestions:First, and most worrisome, is your sister. She is dangerously underweight and may be suffering from anorexia. You mother may feel so helpless and scared that it is driving her crazy. I hope your family is seeking treatment for your sister. She needs it. Your family needs help to understand how best to help her.Secondly, your mom moved from a place where she probably had supportive friends and an active life. She may be unable to cope with the change. You didn’t tell me why you all moved or if she took part in the decision. If she didn’t want to move and now feels isolated and angry, she may be depressed. Some people show depression by being irritable and angry as well as sad. Then again, over-cleaning, using make-up and over-reacting may be signs of the hypomanic stage of bipolar disorder.And, she may be peri-menopausal which can be very challenging for some women.Those are only guesses. You need to get her to some qualified doctors to see which, if any, is correct. I hope your father is willing to help you persuade her that she isn’t herself these days. Emphasize your love and caring and ask her to do you all the favor of taking care of herself by getting evaluated and accepting some help.Do get her to see her physician. She needs a complete medical work up to make sure that her hormones are in balance and that there isn’t anything else, like a vitamin deficiency, that could be amiss. At the same time, I would encourage her to see a counselor for two reasons: First to learn some ways to help her daughter and, secondly, to talk about how to start a new life in a new home. Finally, I would get her evaluated by a qualified mental health provider to make sure that she isn’t developing a mental illness.I wish you all well,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the UK: My girlfriend and I were on holiday, toward the end of the holiday i realised my girlfriend had been acting quite suspicious with her phone by hiding notifications whenever they came up and i was considering confronting her but decided to let it slide and just try to get over it. [/INST] Trust is a very fragile thing. Once broken, it is very difficult to regain. I have no way of knowing if your girlfriend is being honest about the nature of her relationship with the guy at work. But I do know that the two of you had an understanding about what it means to be faithful and she broke it without talking to you about wanting to renegotiate it. She may be telling the truth that she just wanted to avoid an argument with you. Maybe not.One of the most important tasks of the teen years is learning how to be in a trusting and loving relationship. At the very least, your girlfriend needs to learn how to approach difficult subjects with the person she loves and not be so afraid of an argument that she hides. You need to learn how to confront a problem directly instead of playing detective.If we could rewind the tape of life: You would have pressed her for an explanation of her secretive behavior and she would have shared her text messages with you. If those messages were harmless, trust wouldn’t have become an issue and your relationship would have been brought to a deeper level by working through the “rules” of your partnership.If the two of you can have a deep and honest conversation about how to be trusting and trustworthy, you may be able to salvage this relationship. If the two of you can’t talk this through to the point where you are both comfortable, then it may be best to learn what you can from the experience and to move on.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My cousin is 16. She drinks, does drugs and has sex. she failed math this year and has gone to school and taken tests high. Recently she started going to church and promised to stop this destructive behavior, but she has not. She has a loving family, but she doesn’t seem to connect to them very well, and they fight a lot. Her older brother acted in much the same way, he ended up with a child and spending some time in jail before he died in an accident a few years ago at the age of 21. I am so worried about her. She knows what the consequences of these behaviors could be, but she doesn’t seem to care. She is letting the boys she hooks up with treat her like trash, and i know she has taken at least weed, speed and cough syrup. is there anything I can say that will get through to her? [/INST]  It is difficult to watch someone you care about suffer. As you mentioned, you have attempted to make your cousin aware of the consequences of her dangerous behavior yet it has not stopped her. She most likely does not fully realize that her behavior is destructive.I would encourage you to continue to voice your concerns to your cousin. You may also want to discuss this matter with your parents or hers. Perhaps one of your parents would be willing to call her parents. If you chose to speak with her parents, you do not have to “tell on her.” You could alert her family about your concerns without being specific about her behavior.Another idea is to speak to a faculty member (guidance counselor, etc.) at the school about your concerns. In most areas, school is not in session at this time but it will be in the very near future.You may also want to consider approaching her accompanied by other individuals who share your concerns. Approaching with a group of individuals who all share the same opinions might help to further strengthen your case.The bottom line is that you can’t control someone else’s behavior. You can and should continue to state your concerns but realize that there is a limit as to how much you can affect someone else’s behavior. That is the unfortunate reality. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I can’t function when this happens. I recently failed out of college, and ever since, I am not sure I am okay. I keep “checking out”, as in I suddenly will lose my ability to focus on anything, my brain gets very foggy/tired, and I will lose a lot of muscle tension and not be able to hold anything or stand up very straight. A couple nights ago, I was crying very hard and in a lot of pain, when I heard Hound speak up. (Hound is an internal voice in my head. He started as an imaginary friend and just took on a life of his own. I don’t mind him; he never threatens me, makes demands of me, etc.) He said “Shhhh. You’re okay. I’m going to take care of it.” and I “checked out” into that foggy state; I stopped feeling anything and went limp. This isn’t the first time Hound has told me that he is the reason behind my dissociation (if that’s the right word). [/INST]  You did not detail what led to your problems at school. I suspect that your failing at school and your latest symptoms might be related. Both are signs of a potential problem. To address your question directly, you need to be evaluated by a mental health professional.It is unusual to hear voices and to be “checking out.” Hearing voices might be indicative of psychosis. Psychosis is a break from reality. Psychotic breaks can be stopped if caught early. Medication can disrupt psychosis and restore the mind to healthy psychological functioning. The importance of early treatment of psychosis cannot be overstated.Psychosis is a possibility but so might be a neurological problem. Brain tumors, cysts, drug usage, alcohol withdrawal, and so forth, can cause psychosis-like symptoms.Your mental health and perhaps your physical health are being compromised. Don’t ignore your symptoms. As you noted, they are greatly interfering with your life. It is imperative that you undergo a psychiatric evaluation as soon as possible. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  From the U.S.: Me and my boyfriend have been dating for about 10 months. We live two and a half hours away from each other until I graduate from college in May, but we still see each other every weekend and I stay with him whenever I have breaks. He is an amazing guy who obviously loves and cares about me a lot. Even though I know this, I will still find reasons to get upset, sometimes creating problems out of thin air. [/INST]  I’m very glad you wrote. Recognizing a problem is the first step toward fixing it. It would be a shame to end a very promising relationship like this one because you lose it for unknown reasons.If this happened only when you are drinking, the answer would be simple. Stop drinking. Not everyone can handle alcohol. Some people are nasty when they drink too much. You may be one of them. But you say this also happens when you are sober. That suggests a more fundamental issue.My only guess is that you are “testing” your boyfriend with your tantrums. If he puts up with this behavior, you may believe that it means he loves you and won’t leave. But as you point out, you may very well create the very situation you fear. No matter how much he cares for you, your boyfriend may understandably decide your tantrums are too much for him.I suggest you make an appointment with a therapist to talk this over. If you are “testing”, it is probably grounded in some past experience where you felt betrayed or left. With the help of a counselor, you can deal with the insecurity and learn to trust again.I hope you will follow through and work on this. Your boyfriend deserves better. You deserve to feel more secure in love.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m a seventeen year old student in school, and I’m trying to figure out life. I have had issues with self harm for a short time (2yrs).My parents and friends are worried that the depression and self harm arent getting any better and im sufferring.I was diagnosed with major depression recently and i feel so bad all the time.So my therapist recommended inpatient to my family because i cant take care of myself anymore.And im afraid because i know how bad i feel, and i dont want to be locked away forever.Right now im having issues with like basic hygeine,i cant sleep, i havent been eating.I want to be normal and do normal stuff young people do but i dont see the point anymore.However i have told my parents and therapist im afraid of inpatient because i dont understand how it works and whos gonna help me there.And i have never been on medication so my family thinks this is a good time to consider it as a option. [/INST]  I’m sorry you’re struggling. I understand your concern about the hospital. Apparently you’ve heard very negative things about the hospital experience. You mention your fear about “being locked away forever.” That may be part of why you fear the hospital. Your fear may also be related to not knowing what to expect in an inpatient setting. People tend to fear the unknown.I can’t be certain of what your particular hospital experience would be like but I can give you a general overview of what it might be like. It is important to note that no one can be “locked away forever” in a psychiatric hospital (or any hospital for that matter). In fact, individuals sometimes complain that their stay is too short. Generally speaking, individuals tend to stay for short periods of time in a psychiatric hospital. This is not true in every case but it is for many. Length of stay depends on the nature of one’s symptoms. Generally, psychiatric hospital stays are meant to be temporary, to help a patient stabilize. Once stabilized, the hospital staff is usually attempting to move the patient to the next least restrictive level of care, which may be a partial hospitalization program (where you attend sessions at the hospital during the day but go to your own home at night) or an outpatient setting.Your family, friends and therapist care about you. They see that you’re unstable and not doing well. They believe that the hospital might be a temporary respite to help decrease your symptoms of depression and to help decrease your desire to self-harm. If you go to the psychiatric hospital, generally there are two ways that one could be admitted: voluntarily and involuntarily. If you choose to enter the hospital voluntarily then you are free to leave at any time. Yes, the inpatient floor doors are locked but you are under no legal obligation to stay. Generally, an individual may enter the hospital voluntarily when they know they need help to stabilize and if they feel that they are a danger to themselves or others. Your family may believe that you are a danger to yourself because of your cutting behavior. They may also be concerned about your depression. Some individuals with depression contemplate suicide.Once in the hospital, you will likely meet with psychiatrists, social workers and other various mental health professionals. Their goal is to assess your situation, to make a diagnosis and to offer treatment. Their overarching goal is to ensure your safety, keep you stable and ultimately link you to an effective treatment. Perhaps outpatient therapy is not working for you now. The hospital staff may be able to reassess your situation and find a more appropriate program or a more intense treatment to better suit your needs.During your stay in the hospital, in addition to meeting with psychiatrists and other mental health professionals, you may be asked to participate in individual or group therapy. Some people find group therapy helpful while others do not. You may not be forced to attend group therapy but these groups are generally encouraged. You may also interact with other patients. Some people find this helpful because they meet people who are struggling with similar issues.Depending on the hospital, there may be certain times when phone use is restricted (i.e. during meal times, group therapy, and so forth). Most facilities will not allow you to have access to your cell phone or other electronic devices (i.e. laptops, computers, etc.) Many facilities allow visitors but like most hospitals, there will be specific visiting hours.Your case will constantly be evaluated by mental health professionals. If an individual is not a threat to themselves or to others, the hospital staff will make arrangements for the individual to leave and to attend a new program or type of treatment.If your friends, family and therapist are concerned about your well-being and are suggesting the hospital, you may want to consider their recommendations. You could go to the hospital with your family and be evaluated for inpatient admission. You can go to a hospital to be evaluated by a mental health clinician, psychiatrist or other mental health personnel who will assess your symptoms and determine whether inpatient hospitalization is necessary or recommended. This might be a good place to start. There is no guarantee that if you go to the hospital for an evaluation that you will be admitted. In many states, there are strict voluntary and involuntary commitment criteria. That means that even if you wanted to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital, there’s no guarantee that the hospital staff will admit you.I would encourage you to speak to your therapist and family about your fears and concerns relating to the hospital. Please try not to be frightened and understand that the hospital staff is not going to “lock you away forever.” They are there to help.I hope that I have shed light on what the hospital experience may be like. Please consider writing back in the near future and updating me about your situation. Also, don’t hesitate to write back with further questions. I wish you the best of luck. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From England: Okay so ever since I was very young I’ve had a problem with zoning out. When I was about 4 my parents became very worried, I zoned out in the middle of conversations and I could be walking from one room to another and end up walking into a door or wall because of it. I have two older siblings and neither of them ever did this so my mum was ready to bring me to the doctors but my dad thought it was just my age as well as an over active imagination. My older sister has aspergers syndrome so my mum feared the worst but when I was older (around 6-7) I got checked for this and like my other older sister, I was fine. I still did well in school, it never really affected that but I did zone out in class occasionally. It never went away but was less frequent after around 10 years old however now I am 15 and for at least 6 months now it seems to have been becoming more and more frequent. I’m zoning out more and more and when I finally snap back into reality I’m not even sure how much time has passed, its kind of like being in a trance. Its not like it only happens when I’m bored, I can be doing something I really enjoy and then I just zone out. I’m also developing a strange liking for a little bubble I’m starting to create, which is totally separate from the zoning out as I actually feel conscious during it. I just go into a kind of ‘bubble’ and begin imagining different things, I find this really comforting but I’m concerned about how much I’m enjoying it, I could do it for hours on end and it feels so much better then real life. I’m more concerned about the zoning out more though as I’m not actively imagining or thinking during it, I’m just kind of not there and I cant stop it happening, it just happens whenever. I definitely don’t think I have ADD or anything, I would just like to know whether I should be concerned about this behaviour or not. [/INST]  Thank you for your question. There are several possibilities — but the fact that it has become a concern is the most important thing. Since it has been going on for quite a while and it seems to be more frequent suggests it is time to bring it to the attention of a neurologist. This will help determine if this is a purely psychological or neurological happening. From there you’ll be able to put a plan together for treatment.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I have been in a relationship for over 5 years and it has been getting worse and worse. My boyfriend says it’s because I just don’t care. I do care, I just don’t know what to do or say in most situations, especially since he’s always in physical pain and blames the stress that I’m causing him for that pain. [/INST]  I am very, very glad you wrote. You and your boyfriend are both in a serious negative relationship dance that is hurting you both. It’s only a matter of time before you explode apart. My question to you is this: Do you two want to take charge of what is happening or do you want to wait for the inevitable explosion?I applaud your efforts with the workbook and meditation. I’m sure both are helpful to you personally. But the problems you are describing are with your relationship; your interactions with each other.It takes two for someone (like you) to be lying, passive aggressive, and unable to respond. It takes two (for your boyfriend) to be blaming someone else for his stress and pain. Those are behaviors people do with/against someone else.If you and your boyfriend want to save this relationship, please make an appointment with a couple counselor. You have already done what you can do on your own. The two of you need to be involved to fix this.I wish you well.  </s>"

The state you are from has some pretty serious laws about bullying, and at her age and the boyfriends behavior I’d think you’d want to talk to the school’s guidance counselor to find out about making a formal complaint.

[/INST]  Two possible explanations may explain her behavior: she lost interest in the relationship or she met someone else. Another possibility is that she has a boyfriend, even though she said she didn’t. Maybe she’s emotionally unstable. Perhaps her parents forbade the relationship. There are many possible reasons to explain her behavior. No one can know for certain, except her, why she behaved in the manner she did.The person you fell in love with has hurt you and you have to see her on a daily basis. This has to be difficult.Keep in mind that you have only known her for a short period of time. In that time, you became infatuated with her. The problem with infatuation is that it can potentially blind you to possible relationship problems. Your perception of the relationship was that almost overnight she changed but your letter describes her pulling away slowly, day by day. Because of your infatuation it may have been difficult for you to believe that the relationship was ending.Unfortunately, when relationships end, there is usually one person who is hurt more than the other. If someone decides they no longer want the relationship to continue then the other person has no choice but to comply. You are feeling hurt by your loss and understandably so.There is a very high probability that your pain will lessen with time. You won’t always feel as bad as you do. This process will be much easier once you no longer have a daily class with her.One last thing, try to think of the flip side of this negative experience. At least you were informed that the relationship was not a match early on rather than finding out years later. You are now free to search for a partner who is better suited for you and who wants to be with you. There are many women out there who would love you and appreciate you for who you are. They are there waiting for you. Keep looking and I wish you well. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.K.: I don’t know if I love my husband anymore. I feel like I’m just here for the kids. Married 11 years, 4 children. We don’t talk anymore proper just about day to day things. No kissing or hugging. Hardly any sex. Only if I have to. Don’t really want him near. Big problem is I am from another country in Europe and want to move back but he doesn’t seem to even that he always says he does. And now with the Brexit another strain on the marriage. [/INST]  You are asking very good questions. You owe it to yourself, your husband (who you describe as a “great guy”) and your kids to slow way down. The affair let you pretend for a moment that you aren’t a mom of 4 with all that involves. But if you leave your marriage, you will still be a mom and you will then have to deal with 4 kids on your own, at least part of the time, and you’ll be mothering at least 3 of them who won’t understand why you would leave their great dad.I strongly urge you to make an appointment with a therapist to help you sort this all out before you do something you will regret. It could be that your marriage has been drowned in taking care of 4 children, including 1 with special needs. It could be you have an unrealistic expectation of marriage after 11 years. It could be that the issue isn’t who you are with, but how you are with him. A therapist will help you figure out if the problem is in the relationship or in the way you and your husband have divided routines and tasks. There are other ways to get a break and reorganize your marriage without the shake up and emotional turmoil of a separation.You might find this article helpful.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am graduating in May with a degree in Psychology. My family is going through basically a break up because of my Aunt. I personally believe she has gone untreated for most of her life with either schizophrenia or a personality disorder. She could qualify for both under the DSM 5, but I know that is she has schizophrenia she would not have a personality disorder. The reason I am putting all this out there is because she has taken my great grandmother from my grandma, put her name on my great grandmother’s bank account, and is forcing my grandmother to move off her property. She brings up situations that does not make sense because they never actually happened. My great grandfather on my mom’s side was also schizophrenic and I know that it is hereditary. My mother is constantly asking me for guidance and help to understand and decide what to do with her that will benefit the family as a whole. This weekend, November 2-4, 2018, we are planning to move my grandmother and grandfather into our home to get them away from their daughter and off her property. I just do not know what we should do about my Aunt because she needs help, but we do not know how to help her. We have been thinking that we could call DSS, the police, or a mental health facility; however, she is very deceitful and lies a lot. My mother has called the police before because she was putting her children in danger, but the police officer said the only thing my mother could do is call DSS and see if they can find anything. So that did not go anywhere and she still has not received any help. I guess now we are just at a loss for what we can do for her, if we can do anything at all. If there is anything that we are unaware of that we could do, please let me know. [/INST] The fact that you are bringing your grandparents into your home may mean that this problem will worsen. Expert guidance is highly recommended.I would encourage your family to do two things: (1) consult a mental health professional with expertise in interacting with difficult people; and (2) consult an attorney. These are complex problems that are not easily remedied.Don’t attempt to fight this battle on your own. Utilize the assistance of experts who can ensure that your family is protected from any ramifications (legal or otherwise) incurred by your aunt’s actions. You can’t control your aunt’s behavior, but you can protect your family against her. That is your best course of action. I hope this helps. Good luck and please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am going to try and make this as brief as possible. I have been having thoughts of violence, of killing people. I want to make it clear that I do not want to because I think of what that can do to my future, to my family, and to my friends. I will have daydreams or dreams that are so vivid and real to me. I do things basically to try to satisfy these violent thoughts and urges by watching certain shows or movies, playing violent games and reading about violent crime scenes for example. I will admit that I used to kill small reptiles and the occasional squirrel, never cats or dogs because I like them too much and no one notices killing of reptiles. I would dissect them and see what various things would do to their bodies. This is the first time I have ever admitted to such things because I know that these signs never point to good things plus it gives people the wrong idea. I don’t know what to do or how to handle this because honestly I don’t know a psychiatrist who would see me out of fear of I might hurt them or someone else. More importantly, if I were to say anything like this or self harm or anything else along those lines my insurance won’t cover me. So if I could get any advice on something that would help or a way I could get help that would be great because right now I’m kind of stuck with myself. [/INST]  A: Thanks for writing in with your question. I’d first like to suggest that you put your worries to rest about a psychiatrist (or any other mental health professional) refusing to see you because of the thoughts you are having.These kinds of issues are included in our training and we deal with them on a regular basis. Do not let this deter you from seeking help.  Now, if your thoughts of hurting yourself or others get very serious and you and your therapist cannot come up with a plan to keep you or others safe, you may be hospitalized for a few days to be stabilized. But again, that’s not a bad thing and can be very healing. I’d also like to say that in all my years of working in the mental health field, I have never had a client lose their insurance because of what they talk about in treatment. I’ve also never had anyone lose their insurance (or job) for being hospitalized. The insurance companies typically only get data such as the diagnosis, functioning level and dates of treatment, rather than details from the sessions themselves.I recommend that you steer clear of violent shows and video games. There are those who feel that these activities are “cathartic” and help folks release these feelings rather than act on them, however, there are many experts who believe just the opposite. If you already struggle with violent thoughts and feelings, exposing yourself to these themes tends to increase these feelings rather than decrease them. If our unconscious mind controls 90% of our behavior, what do you want to be putting in there? You would most likely benefit much more from finding ways to be kind to yourself and others. Try prayer or meditation, find ways to volunteer in your community, fill your mind with thoughts of peace, and go find a good therapist or psychiatrist. All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] All my life I’ve been the outcast and honestly I prefer it that way. But I quickly realised that I’m different. I don’t really feel much. I don’t feel guilty or sorry for people and I knew it wasn’t normal for a boy at the age of 7 to be obsessed with murder and crime and killers. I knew I had to adapt and not draw attention to myself. So I created what you could say an act, a fake person. A role I had to commit to in order to seem as though I conformed, that I fit in. However, as i got older, I began to become cold and bitter but had to hide it. I wouldn’t say I’m a psychopath or anything of the sorts. I do share some similar attributes, for example I’m good at manipulating people, I’m smarter than average and I suppose in some senses i am fairly narcissistic though it pains me to say. I also like to consider that the person I am around people is confident and charismatic. All of this I have become accustom to. It is day to day life for me now. But as I come close to completing school, I realise that I’m drawn to death. The idea of killing someone is about the only thing that interests me and even for me that is worrying. The last thing I want to do is act upon such urges and find myself in prison for the rest of my life. I know this isn’t normal behaviour for any normal, functioning person but this is a last resort I suppose to really see if there is anything I can do before its too late. (From England) [/INST]   The fact that this bothers you is important. This irritation in your thinking is coming from a healthy place and I would honor that if I were in your shoes. This is often how true change begins. Several of the things you describe about the other aspects of your personality are being monitored by this worry. It takes great courage to be aware of that and admit it. Now it is time to take the next step and talk to a therapist about where these urges come from. I’d do this sooner rather than later.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been dating and living with my boyfriend for 18 months. He cheated with his ex from the start and for the first 6 months of our relationship. I caught him, he lied, then confessed – several times. He claimed he loved me and wanted me. (He told me that they were over when we got together, but he did NOT tell me that while they were indeed split up, he’d been desperately trying to get her back for 2 years and was still trying and couldn’t get over her.)  So, he claims he is finally over her now and sees her for the horrid person she is. He loves and wants me. I believe him (reluctantly and somewhat suspiciously). I am trying to trust him. Ex says she doesn’t want him but was just trying to break us up by seeing him. Unfortunately, Ex has a grandson (her daughter’s son – not his biological grandson). Ex was raising the boy (now 4 yrs) when they were together so he was also very close to the boy. She refuses to let him see the grandson claiming that HE is NOT family. [/INST]  Your best bet would be to run as fast as you can away from the situation and cut your losses before it gets any more complicated. I know that’s easier said than done, but starting a new relationship with so many barriers is going to be very difficult to overcome.Was he cheating on her with you or cheating on you with her? Either way, it’s not good. Even if their relationship was in fact over by the time you started dating, he was obviously not “over her” and had not taken enough time before getting involved with someone else. And even though you are dating him and not his family, starting a relationship off on the wrong foot with family can take a long time for things to settle down. You should really think about whether all this is something you want to deal with and if you really feel like you can trust him. If you decide to move forward, I highly suggest that you attend a few couple’s therapy sessions together. Good luck with it all.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the UK: I’m a 28 year year old female suffering from Hypothyroidism. I am really down because I am really overweight and when I’m down like this, I just comfort eat. This causes me to feel even more down so then I just eat again. It’s like a vicious cycle. I’m single and I’ve had a string of bad relationships in the past — my last boyfriend always pushed me to be a size zero and never accepted me for who I was. I have no self-confidence, I hate looking in the mirror and I hate who I have become. I feel ugly. I carry my gym kit with me to work with the intention of working out but by the end of the day, I have depleted energy and I just want to sleep. I want to take control of my life and stop eating to fill my sorrow. Right now, I have no control. Please help me. [/INST]  I hope you are being treated for the hypothyroidism. There is no need to “suffer” from it. There are medications that can bring it under control. Once you are taking the right medication, you are still going to have to confront the task of losing the weight you’ve gained. It’s not easy but it’s not impossible either.If you wait until you have a healthier self-esteem to work on your goal of losing weight, you may never get there. Self esteem isn’t necessary to be successful. Rather, it comes from being successful at something you want to do.If you want to take control, the best way to go about it is with others who are engaged in the same project. You need the support and practical help that can come from a group. Such programs as Weight Watchers and Over-eaters Anonymous are very successful because they provide both. (This is not to be understood as an endorsement of either program, only as examples. I’m sure there are other effective programs as well.)Too shy for a group? Then find a “buddy” — someone else who has significant weight to lose and is willing to meet daily so you can monitor and encourage each other. You can do this in person or online. There’s nothing so supportive as talking with someone else who “gets it” and who is as committed to the project as you are.Other hints I can offer:I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My mother is a great person, very talented, bright, amazing woman. But all her life was unstable, and have done a lot of things she seems to regret… My father especially, who she talks ill every single day. That’s where I come in for her. She calls me everyday, or wants me to call her and talk to her for hours. She wants me to support her financially ( I only turned 24) and I did support her for years now, and I never have enough to live myself! She is in good health does absolutely nothing but sits and does art and nothing else. She is in good health, she is very bright. But she doesn’t want to work, doesn’t want to do anything. She has no friend because she says that people are boring and man useless and boring to her. She tells me I am the only person that understands her! I feel we are like twins, she is always here! I cannot have my own life! She lives in Egypt and me here in LA, and still I feel her energy all the time. Draining me, so much sometimes I just want to disappear. I really want her to be happy, and to find her own life, her own path and leave me alone. I am so tired of being her whole life. I want my life back, I want to be me, I want to live. But every day I have to listen to all this problems. To how unhappy se is, how bored, how she hates relying on everyone for money, how no-one loves her. And all if it is not true! I mean it is because she made it this way, but it is not really. She can change everything. She loves playing the victim. But I feel I have to carry this life she CHOOSE for herself. And I don’t want to! Am I selfish to want my own life? To be free? To just call to say hello and chat, and be happy and light… Does it have to be so hard? Do I have to curry this burden… I just feel I do not live, I feel like I am just running around trying to apologize for her own choices… I am so tired of this. Please tell me what can I do… [/INST] Moving forward will require a bit of bravery from you. It is not your mother holding you back — it is your feelings of guilt that you are not making her life happy that keeps you locked in. Until you change, there is no reason for your mother to change. If she thinks it is okay to call you and drain your energy and time by talking to you for hours each day then she’ll continue to do it. You are enabling her poor behavior by not setting limits that honor your own life.You do not have to listen to your mom. You are 24 years old. If your mom believes you are the only one who can save her and understand her, then she’ll react that way. In the end, a system like this isn’t going to work because your mother needs to become more self-reliant. This isn’t something she’ll see as good for her — or that she’ll want to do. It is your job to set the limit in honor of your own life. I’d begin with severely limiting the phone calls and the money. I would start with keeping the conversation to a timed minimum and announcing in the beginning of the call that you will only be able to stay on the phone for half hour. State it again during the call and at the end of the time tell her you have to go and that you will talk with her tomorrow. Do not give specific information about what you have to do- or where you have to be. Just say ‘I only have a half hour for our call’ and let her deal with the situation. Your mom, unfortunately, doesn’t have enough anxiety about the right things. Believing she can take your time and money is a sign of her own lack of appreciation of your needs. You are not negotiating with your mom, you are letting her know your needs are as important as hers.Next is the money. Again, this isn’t a negotiation, this is a statement and information you are delivering to your mom. Pick a number that is significantly less than what you are giving now and let your mom know that your situation has changed and this is all you are going to be able to give. Remember, this isn’t a negotiation — it is information you are letting your mom know. We can predict that she will be upset by this, but this is necessary to help her become more self-reliant.I would also start talking about yourself more on the phone calls. My guess is you are only listening. Start changing the dynamics by talking more about your dreams and accomplishments. If I am right about this, this may be the most difficult part. Your mother sounds like she is only used to taking from you and not being there for you. Letting her know you have needs from her would be important.Finally, the way it is going now can’t work because it can only lead to resentment on your part. Your mother will feel upset by all of this, which is natural and predictable. But you not taking care of your own growth and development.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve had a partner for almost four years now, and over the course of those years he’s obviously begun to know me very well. He often jokes around with me that I’m “Bipolar” or have “mood problems”. This, however likely it is that it may seem a joke, has always made some sort of impact on me because I’ve personally felt that way myself. [/INST]  One way to find out is to make an appointment with a mental health counselor for an evaluation. I don’t have enough information to make a diagnosis. What I can tell you is that what you report is not usual for an 18-year-old and could well indicate that you have a treatable problem.A rule of thumb for me is that when a behavior or feeling is having a negative impact on relationships or daily functioning, it’s time to stop worrying and to get a professional assessment instead. Worrying isn’t going to improve the situation. Talking with a counselor may well help you name the problem and figure out what to do about it.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve been depressed since I was 9. I’m 13 now. I’ve always had real bad health problems. And my family has always treated me like a piece of crap. But recently it’s gotten worse. My grandma’s friend told my grandma a lie about me claiming I said ‘I’d cut off girls’ fingers if they came into my room! now this is a total lie. I would actually like it if a girl came into my room xD. [/INST]  It sounds like you’ve already had more to handle than someone who is only 13 should. You didn’t mention the kind of health problems you’ve had. Chronic or serious illness is enough to get anyone down. Sometimes too there are long term effects of the medicines or anesthesia (if you had to have surgery) that look and feel like depression. If that weren’t enough, for reasons neither you nor I understand, the very people who should be a source of warmth and comfort are instead blaming you and labeling you in negative ways. It must hurt terribly.I don’t know what’s going on with the family. I do know you can’t manage this on your own. You need someone who can help your family hear you. Ideally, you would all get into family therapy. But if the family is the kind that would never consider it, do at least enlist your school guidance counselor or a trusted teacher or some other adult who is willing to help sort things out. You could also ask your doctor for a few minutes in private to explain what is going on and to ask for some help.Meanwhile, develop an active life with supportive friends outside the family. If you feel good about yourself, the accusations and criticisms won’t hurt quite so much. You will know that you’re okay even if you don’t get the support and validation you should be getting from the family. Join a team or club. Eat right, get at least 8 hours of sleep a night, and make sure you get some exercise every day to combat the depression. Turn yourself into the kind of guy that other kids respect. Good friends are the best medicine for a disappointing family.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  In the last three years I’ve been in therapy with two different psychologists for social anxiety. The fact is, I’ve noticed something’s wrong with me. I believe I may have BPD, because I’ve always had many problems with abandonment, instability of relationships and mood swings, and I also meet all the symptoms of the disorder(even substance abuse and self harm).I’ve always had a confuse sense of identity,I’ve never really known who I was, and experienced dissociation and depersonalisation since the age of 11. I identify as nonbinary even though I was born female, but I know this could be a consequence of BPD.My therapist doesn’t know about my condition because she just keeps asking me only about my anxiety and everytime I try to tell her something of the above she seems to not be even listening to me. I’m writing this because recently something changed.I’ve always had very different personalities depending from who I was with, but it’s been a while since I started losing connection with reality and I can’t tell what’s real anymore.I have nightmares and most of the days I don’t know if what I experience is real or not.I see the younger me as a weak, pathetic girl who knew nothing about anything but I don’t even remember how she was or what she liked. There’s this other part of me, though, called Chrissie. She’s a childish girl who is always cheerful and behave like a psycho,I can sense her voice in my head(not like an hallucynation, just an inner voice different from mine – sometimes we have conversations)that always suggests me to do impulsive things like beating the ones who treat me badly or saying mean things.There are days when something happens and I start to feel anxious, so she takes control and I start to act so differently that the people around me ask me if I’m high or something. Since Chrissie appeared I made some researches and learnt about DID. I’m very unsure about the amnesia that should incurr though, because I happen to be co-present when she takes control, but she does what she wants and I later feel like someone else has controlled my body even though I know what happened.When I dissociate while I’m writing something I can’t remember later what I was writing before, and I noticed I have very few memories of my life before my 14th birthday, but nothing more than this. [/INST]  DID is a possibility, but that determination can only be made by an in-person evaluation, conducted by a mental health professional. Perhaps you’ve tried to discuss this with your therapist, but you didn’t communicate your concerns effectively.Alternatively, you may have been communicating effectively but your therapist didn’t think you had DID or did not know how to treat it. In any event, your concerns should be discussed more explicitly with your treating therapist. It is important to have clarity about your treatment goals. One possible strategy is to show this letter to your therapist. It might provide a fuller explanation of your symptoms.DID can be difficult to both diagnose and treat. Some therapists are not familiar with DID because it is so rare. Others are not comfortable treating it and may refer you to a specialist. Generally speaking, if you have experienced positive changes in your life, as a result of therapy and you are feeling an overall sense of positivity and happiness, then you are likely receiving good therapeutic help. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My husband left almost 3 years ago and lives with his affair partner. Before he left, he exhibited signs of depression, mood swings, and his behavior became erratic. He’s now living a completely new life in another state but yet has not filed for divorce. For the first two years, he would communicate sometimes but would not respond to legal issues. I kept busy living my life and didn’t contact him unless it was about legal matters, but I was always kind and treated him with respect. Last year I was diagnosed with advanced stage cancer and have not heard from him since. He’s even changed his contact information. I’m really struggling with understanding how I was a huge part of his life for almost two decades and even though we are still married, his actions show that he truly does not care about me. I can understand “falling out of love,” but how does someone just stop caring? My self-esteem has plummeted and it’s excruciating to feel like someone I knew for so long and shared so much of my life with doesn’t care if I live or die. I have worked hard to understand that his actions are not my fault, but I am having such a hard time accepting how he could learn that I have cancer and intentionally make my life more difficult by disappearing without getting divorced, and how he could just erase me from his life as if I never existed. I don’t want what’s left of my life to be spent dealing with this painful issue and I try not to think about him too much but I feel like our unfinished marriage is hanging over my head. [/INST]  I am deeply moved by your situation and understand the devastation following a desertion. Trying to understand his motivation and lack of caring re-injures you emotionally. No matter how many times you try to understand this story of betrayal it will leave you empty. This is a time to reclaim yourself and reconnect with those who love you — and whose care can fill you up. Building a network of social support takes some doing. Asking for help, expressing gratitude toward those who have extended their kindness, and immersing in the best self-care practices you can will help you feel better.Thoughts determine the direction of our feelings and behavior. If you dwell on him you are turning your thoughts toward more difficult and unsatisfying feelings. Focusing on what you need and the loving people in your life will be better way to go.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been diagnosed with depression and have seen therapists before. I don’t have a bad life but I am bad at handling stress. I will have panic attacks over minuscule things like homework and am anxiety prone. I will cry for almost no reason and in a second, be fine. I have really excited feelings and very very low feelings but they are not far apart like in bipolar disorder. They are within hours or at most, a day. Nobody deals with me or can figure anything out. I want to function normally but I can’t seem to figure a cause to any of it. I am in a completely stable relationship with a boy that I communicate with, although granted, I am only 16. And honestly, I almost feel like I make some of it all up. Sometimes, I feel like I will do things or say stuff just to make myself believe I have something wrong with me. I struggled with self harm for a while and I usually wasn’t distressed when I did it. I just did it to do it. I am studying psychology in school(although I am not going to be perusing a career in it) and I think that maybe since I know a bit about mental issues, I am just creating one for myself. Finally, I eat quite a lot. I eat to cope or just out of boredom and I know it’s bad for me but I haave no motivation to exercise. I hate my body but I won’t change it.

You don’t have to have a history of trauma or be going through extreme stress to need help.In addition to treating depression and anxiety, a therapist can teach you new coping strategies and improve your self-esteem, as well as help you understand yourself better.

"<s>[INST] Following issue concerns my mother who is 73, divorced (many years ago) and lives in an apartment.  Issue first happened about 2 years ago and has returned.  She starts by claiming the neighbors below her are playing music at night keeping her awake.  However, they’re not.  She continues to build on this narrative saying that they turn the music on at times like when she goes to bed.  That they’re also playing recorded audio like dialogue from a tv show and that they play it forwards and backwards.  Then it progresses to the stage that the neighbors are listening to her.  That they turn the music, etc. off when she begins talking as in a phone conversation.  During the first incident a few years ago, she claimed the neighbor had installed listening devices in the walls to monitor her.  Also during the first incident, when I told her I could not hear anything, she became vicious and verbally attacked me.  Claimed I had hearing problems, needed hearing aids and was just lying to be mean to her.  She eventually made contact with the neighbor during the first incident and accused him of playing music at night.  Needless to say, that did not go over well.  She ended up moving apartments within the complex.  In regards to the 2nd, current incident, she asked me the other day if I knew how much it would be to hire a detective.  Approaching this from a rational standpoint, stating facts like there is no music is not working.  She completely ignores reality like the fact that my hearing is much better than hers and has convinced herself that the narrative in her head is real.  I am very stressed out and worried that this is a sign of a greater problem and that she will be kicked out of her apartment.  I also have no idea what to do.  Any assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated. [/INST]  I’m very sorry to hear about these developments with your mom. It can be devastating to watch people we love develop debilitating problems. Give yourself the benefit of not fighting with her anymore. She’s convinced, and people who have this strong internal narrative are hard to convince.There are some studies suggesting that paranoia in the elderly may be something that gets activated by hearing loss and or distortion. It’s interesting that she believes you need hearing aids when the actual issue may be just the reverse. Tell her you want to help her get to the bottom of this and the first step is to understand what she is hearing and to see the sources.I would begin with a hearing evaluation. This is often less threatening than saying she is paranoid. Under the general umbrella of trying to help, offer to go for a hearing test for yourself and with her. This may help as you are saying that you are willing to follow up on her suggestion by getting a hearing test. You may want to also have a discussion with the audiologist separate from being with your mom about the fact that her hearing seems to be distorted. If you offer to go with her and expose yourself to the same hearing test — this might give her enough support and confidence to see the audiologist.The audiologist can then make some recommendations. This may be helpful in getting her in front of my psychiatrist or other mental health professional if that is needed. Since the problems have begun as a result of hearing things — and she has accused you of not having adequate hearing — this might be a way for you to help her begin dealing with the paranoia. The most difficult part here is the fact that her thinking is confirming her distortions. Losing your hearing can be very difficult phenomenon to cope with. Here is an article about hearing loss and paranoia in the elderly you might find interesting.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a young teen in the U.S.:  I’m 13 and don’t know if I’m just weird but I can turn on and turn off my apathy levels? I can turn it off and act like how people are supposed to act during certain situations (raising my empathy/decreasing my apathy).  For example, when I turn it off and something happens to a friend I feel worried and stuff but it’s also kinda feels fake? [/INST] I think what’s going on is that you trying to manage three different emotional issues at once. Your letter shows you to be an exceptionally emotionally aware person. You are going through the physical changes that happen in adolescence. And, on top of that, you mention kind of as an aside that you have been diagnosed with PTSD. Any one of those could make a person shut down (or at least try to) when overwhelmed by emotional situations.The teen years can be tough because so much is going on. You are figuring out who you are. Your body is changing. You are trying to figure out who you will love and what that love stuff is all about anyway. If that weren’t enough, you have apparently been traumatized by some event or events that were so severe that you developed PTSD in response.I hope that having a diagnosis means that you are also being treated by a mental health professional, preferably someone who specializes in trauma and adolescence. You don’t have to figure everything out on your own. In fact, it’s not even wise to try. A professional can help you manage the effects of trauma and sort out your feelings.Medication is not likely to be helpful for PTSD for someone who is only 13. No medications have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of PTSD in children. What you need is talk therapy. Trauma focused cognitive behavior therapy has been found to be the most effective. You need a mental health counselor who has those skills.The best help I can offer you is to encourage you to make an appointment right away to someone who can hear your whole story and who can provide you with regular and consistent support and advice.If you are already seeing a counselor, do take your letter and this response to your next appointment. It may help to direct what you talk about next.I wish you well. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve been having extreme mood swings ranging from wanting to scream at people and curse at anything, to not having a care in the world, to not wanting to do anything all day (not eat or bathe or move) to the next day feeling full of energy and needing to do something. Very easily bored, I always feel the need to do something. Extreme break from reality, feeling like I’m watching myself from afar, that I haven’t done things I have, like life’s not real. Constant empty feeling. I find myself wanting to binge on alcohol often and it’s a struggle to stop at 1 glass ever, even though I hate feeling drunk. I’m very easily irritated by anything. Drifting off in my own mind, only to come back to reality and realize I’ve been daydreaming for up to 30mins (this can happen anywhere). Extremely high sex drive. I’m on antidepressants that are good for irritability, but am I just depressed or is there something else wrong with me? I feel like my minds warped and have no idea what to do about it. I don’t even think I’d care if I died tomorrow, surely that’s not normal? [/INST] A: Some of your symptoms are definitely included within the diagnosis of Depression, such as lack of motivation, feelings of emptiness, irritability, not caring if you died (passive suicidal thoughts) and dulled thoughts and feelings. I’ve had some clients report feeling detached from reality at times as well.  However, some of the symptoms you describe are not typical in depression, such as feeling full of energy and having a high sex drive. These are more often seen in Bipolar Disorder, but these symptoms alone would not be enough to suggest a Bipolar diagnosis. Having a formal mental health assessment will be the best way to find out what is causing the symptoms you are currently experiencing.You mention that you are taking antidepressants so I would suggest that you speak with your prescribing physician about your diagnosis and your symptoms. Let that provider know that you are having new or more severe symptoms that concern you. I also hope that you are seeing a therapist. Many people get medications from their doctor and think that it’s enough, but medications only address symptoms. Therapists are better suited to help you understand and manage the underlying causes of the symptoms.  Finally, binge drinking may be a way of self-medicating or trying to regulate your mood. However, this will only make things worse. Drinking alcohol negates the effects of antidepressants, ultimately making you more depressed. You may feel better for a short time, but generally you will feel worse afterward. Addressing this issue with a therapist, your doctor or a support group may help you feel better also.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve been trying to find a relationships counselor who will teach strategies. I feel I’m not getting a fair go in my relationship and my partner calls all the shots due to my partner being angry, moody and controlling. I’ve done communication courses and attempt to communicate and negotiate using the formula that includes stating the facts, advising of my feelings, of my wants and needs, what I sense what my partner’s view is, posing solutions, asking what my partner thinks whilst using neutral and I language. He’s not interested in discussing how we can do some things together that we both like, going out together to build a community of friends (we have none locally) as everyone I meet is either a “snoot” or “not doing the things they should be doing”. There are 2 govt subsidized relationship services that I can get to in Sydney Australia. Working full time I need to go either at lunchtime or at the end or beginning of the day so I don’t need to take too much time off work. In spite of explaining I work full time and can’t keep taking time off work one organization will book you in but say the time is to be arranged by you and the therapist so I take a day off work then find the therapist works 10 to 3pm so I have to go and wait again to repeat the process. I also feel that boundaries is an issue so tried the other organization saw a counselor and said I felt maybe that was the problem but I wanted to be taught strategies. She said I would have to leave and I explained that I would then be carrying the cost of 2 households. I went with a second counselor who said I don’t teach strategies you talk until you figure out the answer. I asked how long that took and it can be several years. As I’ve had cancer in the past and could have a recurrence I actually may not have a few years. Also according to her I “chased” my partner but had nothing to say when I said well what else do I do, we’re told communicating is the way to go, also she felt I had a problem for wanting to find some joint activities to do with my partner and also for wanting to build a community. Are there counselors that teach strategies, go through boundaries? How does one find them? I’ll be looking at expensive private ones and can’t keep paying 1-2 sessions to sit down with someone to then find out they offer talk it through style therapies. [/INST]  I am impressed by your resilience and the fact that you keep trying to find a way. Because of the logistical problems as well as the nature of the distress between you and your partner, I would highly recommend doing an intensive workshop together rather then try to coordinate ongoing therapy.The Association of Imago Relationship Therapists Australia (AIRTA) is a very well-respected and recognized professional organization that has qualified therapists trained in a particularly dynamic approach for couples therapy. They also sponsor brief intense weekend workshops. I think this is your best bet so that you can put all the issues on the table in a short period of time.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My boyfriend has depression but it is causing other problems as a result, especially the way I feel about our sex life. My boyfriend has recently been diagnosed with depression and has been prescribed anti-depressants. He has only been taking them for a few days but he thinks that the depression may have started around 3 months ago, which is when I also noticed a change in him. Although we are both very young and have not been together long, I love him and care deeply about him and so I want to do my best to help him and be supportive. Despite this, I cannot help feeling frustrated that he isn’t always satisfying me sexually. He used to have a lot of interest in pleasuring me, which I loved, but this has decreased somewhat over time. I do not reach orgasm through sex and rely on clitoral stimulation instead. He used to bring me to orgasm quite quickly using his hands and liked doing this to me often. Nowadays I do most of the pleasure-providing and he rarely returns the favour, which makes me feel sexually frustrated, inadequate and that he doesn’t care about my needs. We have sex several times a week and I often give him oral sex, so his sex drive doesn’t seem to have been affected. However, he only makes an effort to make me orgasm about once a week or less, which seems unfair. He also grows frustrated if I do not reach orgasm quickly, as he says he starts to get less turned on. This makes it even more difficult for me to reach orgasm because I now worry about how long I take, and feel like it might be the last time I get an orgasm for a while so I have to ‘make the most of it’. Another problem is that he rarely ever gives me oral sex even though he knows I like it. I mentioned this before when I didn’t know about his depression, and he said he loved doing it and so did it to me a few times but then it stopped again. My problem is, I do not know whether his seeming disinterest in pleasuring me is down to his depression, lack of confidence because I’ve sometimes struggled to reach orgasm, or just because our relationship has gotten past the initial stage where you put in more effort to impress one another. Whatever it is, I want to know how to make it better. If I knew it was most likely down to his depression then I would not mind waiting for him to get back to his normal self, no matter how long it took, as long as I knew he would eventually become interested in me again. However I feel like I can’t bring it up without upsetting him because of his illness and the fact that I sound selfish and like I’m insulting him. I’m also scared about not saying anything in case its something that won’t go away on its own. [/INST]  I appreciate you sending us this email. I would explain what you need to your boyfriend and be clear and direct. This relationship is still young enough that you should make these corrections now before dysfunctional patterns set in. Whatever it is, his depression or his disinterest, you need to be asking what you need so he can tell you whether or not he is capable of responding. I would seek couple’s counseling, if you don’t feel his strategy has worked after three months.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My daughter recently moved into my home and shortly after I started to have problems with my boyfriend I feel like he was cheeting on me, then he got an std which thank God i didn’t get it we were not having sexist the time he rejects me all the time . So anyways I left my phone recording one morning while I took my other kids to school .. it was just to hear if called someone he was cheeting with to my surprise I hear him with a. Girl getting pleasure and towards the end he said her name and his talking to her as i walk in … she was the only one here. I confronted both of them but they deny it … now I don’t trust them alone. [/INST] Based on the small amount of information provided, it seems possible that your daughter may have been sleeping with your partner. It’s also possible that either he or she were watching pornography and that’s what you heard in the phone recording.You mentioned that he acquired an STD that he did not get from you. That would suggest that he was sleeping with another person, perhaps your daughter. If it was your daughter, she may also have an STD. You might try asking your daughter if she has the same STD as your partner.Other than continued surveillance, there may be no good way to know what may be happening between your daughter and your partner. The fact that you think it realistically possible, that your partner slept with your daughter, reveals significant potential problems in your relationship. If you suspect it to be true, then it would seem unwise to leave them alone together.Logically, either your partner is sleeping with your daughter or your partner is not. If they are sleeping together, you have a problem. If they are not sleeping together, you have a different problem. If they are sleeping together that means you cannot trust your daughter or your partner. Those problems must be rectified.If they are not sleeping together then the problem is that you seriously suspect both your daughter and your partner of doing something of which they are completely innocent. This would speak to a trust issue or even paranoia, on your part. It is important to find the truth because either way, the problem must be rectified. Counseling would be a very good place to explore this problem and to help you to find your answers.Thank you for your question. Good luck. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi :) So I recently broke up with my boyfriend and best friend (two months ago). I am at rock bottom as I’ve experienced rape, abuse, dropped out of college to pursue my ambitions but it’s not working out. He was also going through a lot, a life changing surgery and recovery. He broke up with me because he felt that he needed to regain his strength alone before using his energy on a relationship and would like to meet up after he regained his confidence. I had accepted his decision and we remained best friends. He asked for space which hurt me as I need support during my trying times and I’m getting support from my friends but not from him. He ignored my email when I explained how I felt. I feel like it’s unacceptable to ignore someone at their worst as I was there for him at his worst. I don’t know if I can forgive him for this. Am I overreacting? We were always great at communicating but now he refuses to reach out and ask how I’m doing. He’s not there for me at my worst so he doesn’t deserve me at my best? Is this rational thinking? (From South Africa) [/INST]   I would take him at his word in that he has nothing to offer you, that he is concerned with his own recovery, and that he can only meet up with you when he is feeling better. From what he seems to be saying there isn’t much here to bank on. He isn’t available to you — and is only promising to meet up somewhere down the road. This isn’t a strong hook to hang your hopes on.Take the best parts of your relationship and let yourself look for someone who can be more available for your needs. You were drawn to your boyfriend’s potential, but his reality is something different. I’d look for someone who has more of what you need to offer.This doesn’t mean you can’t be friends, but don’t expect more from what he already has told you he can give.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"

"<s>[INST] Dear Therapist, I would like to have some advice. I’m only 15 years old and very mature for my age. but thats not what i need advice about. I’m too young to be worrying about my life the way I do. i have a very good body image and I try to keep it that way as best as i can. a little too much. I believe I suffer from Obsessive Compulsive Dissorder. I havent really been able to admit it to myself or anyone around me. I believe I’ve had it for maybe two years or so, but its gotten worse over time. It starts with waking up. If i dont sit up a certain way that doesnt make me comfortanle, I lay back down. I go down stairs to eat my breakfast. if i dont see something i like on TV i have to blink 10 times or until im confortable to get the image out of my mind. in school, i cant sit on chairs without whiping it off 5 times because if i dont, i think ill get fat. i can’t touch doorknobs because im afraid ill get sick from the germs. If i smell something bad, or something i dont like, i have to “push out” the bad scent out of my nose three times and breathe in “good smells” once or twice. My friends notice that I’ve been acting strange but i usually cover it up by saying like my nose itches or there were crumbs on the seat. Its really hard for me to live with and i am soo frustrated from it. Im only a sophmore in High School. I should be worrying about school. i strongly think my grades are suffering from it too. i Already see a therapist because my mom thinks im have anger problems. but i can never bring up the guts to tell her about my suffering. What im asking is to know that I’m not the only one whos going threw this or if I’ve diagnosed myself correctly. Ive researched it and all signs point to OCD. But i also am angry all the time towards my mother. she grosses me out but i cant control it. when im around her my ‘habits’ act up. but theyre more like natural reactions than habits. I dont know if medication will help with these problems or if i need sleep or if its stress. I really need some advice because i hate living like this. Am I going crazy? (life at home) My mom some times goes a little crazy or acts stranger than usual. she yells at me than apologizes. it gives me whipelash. i know she sees a therapist and i just hope that craziness isnt heretitary. can living with someone make you sick of them? even if their your own mother? and my father is an alcholic. but he has been 7 months sober. i am the middle child and i get along fine with my siblings. although my brother often gets annoyed with me because of my breathing habits. they annoy him. I also have severe headaches. Sometimes they give me excrutiating pains and sometimes they are dull. I also feel depressed and sad all the time. I try to act happy when im around my friends but i want to feel truely happy. Im usually in my room all day after school breathing in and out in certain ways, trying to reset the “bad germs” that i have breathed in. (im sorry if ive confused you). I had a concussion in the past but im not sure if ive fully healed, or its all in my head. i get weird head aches in the front of my mind when im doing my rituals and it throws off my day. sometimes i dont feel like im in my body/mind. i feel like im always tired and i feel like im always asleep. and i dont feel my emotions to the fullest. sometimes i dont feel any emotions. its hard to explain. but i just need some advice. Im handeling this all on my own and Im not sure WHAT to do. i keep a journal of everything that goes on and it makes me more depressed. im not sure if you know what im asking or not. but please help me if you can! [/INST]  You are currently seeing a therapist. That is good but you are making a mistake by withholding important information. This makes it difficult for the therapist to help you. You do seem to have some of the symptoms of OCD but only your therapist can determine a diagnosis with certainty.My other concerns are your headaches and the possibility of an existing concussion. I would recommend reporting these symptoms to your mother immediately. She needs to know about the headaches so she can relay this information to your primary care physician. The majority of people occasionally experience headaches. That is normal but your headaches seem unusual because they are associated with OCD rituals. This needs to be reported to a physician. It is important to determine the nature and cause of your headaches.The next steps for you are clear: speak to your therapist about your OCD symptoms and meet with a physician about your headaches. Your therapist can help you with the OCD but not if he or she is unaware of the problem. OCD tends to be a progressive disorder which is why it is important that is treated sooner rather than later. I hope that my answer helps you to proceed correctly. If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to write again. Good luck. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I am a 16 year old male and a sophomore in high school. I am a part of a team that is an after school activity. It is structured somewhat similarly to a debate club. The activity includes people from each class (Freshmen, Sophomore, Junior, Senior). [/INST]  Relationships can serve many different purposes. It could be that this young woman values your contributions in the club and finds you intellectually stimulating in a way that she doesn’t get from other people. It could be that she sees you as a “little brother”, not in a dismissive way but as someone younger she wants to encourage and mentor. Or your confusion could be a result of your personality differences. As you know, INFPs tend to be passionate about whatever they are excited about. She may not know how to show that interest without being confusing. Meanwhile, INTJs tend to be overly analytical. So you may be over-thinking this whole thing.The most direct way to figure it out is to ask her. Yes, I know. That’s hard to do. But surely it is no more difficult than being confused about what she means and what she wants from you.Just keep it light. You might find a private moment and say something like, “I really admire how much you bring to our club and I’m glad to be your friend. But sometimes I find how you treat me a little confusing, especially since you are a senior.” Then be willing to listen. See where it goes. I have a guess that she doesn’t have any idea that she is making you uncomfortable. Be prepared to reassure her that you aren’t looking for romance; that you just want to better understand what she has in mind.You have another half year of school before she graduates. You’d probably like that time to be as comfortable as possible. Good communication is the route to being easy with each other.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: I’m a 14 year old girl and I feel like I’m not attracted to straight guys. I’m only attracted to gay guys. I’ve had boyfriends but it’s not normal. I like them but I feel different when I’m with gay guys or even just seeing them. When I see or hear or anything about a gay guy or gay couple I feel something inside me and my heart just starts to race like crazy. I’ve even had a dream and I was a guy with a boyfriend and I felt like that’s what I liked. I just don’t know what to do and I could really use some help. [/INST] Thank you for writing. Being 14 is really hard these days; I think even harder than it was in my generation. There is so much pressure to be in a relationship, even if you’re not really ready. To escape the pressure, some kids find a “safe” relationship. This might be with a good friend of the other sex who also wants to have fun but stay platonic. Other straight kids sometimes find gay friends to take the issue of sex out of the relationship. It’s another way to be social and have fun without the pressure.On the other hand, you are at an age when your body is changing and you may find you are more emotional than you used to be. It is normal to be exploring your own emerging sexuality. It often takes years to settle into yourself. In time, you may find you are straight, bi, nonbinary, trans, or sexually fluid. Maybe you are now exploring other possibilities besides being straight to try to understand who you are.We live in a time where there is more visibility and more conversation about other ways of being besides just straight or just gay. In addition, rigid stereotypes about how to be a man or woman are being challenged. Kids have a wider range to explore about how to be and be accepted by their peers and the adults who love them. It can be felt as a relief or as more pressure.If there are adults in your life that you trust who have had different life experiences, you might seek them out to talk about their perspectives about what it was like to be a teen struggling with definition of self.There’s no right time or right way to figure it out. Stay open and curious and accepting of yourself. You will know when you are ready.Avoid making an announcement of your identity until you are pretty sure. No matter what your identity, there will be new pressures from both people who support you and people who don’t. Take your time until you can be as clear and strong about your discoveries as you know how to be. There’s no hurry.At 14, every year seems like it takes forever. That’s because it’s only a fourteenth of your life. As you get older each year will seem longer because it is a smaller and smaller percentage of your life. My point is that you have decades to figure this out and celebrate who you truly are with the people who will love and respect you for you.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Ireland: I met this girl at an open party I was having in my house and fancied her immediately, this was about 8 months ago and I saw her in university a lot since then too. But, around February this year, she came to another party with me and stayed over. We started dating very soon after. However, she is unable to be affectionate with me. She cant stand to be touched by me except kissing, unless she is drunk, then she’s all over me. She revealed to me that she’s got depression and is on medication for it a couple of weeks into the relationship. [/INST]  Sure. There’s always a chance. But I wouldn’t bet on it. It sounds to me like she is telling you as kindly as she can that she loves you as a friend but isn’t interested in taking the relationship to another level – at least for now.

I hope she is also wise enough to take care of herself and get into treatment.I also applaud you – for seeing through the problems to the person underneath.

"<s>[INST]  My boyfriend and i have been together for two and a half years. We have an 11 month old daughter together. Lately he says he is losing interest in me and he loves me but he is not in love with me anymore and he wants to get his own place. our sex life when we got together was amazing and now we don’t hardly ever have sex and he is always at his friends house. never home to spend any time with me or our daughter. He is constantly packing his stuff and saying we are done and then leaves but then is back within the hour or so. The longest he stayed away was two weeks but then he came back. Things had been going well or so i thought but i just do not know what to do. I feel like i’m being needy but i just want to spend time with my boyfriend instead of him constantly going over to friends house whenever we get off work. Its affecting my daughter as well. She doesn’t see her dad but maybe an hour out of the day. I am at a loss. i love him and i dont see myself with anyone else [/INST]  You and your boyfriend got together when you were only 18. At 20, you had a baby. It sounds to me like you boyfriend is ambivalent about taking on adult responsibilities and being a father. On the one hand, he probably loves his little girl and still has strong feelings for you. On the other hand, he may feel he gave up his youth too soon. If his friends are single and responsibility-free, it makes it even harder for him to move to the next stage of adult life.The two of you need to have a very serious talk about what each of you wants out of life and your relationship. You are parents but you aren’t married. That alone tells me that both of you have had some reservations. You may not see yourself with anyone else, but you didn’t make a total commitment either.I think you need to take a big step back from assuming you are going to be together. Come at the talk as a decision you both have to make. Are you both going to give up the single life? Are you going to marry? Are you both ready to do what it takes to make a permanent relationship with each other and a two-parent home for your daughter? If not, how are you going to co-parent? Ideally, your daughter will have both a mother and a father who are actively involved in her care and in her life. How are you going to support her financially?You may need some help to have a productive conversation about these difficult and emotional issues. If you find you get nowhere when you try it on your own, I hope the two of you will see a couples counselor for a few sessions. The counselor’s office can give you both a safe place to say what you feel and to figure out what you want for the three of you in the future.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m not a fan of yelling.. If I do then I’ve been pushed really far. My husband comes from a family that routinely treated him insignificantly and verbally/emotionally/ and to some degree physically abused him. His father was a preacher, he grew up in ministry. He has had several relationships that follow that same path. Yelling makes me uncomfortable, and it never seems to solve anything, so I only do it when if feels like the only way to get attention–and then I feel horribly afterwards. The thing is, my husband likes getting yelled at.. Not in a smiles and loves it kind of way, but in a “finally I’m getting what I deserve” relief kind of way. And he’s either cruel to me to the point of my fighting back, or ignored anything I say completely..he’s not a violent or perverted man, just seems to think he deserves abuse and degradation, and won’t hear or accept anything other than that. I’ve put 5 years into starting with positive encouragement that has teetered into more yelling–and I hate myself more and more for it, until today I just told him I would give him what he wanted, and tore into him and watched him lower his head and solemnly find relief in the lashing, like somehow he was martyring himself so that I could feel good or powerful or something… And while I was yelling I pointed out to him how much he looked finally at ease.. Then he broke down and cried.. Sobbed.. And it went on.. Until I finally stopped. After awhile he admitted how much he enjoyed the yelling and was hoping I would hit him, and how ludicrous that was. He finally sees this, but why is he like this? How do we go on from here? I can’t find anything out there that seems to address this problem. I kind of think it’s the unhealthy upbringing his parents instilled in him of his lack of value and his deserving the abuse he used to receive… What is going on? [/INST]  I can only guess at why your husband responds this way since I’ve never talked with him. If his father believed that we’re all sinners and that our sinfulness has to be beaten (verbally and physically) out of us, then chances are he parented from that conviction. The route to parental approval in such a household would be to be a martyr. It’s the only way to become a “saint.”I think your husband needs therapy, not more martyrdom. You can’t be asked to replicate an unhealthy relationship so that he’ll feel better — at the cost of his dignity and self-esteem. It’s unhealthy for both of you.If he won’t go, go yourself. You could use some new ways to talk to him as well as some support for holding your own line. Once he sees that therapy is helpful to you, your husband may join you.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi, I’ve recently become more aware of how harmful my intense and random anger is. It’s a serious problem that I want to get control of. It’s threatened my relationship with my girlfriend who is the best thing that has ever happened to me, and that I love immensely. I didn’t really understand how much my anger hurt her. I hate that I’ve hurt her, I only want to make her happy and always treat her right. Also I know I don’t want to live like this. [/INST]  I think you’re right. You need to make an appointment. Fortunately, you’ve had a positive experience in treatment before. There’s every reason to think another “chapter” of therapy will be helpful. I encourage you to follow your own instincts about getting the help you need. The love for your girlfriend, and your healthy desire to live differently will help you stay motivated.I can’t tell from your description whether you have BPD or not. There are a number of diagnoses that include difficulties with anger management and the list of symptoms you describe. BPD is the most common to meet those criteria but certainly not the only one to include unstable relationships and emotional dysregulation. I encourage you to get an evaluation by a qualified mental health professional. Whatever the diagnosis, an evaluation includes recommendations for what are the most promising treatments.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m a 23 year old male living with my father in an apartment. I find that I have no motivation, fail at everything I’ve attempted so far in my life, and reflecting on myself, I have come to a conclusion that I actively hate myself, to the point I think I may be self-sabotaging… Some days I want to die… just end everything, but I have always hated the idea of suicide… And am too afraid of hurting those who care for me, and I feel like killing myself would only result in dumping upon them all the unresolved problems I leave behind… My life is a mess… I have no job, have dropped out of school and am facing massive debt… and all because I can’t stand my existence… I even sabotage all my friendships… and by the time I realize it, they’ve moved on. Who am I? Why the hell do I feel so disconnected from everything… including myself? I can’t sleep at night because I can’t shake these questions out of my mind… and when I do sleep, the same questions haunt me in my nightmares… I’m lost…. and I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried telling my family… but they don’t understand my reasoning… and I’ve hurt them so much by my actions (or lack thereof) that feel like they’re giving up. I want to know why I feel so out of place in this world… like I’m so different that I can’t even relate to the people around me. One reason I can’t make sense of it, is that I’ve committed to certain things before in my life without a second thought… such as not drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes… being kind and considerate to others… and being patient and level headed. Why can’t I apply that same tenacity to anything else? I’ve tried… but I can never manage to pull it off… I know asking these kinds of questions online is not always reliable…. but I have no one to turn to… and no money to invest in serious counseling… so I don’t know what to do. Any advice… anything at all… even an angry or hateful response… is appreciated, I just need SOMETHING. (age 23, from US) [/INST]  First of all, there is no way that you can fail at everything you’ve attempted in life. You need to examine the “measuring stick” that you are using. Maybe you are struggling with school and employment right now, but using some of your other examples like committing to not drinking or smoking, practicing patience and being kind to others are things that other people struggle with (even people with stable jobs). All of us have strengths and weaknesses. All of us have things that come easy to us and things we really have to strive for and put extra effort into. It’s part of being human.If you are not finding helpful answers within yourself right now, it is time to look elsewhere. If you are feeling disconnected, then you need to search for ways to connect. Therapy is certainly one way to do this and you can look into what services your local community mental health center has to offer, but you may find other ways to feel more connected as well.Try volunteering for a cause you care about, try a new hobby, or take one class in college instead of taking a full load. Set your goals small so that you can begin to feel some success and then build on this.

"<s>[INST] hello im 14 but i don’t want to say my name. i have a bad problem controling my impulses, and im quite reckless, not in a way of hurting myself but, doing things without thinking about the consequences. when im at school i dont fit in at all, but i always try, i try to mimic things that other people do. but i just cant fit in. i get angry, very fast, it doesn’t take that much for me to want to kill someone. i cant controll anything about me, i have alot of anxiety, too much, i can over react. someone scammed me two days ago and i have been contemplating killing him, beating him with a bat, or hiring someone to do something to him, but its very irrational. it just makes be soo mad. when im mad i forget about everything and cant think. i have thought about killing myself because im tired of living that way. ill be on the verge of doing something that i could go to jail forever for, then at the last minute i start to remember what the consequences will be. i like somone one day, the next day i hate them. i dont know who i am, i dont have any goals, at night i get very paranoid, of ghosts and irrational thoughts. and hallucinate at night alot. at some points i will be happy for a few days, because i think im in a movie. i remember periods of time in my life, as what was going on in my mind. [/INST]  Many teenagers struggle with similar problems. People underestimate how difficult it is to be a teenager. You could greatly benefit from counseling to control your impulses. Impulse control is a correctable problem with treatment.Counseling would be a tremendous help for you in understanding and dealing with the problems of a 14-year-old. Twelve through 18 is a tough time for most normal teenagers. Really tough. We get through it, but it would be much easier with counseling.You recognize that your behavior is irrational and out-of-control. That is encouraging. People who are open to treatment and who see that it is necessary are the most likely to benefit from it.Your next steps should be asking your parents for their assistance in seeking mental health treatment. You can also speak to the school guidance counselor about this problem. They can provide you with immediate assistance and refer you to a mental health professional in the community. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  I’m 17 and I have been with my boyfriend for about 9 months now. And he has been battling severe depression for many years. It’s constantly fighting against him, and makes it hard to have discussions about our relationships because it just consumes him and leaves me to have to abandon the problem to help him build himself up. He has thoughts of self harming and committing suicide. He has cut himself twice while we have been dating, punched windows and graveled walls, and has attempted suicide three times. I try to help him as best I can but he solely relies on me to help, and I’m not in any shape to take care of another person 24/7. I have little room to worry about myself and my needs. I love him very much but it is very difficult to have someone else’s worries on my back to carry. I want him to reach out to a therapist for help but he tells me he will do it on his own, but a therapist would be able to help him more than I can. He mentally abuses me and traps me in the relationship by threatening himself when I want to leave the relationship so I can help myself. I’m stuck between leaving for my own good, and staying to help him because I don’t want him to get hurt. Please help me. [/INST]  You are absolutely right. Your boyfriend isn’t holding you close through love, he’s holding you hostage. He knows it would be hard for you to live with yourself if you broke up with him and he hurt himself. It’s unfair. It’s not at all what love is about.I think you are also right that you can’t carry him any more. It’s time to call in reinforcements. If his parents are decent people, arrange to have a talk with them. They have a right to know that he is in this much trouble. They are in a position to insist that he get help. If you don’t think his parents are a good bet, then please talk to your school counselor or nurse or to a favorite teacher.Please don’t worry about “betraying” him by calling in some help. Some secrets shouldn’t be kept. Even therapists are released from the rules of confidentiality when someone is threatening or practicing suicide. Our first job is to keep someone alive.Turn this fellow’s care over to someone who has the resources to actually be helpful. Then break off the relationship and take some time to recover. You might want to see a therapist yourself to help you learn from this experience and to help you deal with any guilt and anger you may be feeling.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi there, my mother was diagnosed with Bipolar about four years ago after years of misdiagnoses. She has been on Risperidone for about 4 years now and has usually been okay. But in the last year she’s had two episodes, not full-blown but bad enough to cause us all stress (her family). I have two questions today: Does this mean the medication is no longer working? And secondly, her symptoms are listed anywhere as being Bipolar symptoms so I’m wondering whether you can shed some light. She often speaks French when she’s having an episode. A language she never speaks nor does she speak it correctly, it’s almost as if she’s making up words. She then puts on a French accent when speaking English and cannot pronounce her R’s anymore. She also acts unlike herself by singing constantly or mumbling under her breath as she’s walking around the house. It’s been like this for a week now and she’s taking one Risperidone a day…is any of this characteristic of Bipolar Disorder? She obviously has the paranoia and the delusions that someone is looking at her or whatever. I’m 27 years old and she’ll act like I’m her 5 year old daughter if we walk outside or in the streets, as if I might get kidnapped. Please help! I am deeply saddened and stress just caring for her. Any advice would be much appreciated! Thank you. [/INST]  Her active symptoms might indicate that her medication is no longer effective. It could also mean that she has stopped taking her medication.It’s common for individuals with psychotic disorders to stop taking their medication. In fact, it’s one of the most common barriers to effectively treating psychotic symptoms, which is why some mental health professionals advocate injections over pills. Injections, unlike pills, can’t be spit out, “cheeked” or otherwise discarded.Your second question relates to her language problems. Her words might sound like French but may not be French. Language abnormalities are common among people with schizophrenia and sometimes bipolar disorder, during manic phases. Common speech abnormalities include poverty of speech, pressure of speech, speech derailment, loose associations and incoherence.Psychosis rarely gets better on its own, but it can be managed with antipsychotic medication. Contact her prescribing physician and report her symptoms. Her doctor can intervene with medication, which could prevent a full-blown psychotic episode. If you fear for her safety, then take her to the hospital. They can provide immediate help and keep her safe. I hope I’ve answered your questions. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  From a teen in Australia: I am 15, my sister: 13. The past two-ish years, I have a growing built up anger towards her. It has gotten to the point where I’m simply in her presence and I can feel myself getting angry and I swear a lot in my head at her, and I haven’t held a conversation with her for 2 years. (Other than questions like, “where’s the bread?”) And whenever she does try and start conversation with me saying” [My name] guess what happened” I get genuinely mad and annoyed and barely respond. [/INST] I’m very glad you wrote. Feeling always in second place must be very painful. It sounds to me like you have been such a good kid, your mother doesn’t worry about you. She knows you will be okay. But she apparently has major worries about your sister. Is it possible that your sister isn’t as smart as you are or that she has some other problem that worries your mom?It’s an unfortunate truth that a kid who seems to be doing fine often gets kind of taken for granted in a family, especially when another kid seems to need special attention to be even mostly okay.You seem to be taking your frustration out only on your sister. It is your relationship with your mother that I’m more concerned about. She may be quite unaware of how you are feeling since you work so hard to be the “ideal” kid. I wonder what would happen if you had an honest discussion with her about how you do need some of her attention — and even praise now and then. If you can find a way to talk to her calmly about it, you may be surprised at how clueless she has been about how you feel. The two of you might be able to work out some special times in each week for just the two of you.If you and your mom can work out a more friendly relationship, I think you will find much of your anger at your sister will evaporate.You didn’t mention your dad. If he is in the picture, it may be possible to form a special bond with him while you work on things with your mother.I wish you well, </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: My mom thinks that there is something wrong with me. Something that stops me from being nice to everyone that is close to me, like my sibling. She thinks that I WANT to cut off all the joy in my life. [/INST]  This will be hard for you to hear, but I’m with your mom. She doesn’t have the best way of saying so, but I think she is right to be concerned about you. Being “mean” is not “just the way you are”. No baby is born into the world to be a mean person. No one comes into the world ready to fight, punch and kick a sibling. No one comes into the world antisocial, proud or otherwise.I don’t know what is wrong. I only know something certainly is. I hope you will see a counselor who can get to know you and who can help you become the person you are meant to be.And, please. Don’t refuse services just because it will look like your mother is winning. Real freedom, real independence, means that you do what’s good for you — even if your mother would like it. Take care of yourself.I wish you well.  </s>"

"<s>[INST] In 2002 (I was 17) I met a guy (he was 26) hung out in a group that one night. He was recently divorced after a 7 yr marriage. I got married that same year. Never saw this man again. Until 2 1/2 years ago I was going through a divorce after being married 6 years. We ran into each other. Remembered each other. After getting to know one another, and building a friendship over 5 months, we started a relationship. Been together ever since. I am now 26, and he is 35. I have 2 sons from my marriage. He has no children of his own, but loves the boys like they’re his. And their father has since passed away, so he is now their sole father figure in their life. We have lived together as a family for 15 months. Even recently bought a house together. So, that’s a brief history. For the most part we have a great relationship. The main cause of our problems stems from his friendships with females. One in particular is a girl who he had one night been intimate with, but they’ve always been just friends. She started talking to him again about 8 months into our relationship, and he started going over 1 or 2 nights a week to watch movies with her and her sister and their children. (The sisters lived together) At first it wasn’t a big deal to me. Until one night I found out that without telling me, him and a friend of his picked her up one night and they hung out together, and some inappropriate (in my opinion) stuff happened. I got very upset, and it caused us to argue, and this arguing caused him to walk out, and we didn’t talk for 2 days, and he admits that the night he left my house, he went to her house and stayed all night bc he’d had a few beers. (Nothing happened) Ok. Several weeks later, he has one too many drinks and opens up about that night. He tells me he was upset and was discussing our problems with this girl, and she started crying and said to him: I wish you could love me like you love her. I’ve always thought we’d be good together. Of course this upsets me. So, he continues to communicate with her via texting, but he stops hanging out with her. Then, my ex husband passed away rather tragically. We disagreed about some issues and once again he walked out of my house, and we didn’t talk for 4 days. When we finally talked, we agreed to take a 30-day break, and if we still wanted to be together, we would start over. (We laid out ground rules: no communicating at all, unless it was to say we wanted to move on because we’d found someone else. We didn’t want to be unfaithful to each other. We were still considering us to be together, we were just taking a break to think things through) ok, so the next day we meet up and exchange house keys, etc. When I saw him (we hadn’t seen each other in 5 days) he looked awful. He looked tired, worn out, his eyes were swollen. It was obvious he’d been crying a lot. We hugged, and parted ways to begin the 30-day break. Early the following morning he texted and said he wanted to talk. So, we talked. He cried, and said he felt like we’d proved a point, he knew he didn’t want to live without me and the boys and he asked how I felt, and so we agreed to move forward and continue building our family. Of course I learn he pretty much spent the whole 5 days we were apart surrounded by all his friends including the 1 girl I have a problem with. That very day we get back together we see this girl in a parking lot and he waves at her and she doesn’t wave back. He doesn’t seem to care. Ok. Within the month we move in together. A week or so later we are laying in bed and he starts going through his phone and let’s me see where he had been texting her and getting no response and so he asked if she was mad and she finally responded with: I just don’t like how you handled everything. He says she means she is upset that he chose to stay with me. So, she ends up inviting him to a birthday get together and he declines BC I pretty much said no way. And he made a promise that he would never make plans to see her in person again. A whole year goes by with no communication between them and almost 4 months ago she pops up again and they’ve talked constantly since then. He works for a cable company. So he went to her house and installed cable. That was fine. Then he decides he wants to set her up with a friend of his, so him and his friend go to her house. A couple weeks later I specifically ask him if he has seen her other than those 2 times. He says no he has not. So, He ended up getting a new phone, so one day I looked through his old phone and was able to read text messages. I discovered that over a 4 week period he had hung out with her 4 or 5 times. Of course, 2 of those times I know about, the other time he flat out lied. He says it was all BC he was trying to set his friend up with her. This upsets me very much and of course we argued. Pretty much was going to end things. But, once again talked things through. Let me add that I have no concerns of him physically cheating on me. It’s the emotional part that upsets me. It hurts my feelings knowing that he sits and thinks of her and then feels the need to text her to see how her day is. I’ve expressed this to him numerous times. I understand he knew her years before him and I got together. He has explained to me that in a way she reminds him of his ex wife. She is very small and timid and shy and comes off as being fragile. She doesn’t have a lot of friends and she’s been burned a lot by family and friends. She told him years ago that she felt like she could tell him anything and she trusted him more than she had ever trusted anyone. She has a 3-year-old son. She is a single mom. Apparently the father has never been in the picture. Yes, he admits he feels sorry for her. He cares about her as a person. She’s always been nice to him. He says he can talk to her about anything. He can say anything he wants and if she gets mad, who cares? Because he doesn’t have to live with her. Oh and let me add…I have never met her. One way I described my feelings about the situation to him is: “She needs to find her own knight in shining armor.” Yes. I feel sorry for her. I have a ton of respect for her as a single parent. I know she’s a good mom and a hard worker. Does it make me an awful person to feel like “oh well.”? Not our problem?” I’ve never been a jealous person until all these issues the past 2 years. And once again, I truly don’t feel like he’d ever be physically unfaithful. His friends and family who’ve known him his whole life say the same. He’s been burned several times by unfaithfulness. He has several female friends that were in his life before me. I’ve met them and developed friendships with them. But, not this girl. She has stayed away. And if she does invite him to something she doesn’t include me in the invitation. It just really bothers me. The whole situation. What bothers me the most is the fact that she has expressed her feelings toward him, even crying that she wished he loved her the way he did me? And then he’ll tell me how emotionally unstable she is and she’s fragile and he can’t just kick her to the curb, she’s never done anything to hurt anyone she is one of the nicest people he knows. I feel that by him staying in her life it gives her false hope and if she is as bad off emotionally as he says, he’s possibly setting her up for a huge breakdown. That’s just how I feel. I apologize for how long this is and I hope you can make sense of it. Thanks so much. [/INST]  What you are saying makes a great deal of sense, and it is very clearly laid out. I believe there is something called a parallel process at issue here. By not giving him an ultimatum and setting a clear boundary, he is not setting s clear boundary with her. The result is that a type of permission and enablement that allows the confusion and ambiguity to continue. What you have now is a relationship based on potential and promise — rather than actuality.Ask him for exactly what you want, and set limits on what is acceptable and what isn’t. If you want a more committed relationship then you need to ask for it. If his lying about his contact with her is a deal breaker in the future — say so.Three people in what should be a 2-person drama never succeeds. If you can’t set limits, goals and boundaries with him, he isn’t going to be able to set them with her. Is this an ultimatum? Perhaps. But I prefer to see it as your basic statement of needs.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S. My husband was good father but verbally abusive at times and hard on the youngest of our 2 daughters. However, deep down I do not believe that he molested her. She has no memory of actual sexual abuse but says he rubbed her feet sometimes, got too touchy, kissed her neck once and made her feel uncomfortable many times. She says she has memories of going to bed with her clothes on as a child. I put her to bed every night and do not remember this ever. They always had a stormy relationship. [/INST]  This is terribly painful for all involved. It is far too complicated a situation for me to be helpful with advice from afar.From my point of view, the most effective and helpful way to untangle such a mess is with a family therapist who is dealing with everyone. Individual therapists can potentially get caught up in the perspective of the individual they are seeing. Your daughter’s therapist’s priority is supporting her. Your husband’s therapist is supporting him. But no one is getting everyone into a room to work it out together.Your family needs healing as well as the individuals. A family therapist deals with the family system as a whole. The family therapist’s job is to make a place that is safe enough for everyone to speak their mind and heart so that all family members feel heard and supported. When that is done well, it is possible for family members and the family as a whole to heal.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From South Africa: Hello. My fiance’s mother passed away last year from cancer, so we took his 8 year old brother into foster care. At first it was fine, but we are having problems with him lying a lot. He says he lies because he does not want to get into trouble, although we have explained many times that he will be in bigger trouble if he lies. He recently started swearing at the older kids at school, when I asked about it he lied about the words he used and who he said it to. [/INST] What a difficult situation. I applaud you for taking this boy into your home and your heart. You are suddenly parenting a child who is dealing with both loss of his mother and the changes in expectations for his behavior that came with coming into your home. I’m sure he is struggling. And i’m not at all surprised that you are struggling too.Kids grieve in many different ways. It is not unusual for anger to be mixed in with the sadness. It is normal for him to feel angry about the loss of his mom, upset that his life has been turned upside down, and unable to manage his many emotions. Please don’t feel that at times you aren’t up to the task.So, yes. You should go back to therapy, not just for him but for your whole family. A family therapist will help you all (you, your fiance and the boy) understand the changes that are necessary to keep him physically and emotionally safe. Therapy will give him a safe place to express his feelings and to hear your love as well as your concerns about how to help him. A therapist will also give you new tools for providing him with the loving discipline he needs.There is no way you could have been prepared for this sudden leap into parenthood. Give yourself, your fiance, and the boy the gift of the support and practical help a therapist can offer.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I recently finalized a highly contentious divorce with an abusive spouse who used horrific tactics to emotionally abuse me, tear me down, turn people against me, and even take my son away for a period of time (using my mental health as an excuse, which is absolutely not a factor and was exacerbated by him). My parents have been on his side through the entire process and I have essentially cut them out of my life for the time being in order to attempt to heal from all of this. During the last part of our marriage, he used tracking devices on me, routinely went through my personal items and phone, and the divorce process intensified his verbal abuse, where I was regularly gaslighted and berated. [/INST]  All of the questions that you have asked and the issues that you have raised, belong in and to the realm of counseling. A short-written answer could never satisfactorily serve as a “second opinion.” Your therapist should provide you relief from your problems. If he or she cannot advance you towards your goals, then you must find one who can. You say that you have “discussed” these things with your therapist. From the letter that you have written, it would seem that the issues raised deserve to be the main focus of your therapy. Are they? If not, why aren’t they? Are you being fully disclosing with your therapist?I would like to have known why your parents chose to side with your ex-husband. You must realize, that this is highly unusual. Did he lie to them? Did he fool them into believing lies about you? And finally, what reasons did they give for siding with him?Self-questioning is appropriate and advisable when you recognize that you have made mistakes. I don’t know you, and I certainly cannot render an opinion. Perhaps you have made mistakes and the self-questioning process that you are going through will help you to find insight and prevent you from making similar mistakes in the future. Or, perhaps you have made no mistakes at all and thus the self-questioning that you’re going through could not possibly be fruitful in helping you to prevent mistakes that never occurred.Self-belief is different from self-confidence. You may believe that you could learn to fly an airplane. But how confident are you that you could jump into a small plane at a local airport, without any training, and successfully take off and land? Without lessons, you should have no confidence in your ability to do so. If you have great confidence, without having learned how to fly, you possess false confidence. Confidence can be correct or false. Overconfidence is harmful and is based on a misjudgment of reality. Under confidence is also wrong and is also based on an incorrect perception of what is real.Abraham Maslow states that an optimist, is as equally wrong as a pessimist. Both have misjudged reality. Is the glass half full or half empty? What is the truth? What should you believe? In reality, 4 ounces in an 8-ounce glass is both half full and half empty. The optimist denies reality and so does the pessimist. The optimist denies that the glass is half empty and thus is wrong. The pessimist denies that the glass is half-full and thus is also wrong.We must always judge reality correctly. If not, we will certainly pay for our mistakes.The issues that you’ve raised are complex and deserve to be fully examined during the therapeutic process. They are deserving questions and I can fully understand your concern. No real help can come from having a question answered by a stranger on the Internet. Perhaps a little insight can be garnered but any real, significant, substantial help, can only come through adequate therapy. That is the path that you must pursue, in my most humble of opinions. I sincerely wish you good luck in your journey. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I am the oldest of two and my mom passed in 2004. Since the passing of my mom I tend to step up as mother unintentionally. In 2014, I gained custody of my sister’s two children without having any children of my own. It’s been very hard on me and even harder on my sister. [/INST]  I wish I had a little more information. You didn’t share how it is that you have custody of your sister’s kids or what services have been provided for you both. It seems that you are trying to do a great deal without the information or support you need to do it well.If you haven’t already, please contact the Department of Disability Services (http://www.dds.ca.gov/). Your sister needs to be evaluated for whether she qualifies as a person with intellectual disability and whether she is eligible to receive a variety of supports.Having had a number of traumatic experiences, your sister may need some intensive therapy as well. She won’t be able to parent as you (and she) would like her to until she has supports (other than you) and treatment geared to helping her reach her goals. Even with treatment, it may not be possible for her to be a full time parent. In that case, treatment would be focused on helping her make peace with that fact and with determining the healthiest way to be part of her children’s lives.Meanwhile, it sounds to me like you are ambivalent about being the kids’ primary parent. At 30 years old, it probably isn’t what you had in mind for this stage of your own life. It’s good of you to step up, but you may need more help than you currently have to parent well and without resentment.The fact that the kids are “terrorizing your home” suggests that they are upset as well. For that reason, I suggest you get an appointment with a family therapist who can help you navigate what resources are available to all of you. The preschool teacher may be able to make a referral for you.You don’t have to go it alone. There really are resources available in your state to help you.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  I grew up bouncing from house to house. Sometimes with my mom, but most of the time with grandparents or having my sister look after me. My father left when I was 2 and popped his head in here and there. He and my mother are both addicts. My mother got clean when I was 15, but is still an alcoholic. Because of their addictions, I never really had a real home, let alone parents. I was never able to count on them and they were constantly letting me down. When was 17 and graduated high school I left for college and never looked back. I knew I needed to make something of myself so that I would not turn into them. [/INST]  You already have a pretty good idea about what the problems are. I would agree that the symptoms you report probably add up to Agoraphobia and/or Social Anxiety Disorder and OCD. I’m glad you are searching for answers. I’m especially glad that you are concerned about the effect your issues may have on your little daughter. Both of you deserve to be able to go to the playground and to do the normal errands of everyday life without you falling apart.I understand completely why going to see a therapist puts you right in the teeth of the problem. If it were easy for you to get to the therapist, half the work would already have been accomplished. Often people with your issues find it easier to get out of the house if someone they trust is with them. If that is the case with you, please consider asking your husband to go to therapy with you — not because he is in any way at fault but because you need the crutch, at least at first. Your therapist will help you get comfortable and will help your husband learn some practical ways to be more supportive of you. Eventually, you’ll be able to continue your treatment on your own.Although medicine may take the edge off your anxiety, it alone is not going to be enough to help you get better. Cognitive-behavior therapy plus medication has been shown to be the best treatment for anxiety disorders. You do need both. I also suggest that you see a psychiatrist for your medications. As helpful as your PCP may be, he or she does not specialize in mental health disorders. A psychiatrist does. Klonopin prn is a good place to start but I suspect a psychiatrist will have an alternative idea of which medication you should be taking.I’m very glad you wrote. That was an important first step. Now please follow through. With treatment you can continue your project to make a better life for yourself and your little family than your folks were able to make for you.I wish you well.  </s>"

She comes up to me and shows me her top front tooth is bleeding. This isn’t the first time so I’m not concerned by it. [/INST]  Your sister did the wrong thing — at the wrong time — in the wrong way. Her lack of sensitivity to your daughter, the direct physical invasion, and the timing of the circumstances has caused your daughter to be upset and embarrassed, you and your husband to feel alienated, and her own husband to be ashamed. Regardless of her intention, the net result is that she upset everyone. Her self-righteous reaction doesn’t leave much room for healing. When someone fails to acknowledge their actions hurt other people, there isn’t much opportunity to rebuild.Give it some time. I would talk privately with her after a while and explain that you want to have a relationship with her, and would like her to understand how this hurt you. I would offer her a dialogue from time-to-time to give her an opportunity. There were SO many other ways she could have handled this — but chose not to. If she isn’t willing to see her actions as being hurtful, then you may have to remain guarded about your involvement. If she only invests in justifying herself then she will rationalize doing it, or something equally inappropriate, again.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"

You had a successful experience with therapy before. Why not give it another round? Once you’ve made a relationship with a therapist, you have a resource you can return to whenever you need to. She will know your story up to when you left so you don’t have to start completely over. Therapy can help you sort out how best to handle your situation. You could also invite your mom to join you so the two of you could work on your relationship.While you wait for an appointment, please remember this: Someone can only fight if someone else fights back. You have some responsibility – and some power – in this situation. Just because someone invites you to a fight doesn’t mean you have to participate. You could just say something like, “I’m sorry you feel that way” as gently and respectfully as possible, promise to try to do better (there’s always room for us to do better) and go about your business.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, I have been dealing with this problem, I’m pretty worried I might be a Pedophile, I am 16 and shouldn’t really be worrying about this I feel like but it keeps eating at me, I’ve never had the desire to touch a kid, and when I did it was before I hit puberty (as a kid myself) when I was 14 I was in a relationship with someone a little older than me (she would have been around 15) I honestly felt like I was in love with this person, shortly after that we broke up and it honestly emotionally destroyed me for a while, I’ve been diagnosed with Chronic Depression and Social Anxiety, my mother is pretty certain I have OCD just by the way I talk about things. My councilor says I am just suffering from intrusive thoughts, when I was around 12 – 13 and I would masturbate images of children would pop up in my head (I honestly didn’t think much of this because I was pretty confident I wasn’t a pedo) my first bad cycle of intrusive thoughts were HOCD thoughts, I honestly found myself being aroused my men when I purposefully thought about it to test myself, then it switched to thoughts of wanting to kill my mother, feel urges when I’d see a knife just typical things like that, but now its switched to thinking about kids, I can’t tell if I like it or not and it sometimes causes,I wouldn’t say pure anxiety but doubts and confusion, I honestly feel like I dislike it, I am currently talking to a female I think I like, she is 17 I can get erections thinking about her but I feel like it doesn’t feel as good or as strong, I felt relieved when I found out I don’t get hard over kids, but then I purposefully thought about it and started having a reaction to it, it honestly made me feel pretty bad, I would rather kill myself than be a pedo, also I don’t know if this information helps but I’m on an antidepressant called Mirtazapine which is an SSRI, could this be a problem too as I started having these bad thoughts around the time I started taking them, am I POCD or do I have Paraphilia. Please help! (From Australia) [/INST] Thank you for being so open, brave and vulnerable by sharing these details with us. There are several overlapping pieces of information and I’d like to sort them through for clarity.The first is a distinction between being a pedophile and Pedophilia OCD, or POCD. The POCD is when there are unwanted harmful or sexual thoughts about children. What is important about this differential diagnosis is that with POCD there is no desire to harm a child, but the intrusive thought plague the sufferer. The result is often panic, anguish, shame and depression. In other words the intrusive thoughts are repulsive and not something the person wants to act on.Pedophilia is termed pedophilic disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5.) To be classified as a pedophile according to the DSM you would need to be at least 16 years old, at least five years older than the child, and the sexual urges and fantasies have either been acted on or caused actual interpersonal difficulty or severe distress because of the intense, recurring urges. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) “… a sustained, focused, and intense pattern of sexual arousal—as manifested by persistent sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges, or behaviours—involving pre-pubertal children. In addition, in order for Pedophilic Disorder to be diagnosed, the individual must have acted on these thoughts, fantasies or urges or be markedly distressed by them. This diagnosis does not apply to sexual behaviours among pre- or post-pubertal children with peers who are close in age.”I am elaborating on the definitions because typically acting on the thoughts or severe stress surrounding those specific thoughts are part of the diagnostic profile from either the DSM or the ICD-11. For more information please read here.The HOCD, Homosexual Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and then the shift to a type of “Harm OCD” when seeing a knife, may actually be helpful in understanding what’s happening, and perhaps some clues as to what type of therapy may work.You’ve not acted on your thoughts with children and they frighten you. You have also displayed two other forms of intrusive thought patterns in addition to the children with both the HOCD and the Harm OCD. More than this, you have purposefully engaged in different thoughts to test their effect. If you can change your thinking to increase thoughts about these urges it means you have some degree of control over them. This is the most important thing about what you’ve said. You are experimenting and controlling these thoughts to test them out.  This implies that Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) may be a very effective treatment for OCD intrusive thoughts as it aims to give you control over them, which you already appear to have at some level. You can learn more about this and other styles of therapy here.Finally, according to authoritative sources, the Mirtazapine typically doesn’t include the side effect of intrusive sexual thoughts.My encouragement is to find a therapist very familiar with OCD who uses CBT for treatment and get a consultation to confirm some of the ideas presented here.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Over the past 30 years, my parents (and particularly my mother) have never been satisfied with the level of effort I expend toward family relationships. As a child I was accused of ignoring and not liking my sister, and forced to seek her out to apologize for hurting her feelings. My sister, by the way, used to pin me to the ground and pull hair out of my head and painfully tickle and pinch me when I was young. Now she is divorced. She has always been a kind yet very negative, sarcastic person with a mean streak. I find being around her very tiring. [/INST]  It is time to detach from your family emotionally by changing your expectations. You seem to have a very good handle on how each member of your family has treated you — and their lack of reciprocity. This doesn’t mean you need to push away — it means to unhook from needing anything from them while having compassion. In 12-step programs they talk of detaching with love. But this strategy will work with anyone whose personality pattern and interactions are self-absorbed.Since no one in your family is extending themselves in a real way to make a meaningful connection — your one-way effort will continue drain your energy and enthusiasm. They do not resond with anything that fills you up. I would not announce this new approach of detachment, but rather limit your time, exposure, and expectations from them. This will leave you with more emotional resources to make deeper connections with those who can reciprocate — your wife, children, and friends.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My grandmother was schizophrenic. Sometimes I wonder if I could be mildly schizophrenic. When I was 13, after receiving a OUIJA board, I became convinced, for about a year, that I could use the OUIJA board just by imagining it. Then I thought the spirit was communicating with me by making me spell things out in sign language, or write things. I became very frightened about this, to the point of having nightmares and feeling sick, and I would pray for the “spirit” to leave my body. Strangely, it eventually went away and I forgot about it. For many years I believed this really did happen. When I grew up I realized it could not have been true. [/INST]  Though I cannot know with certainty, your symptoms do not seem indicative of schizophrenia. Many people who own a Ouija board believe that they are interacting with spirits through the Ouija board. That is especially true among children and adolescents.The other symptoms that you are concerned about occur when you are on the verge of sleep. Many people report having unusual sensory experiences during that time. Your experiences are more likely related to your drowsiness than being symptoms of schizophrenia.It is important to know that because your grandmother had schizophrenia, it does not mean that you will develop the condition. The fact that your grandmother had schizophrenia increases the likelihood that someone in your family will develop it but that risk is relatively slight. Many scientists believe that schizophrenia has a strong genetic component but there is no known singular cause of schizophrenia. Many complex factors may be involved.If you continue to be concerned about having schizophrenia, it may bring you peace of mind to be evaluated by a mental health professional. The advantage of meeting with a mental health professional is that he or she can review your concerns, gather a detailed psychosocial history and make a determination, with relative certainty, whether or not you have schizophrenia. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: My brother and I grew up with a narcissistic mother. I have read online that this causes a lack of nurturance. As a result when I was 6, 7, 8 my brother and I had sexual relations. I don’t remember much, but it started out with my brother making me give him oral sex until eventually I demanded it in return and he would most of the time. On one occasion, my brother and his friend told me we were playing “doctor” in which I gave them both oral sex without anything in return. My brother also tried to get me to penetrate him, but I refused. As far as I remember he didn’t penetrate me, but I do remember him getting fairly close. A good friend of mine at the time told me something recently that I do not remember in which he said he watched my brother proceed to have anal sex with me. I am very confused as to whether this would be considered sexual abuse or not since he would give me oral sex in return sometimes. I’m still very ashamed of this and hurt deeply by it, and it has been giving me much trouble lately so please respond quickly. [/INST]  You didn’t mention how far apart in age you and your brother are. Many kids who are close to the same age explore sex with each other. They keep it up for a time because it feels good. Sometimes kids’ needs for physical affection aren’t filled. If you were getting very little from your parents, being sexual with your brother may have been especially important to the two of you as it was a way to be touched and to touch. If, however, you brother is older and was in a position of power or authority over you, then what you describe would be termed abusive. The report from your friend is disturbing and supports that possibility.I think you need to sort this out with a therapist. You had legitimate needs as a kid. You have many questions now. Some work with a therapist will give you perspective and a way to put the shame and self-blame behind you. There is no need to carry the hurt and troubling feelings into your future.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am concerned because for the past few months, I feel as if I just don’t sleep what I should. I know that this is a general problem within society, but I feel something is genuinely wrong. Each night I go to bed, either early or late because I am with friends or working on school work or working and on those nights I roughly get about 3 to 4 hours of sleep, which of course is on my own doing, and then during the next day I may take a 2 to 3 hour nap and then the next night I will have trouble sleeping, which I believe is put on by the naps during the day, but I don’t always take naps. And even when I don’t hang out with friends or school and what not, and I go to bed at a decent time, I find myself consistently waking up in the middle of the night and staying up researching colleges because I have not been happy with my overall choice in schooling. [/INST]  Yes, you should be concerned. Sleep deprivation can lead to illness and bad decisions. At 19, you need 6 to 8 hours of restorative sleep every night to be at your best. But from what you told me, it makes sense that sleep aids aren’t helping. Your sleeplessness seems to be a symptom of a larger problem. You are focusing on the sleep. I’m thinking you should be focusing on what it is that is making you so anxious about your future, your schooling, and your choices. You aren’t able to shut down your worries at night so of course you can’t sleep.I suggest you get at the root cause of your sleep problems directly. Most colleges have a career center. Please make an appointment to talk to a counselor there about your school and career choices. If there isn’t a career center, consider whether there is another resource on campus such as a counseling center or pastoral counselor. Many teachers are also happy to talk to an interested student. You might also find this article helpful.Meanwhile, there are some things you can do about sleep. Get regular in your sleep habits. Go to bed at the same time every night. Do not let yourself take naps. Eliminate caffeine. Read and study somewhere other than in your bed. You want bed to be associated with sleep. If you can’t sleep, don’t toss and turn. It only makes a person more anxious. Instead, get up and write down your thoughts and feelings. Then go back to bed.I think a combination of dealing with your worries directly and taking charge of your sleep hours will help.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am married for a year and a half, I found out that my husband is cheating on me like 3 months ago, recently also I discovered that he is cheating on me before we got married like for four years and not with one girl. I don’t know how he can manage all of them at the same time none of us knows this my second marriage am shocked he does not know that I found out about anything, I feel like I lost myself, I don’t want to think about him I want to think about myself I lost myself for a long time. I can’t even stop thing if he is texting them , seeing them. Even in at sex I can’t imagine myself with him I started to make any excuse to not do it. [/INST]  I appreciate the strong feelings that go along with this level of betrayal. It is hard to overcome. Unfortunately if his acts of betrayal are as ingrained as you say they are, then the opportunity for the two of you to recover as a couple is very problematic. A betrayal in a marriage is one of the more difficult situations to deal with. If his infidelity preceded the marriage by several years, it means he’s used to lying and betraying you. I cannot imagine it is possible to trust him in the future — there is too little in your relationship to build on.While it is sad and unfortunate that he is this way, it is not something that you can avoid dealing with. While I almost always suggest couples counseling as a vehicle for healing, in this instance I recommend you use it as a way to end the relationship. Have a therapist present when you inform him of what you know. This will help with you transitioning out of the marriage.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Canada: My husband lied to me years ago and I just found out I have been married for about 4 years but together for 14. As I was browsing on our desktop computer looking for some old photos over the weekend I discovered photos from a work trip my husband went on about 8 years ago. These photos contained him and another women (selfies, dinner together and shopping). I was and am completely furious. I recall right after that trip as I saw some other photos of him with the exotic car he had rented and asked who took the pictures. He told me at that time he got people off the street to take the photos and I naively believed him. [/INST] Please slow down. You’ve had 14 years together. For you to be so devastated suggests to me that there may be other red flags you’ve been ignoring. Another possibility is that you are way over-reacting. Having some fun while on a work trip isn’t necessarily cheating. It may be that it’s just as he says. On the other hand, maybe he was having doubts about your relationship at the time and was trying out what it would be like with someone else. If so, he got his answer. He stayed with you and married you.The question for you, then, is whether the last 8 years including 4 in a committed marriage outweighs a possibly dishonest weekend. A situation like this can deepen or break an otherwise good relationship.It depends entirely on what the two of you do next. If you can talk about it openly, honestly and calmly, you may learn important things about each other and your relationship. If your discussion degenerates into accusations, defensiveness and counter accusations, it can result in a very deep wedge developing between you. I hope the two of you can take a big step back from the emotional first responses and instead talk seriously with each other about what your 14 years mean to you and what to do now.He can’t undo the weekend. But he can apologize. And both of you can reaffirm the value of a shared life of 14 years. If there are problems in the relationship the two of you have been ignoring, this is the opportunity to work on them. If you find that you are unable to do that on your own, I hope you will make an appointment with a couples counselor for some guidance.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I want to go back to my ex-husband from whom I’ve been divorced for over three years because of his violence. Before the divorce he ended up in jail for almost a year for domestic abuse. Since his release he says he’s changed. He’s gone to a local community mental health facility, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, PTSD, and adult ADHD. He’s on medication and collecting social security disability and has a payee handle his finances. I see him on a regular basis and realize we still love each other, although it’s hard to believe that he loved me when he was abusive, which I now attribute to mental illness. The problem is threefold: [/INST]  It sounds to me like you already have a reasonable solution. You don’t have to marry in order to be friends and lovers. You have more to lose than to gain by giving in to his demands to somehow prove to him that you are there for him. What concerns me most is that he asserts he is the only one who truly loves you. These are the words of a potential abuser. Love isn’t about isolating someone. It’s not about making someone feel they can’t be loved by others. Real love is generous and kind. I hope you don’t believe that he’s the only one who cares. Your sons certainly love you and are protective of you when you aren’t protective of yourself. It’s one thing to “accept” him as he is. It’s another to cave in to unreasonable and selfish demands. I hope you will trust your intuition.I wish you well.  </s>"

"<s>[INST] From the U.S: I am married and living with 6 step kids ranging in age from 5-18. [/INST]  Please understand that the kids probably don’t hate you as a person. They hate the disruption in their lives, and their mother has made you the scapegoat. The kids are in a terrible position. They know their mother is angry. They may think that if they show affection for you, their mother will reject them.You don’t mention where your husband is in all this. You need his help. You can’t change their mother. But you and their father can sit down with the kids and tell them that you understand the position they are in and wish you could make it different. Don’t trash their mom. Just remind them that there are good, adult reasons why their parents divorced that don’t involve them. Emphasize that their dad didn’t divorce them and that the two of you are doing the best you can to make a good life for everyone. You can make it clear that you have no intention of trying to replace their mom but that you all could find a way for you to be an adult friend.Let their dad take the lead in this conversation. The kids need to hear from him that he loves them and respects their feelings but that they still have to treat you with respect. They don’t have to love you, but they do have to be civil. Then he has to follow through. If the kids treat you badly, he needs to remind them that it’s simply not okay to make you into the bad guy. Meanwhile, you need to acknowledge their feelings but not get upset by them. You can say something like, “I know this is hard for you but treating me badly isn’t going to help the situation. Let’s figure out how to be friendly even if we can’t be friends.” Then do what you can to change the subject. If they won’t let you, leave the room if you can, say something like, “I can see that you are too upset to listen so I’m going to take a time out. Let me know if there’s a time you want to talk about things more calmly.”Step parenting is one of the hardest jobs in the world. I applaud you for your efforts. Your parenting is working with your birth-kids so you are obviously doing something right. Hopefully you and your husband can get on the same page and pull his other kids into your family.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in Serbia: My psychological state was never quite alright ever since I entered puberty it seems. It first all started with a case of mild depression as a result of having some existential dilemmas and coming face to face with the uglier face of this world for the first time. Slowly but surely this feeling of dread started creeping into me, and I completely shut myself of from the rest of the world somewhere at the age of 13, spending my days in the darkness of my room along with a book. [/INST]  I understand why you are frightened. I don’t understand how it is that you’ve been able to isolate yourself so severely since you were 13. You didn’t mention what your parents have done or not done about your behavior. I hope you are keeping them informed of your feelings and that they can be supportive and take the needed steps to get you the help you deserve.Without more information, I have no way to determine if what you are experiencing is the result of a sleep disorder (which I suspect is at least part of the problem), social anxiety, depression or some other problem. I do know that you can’t handle the situation by yourself. You need help. You need a proper evaluation of your sleep habits, your diet, your general physical health and your mental state.The place to start is with your regular primary doctor. I believe that Serbia has been working on reforming mental health services for almost 20 years. Your doctor will be able to refer you to the appropriate professionals.Adolescence is tough for a lot of young people. You are certainly not alone in withdrawing into your room. But feelings such as you describe should not be ignored or untreated.You’ve already lived with this distress for 3 years. There is no need to continue feeling so terrible and so afraid.

"<s>[INST] Two and a half years ago I started having bad depression and severe, obscure paranoia. [/INST]  You stated that this change occurred two and half years ago. The question becomes what happened two and half years ago? Perhaps it was an event or a noteworthy change in your life. The types of symptoms you have described usually don’t happen out of the blue. There is a physical or psychological cause and that must be determined.Knowing the source of your symptoms is the first step in your treatment. There’s nothing to fear about therapists. They like to help people. For many, it is the sole reason why they choose to work as a professional. Give them a chance to help you.Relatedly, you worry that therapists are going to use your “weakness against you” but what would this be? I am a therapist and I have detected nothing in your letter that indicates a weakness. That is likely something you fear to be true and not something that is true. You might believe in those misguided ideas, that unfortunately exist in our culture, about seeking help. There’s great value and wisdom in seeking help from professionals who are trained to know how to solve life problems. You should give it a try.I would strongly encourage you to continue therapy if you have started and to try it if you have not, for all the reasons that I have described above. Your symptoms are treatable. if you are open to treatment, but they most likely will continue if you ignore them. Contact emergency services if you cannot keep yourself safe. They will protect you.

"<s>[INST] I’m always depressed when I’m not around my ex. because he’s the only one who really gets me and knows me and really listens when I talk. When he isn’t around I have no one to talk to so I start thinking that everyone(my ex, my son, everyone) is better off without me. I never leave my bed or my house very much(online schooling). I wake up all night and I never wanna get up in the mornings. I hate the thought of people not wanting me around. I cry all the time! I hate myself a lot/most of the time. The only time I leave my house is family events or my ex convinces me to go somewhere with him. I’m always in pain unless I’m venting to my ex. I mean emotional and physical. I just ache all over. I want to get better and need to for my son and ex(we might get back together later on and he’s my rock and I’m his and if I’m sick I can’t be there for him like I’d like). My ex is the only one that I know who knows about me thinking I’m sick because I don’t want to go to the doctors and have them put me on meds or something. Am I clinically depressed? Should I ask my mom to take me to the doctor to get help or am I fine? I need to know!! [/INST]  An in-person interview, with a trained diagnostician, would provide the most accurate diagnosis but depression may be a realistic possibility. According to your letter, your symptoms include: a desire to isolate, physical and emotional pain, low self-esteem, and the consistent urge to cry. Those are common signs of depression.Your symptoms are interfering with your life and they should be treated. To answer your question directly, yes, you should ask your mother to take you to a doctor. Being evaluated by a doctor does not mean that you will have to take medication. Many people who are receiving treatment for depression don’t take medication. Instead, they undergo counseling. With the right therapist, counseling is an effective treatment modality.What are your next steps? Speak to your mother. Tell her about your symptoms. Ask her if she will schedule an appointment for you with either a primary care physician (PCP) or a local therapist. Consider seeing your PCP first to rule out possible medical problems. The PCP can then refer you to a therapist. If you choose not to see a PCP, the “find help” tab, at the top of this page, can help you to locate a therapist in your community.The best way to find the right therapist is to call at least four or five and ask them various questions, including:Choose the therapist who you feel most comfortable with and schedule an appointment.

Now this would be just odd if it wasn’t for the fact that I also have scary but enjoyable thoughts. I see people and want to hurt them really bad no matter who it is. I love the feel and smell of blood and enjoy having it around me. I’ve killed small creatures and I can’t fully remember doing it except knowing their dead.

"<s>[INST] From Panama: It has been going for a while now, but I realized about a couple of weeks ago. It seems like a really bad habit, but now I’m not sure if it’s just a habit. I have a lot of interests. I like researching and finding out what I like, but that also happens to be a bad thing since when I find an interest and I decide to pursue it, after little time, I give up on it. I don’t know why, but I always seem to do it. It’s like I lose interest, or whatever motivation I had in the first place. For example, a couple of weeks ago I had decided to write a book. I’ve always loved writing and reading, even when I was younger. Reading is certainly an addiction, while writing fills me with satisfaction. So I started creating the plot and organizing the story, because I wanted to do it perfectly. I started making summaries per chapter so that when I actually start to write, I know what goes on in the chapter. I was so pumped about it. I felt like this time, I was going to do it right. Until a few days ago. The book was just by the half. I stopped logging in my computer. I stopped looking for words. I stopped having interest. I simply stopped wanting to write. And I know that it’s not writers block, because I knew what I had to write, I just didn’t want to. And I’m so annoyed about it, because I was telling myself at the beginning: “Don’t worry, you’ll totally make it through the end this time.” And once again, I’ve failed to complete it. And not just in writing, I also quit tap dancing, piano lessons, TV shows, you name it. And I’m disgusted by this because I want to finish stuff, but then I don’t. I’ve never been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorders, but I’m pretty certain I have them. I’ve never checked myself because my parents have enough troubles on their own. I have also insulin resistance and tachycardia (they are aware), so I don’t want to trouble them with something as big as depression and anxiety that may just be all up in my head and possibly not be true. I just keep everything inside, and wait until it all goes away. Please help me. [/INST]   I want to point something out. The email you’ve sent to us had a beginning, middle, and end. You planned something, sat down to do it, and completed it. The key is in finding something that matches your readiness for engagement. The thing you may want to do to get yourself ready for longer and more involved goals is to first pick smaller more manageable goals. Start the process of bringing smaller ideas to fruition and then move to bigger ones.The other thing is to learn how to break larger goals into smaller ones. What you’ve done with your book idea is fantastic. You have an outline and have begun writing. Longer term goals require a different pace — a sprint is different than a marathon.Experiment with shorter goals so you can feel like you have achieved something. Here is a psychcentral blog on the subject that might help.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I just want to get this off my chest, and I truly don’t know if I’ll ever get the answer I want to hear. My entire life, I never felt I belonged in the world… I don’t see the value of any of the frivolous, uhg. My family doesn’t understand me and labels me before even trying to. God has always been a center in my family’s life, but never felt the faith thrust upon me. Every year of school was the same; I was the shy introvert with few friends that still, to this day, don’t know me that well. I constantly mask myself and only show people what they want to see (a trait developed from bullying and fear). Over time, I became addicted to removing myself from my skin in any way possible, I thank God that it hasn’t gotten bad enough to turn to anything harmful. I hate being — well — me, but this shell must still be maintained. For years I put the blame on everyone else and dug myself in a hole my first year of college. For a while I tried to change the way I thought, but never could change the negativity the oozed from from me. I am always told — and try to convince myself — that I am the change I wish to see in the world, but lost passion and can’t find my purpose. I just don’t know if I’ll ever fit in this world, and figure out what about me makes it so impossible! [/INST]  Just because you haven’t found your purpose in life does not mean that you’ll never find it. At 19 years old, you are only beginning your exploration. You only recently became an adult. In fact, recent research suggests that the brain isn’t fully developed until the age of 25. You are still a work in progress.You might feel relieved to know that many people feel the way you do at your age. Developmentally, it is the time when people are beginning to discover their own wants, needs and desires. They are breaking away from their parents and becoming independent. It can be quite a turbulent time.You might benefit from counseling. As you said, you have tried to correct your own thinking and it’s a struggle. Counseling is the process of learning how to make those changes in a systematic and healthy way. A therapist could serve as a supportive and objective coach for you during this process.If you’re open to counseling, consider a therapist who specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy. It’s an effective treatment for the types of problems you have described.In the meantime, you might want to try new experiences in an attempt to find your “passion and purpose.” One idea is volunteering. Viktor Frankl, author of Man’s Search for Meaning, a great book about how to find meaning in one’s life, suggested that volunteering and helping others can be transformative. It can bring new meaning into one’s life. I hope this helps. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a teen in the U.S.: I have a “habit” of picking at my face. I’ve tried to stop, but the thing is I don’t even realize when I’m doing it. I don’t know why I do it or how it even started. [/INST]  I’m so glad you wrote. It takes courage to confront a problem when you feel so much shame about it.I want you to know you are not alone. I’ve heard similar stories many times before. Everyone who falls into skin-picking as a habit for “self-improvement” wants to stop and feels that they can’t. But there is treatment and you can learn to control the urge.Skin picking is generally a form of Body Dysmorphic Disorder. Dr. Sabine Wilhelm and her team at the Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) Clinic & Research Unit at the Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School have dedicated years of research in how best to treat it. A combination of medication, cognitive behavior therapy and support will help you do what you can’t do for yourself. I suggest you go to their website to learn information and to use their therapist locator to find a therapist who specializes in the problem.Please follow through. The longer you delay getting treatment, the more damaged your skin will be — and the more your self-esteem will suffer. You deserve the good help and support that a therapist can provide.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m 20 years old and I’ve been with my boyfriend for 5 years. We love each other very much and I’m very happy with him. He completes me. The problem is that my parents are against this relationship because he is not in college, he is a football player. They think that if I stay with him I won’t have a good life because after his football career he won’t be able to find a well-paid job without college education. [/INST]  Sometimes out of love parents think they are helping when they are doing the worst thing possible. Your parents only want the best for you, but they are going about it in the wrong way. You are a 20-year-old woman and they are treating you as if you’re half that age.It is time for you to talk with your parents about their conversations about your boyfriend. Explain to them that what they are doing isn’t making you like your boyfriend less, but actually making you feel more distant from them. Explain that just because they think he isn’t right for you doesn’t change how you feel about him, it only makes you wish they understood your needs better. Finally help them understand that you know the same things about him they do, and that you are willing to make the choice knowing who he is–and who he is not.I do not think this is easy. I think the process of growing up in general is difficult. Part of what has to happen when you individuate is to let the people who love you know you appreciate their help and their advice and you will consider it, but that in the end they have raised a strong independent woman and you will be making your own decision.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Four months ago I was diagnosed with depression by my family’s doctor. I started taking antidepressants but I they were making me feel woozy and restless so I asked to stop taking them and just continuing with regular visits to a psichologist to see how I was holding up. The thing is my family, especially my mom is always criticizing my life and my choices… I never really cared before but now it’s really starting to affect me. I’m really scared to what I might do if my family keeps this non-supportive attitude… My psichologist says that if they are hurting me I should stop spending time with them… But we are still family… I can’t just cut the connection… Is there any way I can make my family understand what I’m going through? Because every time I try to explain to my mom that she’s hurting me, she just keeps telling me that I’m too soft and need to toughen up if I want to make it in this world… [/INST] I agree with your psychologist. If they are hurting you, then you should spend less time (or no time) with them. I understand that they are your family but that is no excuse. Just because they are your family, doesn’t mean that you should tolerate abuse. Blood is not always thicker than water.You wrote that you tried explaining your situation to your mother and it has no impact on her. You can continue that approach but it will likely be wasted effort. It’s important to realize that you can’t change your mother. She is who she is. It is up to you to accept that reality and to modify your behavior in accordance with how she treats you. You should never tolerate abuse from anyone. That can be a difficult lesson to learn, especially when it comes to family.You mentioned that your “mom is making you feel bad about yourself.” No one can make you feel anything. Your feelings originate inside you. They are your feelings. Your mother’s words may be impactful but that’s only because you have allowed her to have that type of power over you.It’s good that you’re in counseling. It is where you should be. Hopefully, it will help you to accept the truth about your mother and adapt accordingly. Obviously, it would be better if your mother treated you kindly but that is not your situation. You have to deal with the truth, no matter how unpleasant it is. Once you accept the truth and adapt your behavior accordingly, your mental health will likely improve. Good luck with your continued efforts. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Egypt: I had a relation with a younger guy. For the first few weeks, everything was wonderful when we were meeting over weekends. We shared many thoughts and memories as well and we seemed to be nice and supporting each others. We also had a strong attraction and we ended up almost living together. [/INST]  I don’t think this relationship destroyed your self-esteem. I think it was a weak self-esteem that got you into this mess. This man treated you terribly but you continued to be involved with him. You even gave him money and good career advice in spite of the disrespect. You deserve far better treatment than this. In hindsight, you should have dumped him the first time he came on to your friend. This man isn’t worth your pain.So let’s get back to your self-esteem. The key to building a strong self-esteem is being active in making the world a better place. When we do things that matter, we like ourselves more. When we like ourselves, we don’t accept poor treatment. We look for other people who are also engaged in doing positive things and who treat us (and who expect to be treated) with the respect we’ve earned.The relationship was a huge mistake, it’s true. But we all make some mistakes in life. What’s important is what we learn from them. I hope you’ve learned to look beyond age and some good times when deciding if a man is right for you. You also need to look at what he is doing with his life and how he is treating other people. Further, I hope you are doing the kinds of things that make you feel good about yourself and worthy of other people’s love and respect. It’s only by doing so that you will feel good about yourself again and worthy of good treatment.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My half brother and i were raised separately and told he was my uncle not my brother cuz our grandma adopted him. our relationship became extremely inappropriate when he was 14 and i was 8, he raped me, not in a malicious way but still. i forgave him. grandma didnt let him have friends, he was over weight, everyone but me made fun of him, he had it rough. our mother didnt raise either of us, i was raised by my great aunt. we found out 3 years later that we were siblings. he went to prison shortly thereafter on unrelated charges for almost 20 years. now he is out and says he is in love with me, that he is addicted to me, that the happiest he has ever been was the incident in the past. i know he is still shaky from being in prison for so long and still adjusting to the outside world and i dont want to make anything more difficult on him. i am in a relationship, one i have been in for over 10 years and i hope to marry my boyfriend someday but even if i were single i would not be interested in my brother. thats not to say i didnt have confusing feelings of my own at some point but he is my brother. i want to help him but he creeps me out sometimes, and says things that i dont know how to respond to. he obsessively calls me or texts me daily. what should i do? what can i do? [/INST]  Your brother’s attraction to you is anything but normal. The fact that his fondest memories stem from having raped you suggests a high level of mental instability. Rape is not only immoral, but it’s a crime. In some states, if you reported his rape to the authorities, he could still be prosecuted.You want to help your brother, but you are not a mental health professional. You can’t help him. He needs professional help. The best way to help him is to suggest that he seek professional help.It’s also not your obligation to help your brother. He is an adult man. He is not intellectually disabled or otherwise incapable of helping himself. Having spent 20 years in prison means that he might have a parole or probation officer who can assist him in seeking professional help. Suggest that he contact his probation or parole officer for assistance. If he is unwilling to seek help, consider reporting his behavior to his probation or parole officer.Finally, the tone of your letter suggests that you want to protect your brother but it’s important to put this problem in perspective. There’s nothing healthy about your brother’s behavior or his desires. You should do everything in your power to keep your distance. Call the authorities if he does not stop harassing you. Obviously you do not want your brother in legal trouble but his obsessive calling and texting is concerning and might even constitute stalking.You have to do what is necessary to protect yourself from a person who has demonstrated his inability to control his impulses and who has a history of violence. Do not discount his past behavior just because he is your brother and you feel bad. Though there are exceptions, past behavior can be predictive of future behavior. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My parents enjoy drinking every night which is not a problem, except that my mom changes. She becomes mean and wild. She had to get surgery once and she was intoxicated where she said when she wakes up she hopes she never see’s me agin. Another incident was when she told me all her problems started once I was born. She is constantly hurting me and this has been going oon for at least past five months.I hate smokers because the smell makes me start to gag and she smoked in the house and in my car one day. It seems like she never cares about me anymore. If I talk to her about how I feel she changes for about two day before she goes back to her ways. Im so tired of having such a stressful home life. It honestly really hurts and compared to other people this may not be like a big deal but it is getting harder to cope. I try and stay positive and say how this is a good lesson because I know how not to act and I will not ever hurt my children like this. I just wish she would realize how much she is hurting me by being basically a coma for the past five years of my life. She was here but not really and she would never remember anything the next day. I feel like i am never good enough and if i was she would not act like this and want to escape her life. Thanks! [/INST]  I’m sorry about what you’re experiencing. In the state of New York, your parents’ behavior would constitute a form of abuse, reportable to child protective services. It is estimated that the majority of cases of child abuse in New York City involve some form of substance abuse. In such cases, the caregivers are more focused on using the substances than attending to the emotional and physical needs of their children. That seems to be what is happening to you.It is important that you do not take your mother’s behavior personally (i.e. “I feel like I am never good enough and if I was she would not act like this and want to escape her life.”). Her behavior is not a reflection upon you. It has nothing to do with you. She has psychological problems that are motivating her to drink. It is not your fault. You are in no way to blame for your mother’s behavior. You have no control over this situation. It’s up to your mother to receive psychological help to deal with her psychological problems.You seem to be a remarkably resilient young woman. You have a stressful home life, through no fault of your own, and yet you are able to maintain a positive attitude. Your parents are not well but you are doing your best to cope with this unfortunate set of circumstances.My advice is to speak to a guidance counselor or another trusted school faculty member about your parents’ drinking. The school faculty can assist you in accessing the proper psychological help.It’s possible that once the school faculty learns about your situation, they may call child protective services to determine if neglect or abuse is occurring in the home. Obviously, you don’t want your parents to get into trouble; however, their behavior might constitute maltreatment. If so, child protective services would likely mandate your parents to receive treatment for alcohol abuse. It might be necessary to force them to receive the help that they need to improve their quality of life. It would also ultimately improve your quality of life. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve been married 3 months we have been together for 5 years but have been friends since 1996. I love him-he’s hot, caring and good in bed. He wants a family and we are about to buy our first home. He isn’t very affectionate and we never sext or talk dirty. There are times I feel bored and invisible. A few months before getting married I had a bad day at work and received an email from a male colleague asking if I was ok and this led to us lunching together and progressed to us seeing each other outside of work too much and me feeling very confused a month before the wedding. I talked to my partner and I told him we’d flirted and that I was enjoying the affection I felt was lacking with us. He was mature and said he would try harder and temporarily this worked. I got married with a clear conscious and didn’t think about the other guy at all, we had a lovely day and he was very attentive but now its back to old ways and I’ve got close to the work guy again. We have kissed twice since I’ve got married and I’ve told my husband. The guy initiated both kisses and I pulled away. I told him he had not sustained the affection he had promised me and this is why I have sought it elsewhere. I have told the guy it can never happen again and that my future is with my husband and I feel guilty but on a bad day we still flirt. I am worried he is not what he seems and there are lots of messages between us that I hope he has deleted. I have told my partner we have flirted but not the content as I don’t want to hurt him. I don’t fancy this guy, I don’t want to do any of the things we are discussing in the texts either but it continues to happen. I worry my partner will one day learn of the messages-I got him to delete one lot but then it started again.I want to be a good wife but don’t know how to right this. I’ve survived rape and abusive relationships & it’s like I crave attention and drama like I’m on self destruct. I hate myself and my behaviour. Please help. (From Wales) [/INST]  I admire the courage it takes to face this issue head-on and to write us here. I don’t believe you are on self-destruct — but I do thing what you are doing is self defeating. I believe your relationship is at a crisis point and writing your email is a very proactive way of dealing with it.I would highly recommend couple counseling. The flirting is a symptom, not a cause. What I mean by this is that you are not looking toward the other person as a potential marriage partner, but rather the flirting is the result of a weak relationship with your husband. The only work that makes sense is to determine if your marriage has enough power to last.Find a couple counselor and talk about what you need from your husband. Hopefully this will give you both something to work together on. But if the marriage doesn’t have the staying power you’d hoped for — at least you can move on knowing you’ve ended it directly and with integrity. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  My little brother is a very troubled 11 year old. He has had anger issues throughout his life for as long as I can remember. In the past couple of years the issues have become worse, and my baby brother is turning into a tornado of emotions that ride up and down. He was premature at birth, weighing but 1 pound, and I always wondered if his early birth may have had an affect on his mental health. He is just so angry, and I want to help him. He screams at people and lashes out to our family members. My mother is so depressed as she attempts to control him. She has been taking him to a counselor for the past year. He acts “OK” for a while after each session he attends, but if he doesn’t get his way he will cuss and hit and scream. My grandmother lives with my mother and him, and he has even hit her. He hit me in the stomach when I was 8 months pregnant. He is uncontrollable. If you ask him to do something, and he doesn’t want to he will scream, “no!” and march off, or hit you. I just really want some help for him. I love him so much, and I hate seeing him act this. I fear that if he doesn’t receive help soon that he will go down a very troubled path as he gets older, and perhaps end up in jail. [/INST]  Thanks for writing in regarding your little brother. His behavior does sound troubling so you are right to be concerned. Are you able to talk openly with your mother about your concerns for your brother? If not, I suggest that you talk with your mother to express your concerns and to ask how you can be supportive in her efforts to get him help. In the conversation, be sure to acknowledge what she is doing to help your brother.While I can’t say how his premature birth has impacted your brother’s current behavior, I can say that early experiences help shape our development. You may want to inquire as to whether your brother has had a psychological or neuropsychological evaluation, and if not, suggest that to your mother.You can directly help your brother by spending time with him and developing a positive relationship. Participate in activities that he enjoys and listen to him.  You can also help by setting strong boundaries when his behavior is inappropriate or hurtful.Take good care of you and yours!Julie Hanks, LCSWVisit my new PsychCentral blog for therapists: Private Practice Toolbox photo credit: Philippe Put   </s>"
"<s>[INST] My brother just recently told me that he’s thinking of ending his life on his birthday 5 days from now. He says that he’s not depressed, but feels like there is no way for him to be happy living his life. [/INST] Dear Little Sister,First – this is not your fault. Both your “friend” and your brother are playing a deadly game. She seems to be getting off on jerking your brother around. He seems to have an idea that if he threatens to kill himself, she’ll come to her senses and be with him. They both count on you to carry messages. Your brother wants you to tell your friend about his plans so she can come running and convince him to stay alive. Your friend wants you to tell her how she is affecting your brother. (By the way, you would not be putting anything on her shoulders that she didn’t invite there if you were to tell her. ) The whole thing is very complicated and very unfair to you! And dangerous. It’s all high drama but it could backfire terribly. Neither of these people seems very well balanced right now.There are some confidences that are not meant to be kept. Killing self or someone else is at the top of the list. Go immediately to your parents. Show them the whole letter you sent me. They need to take him to be evaluated and perhaps hospitalized. (It might be helpful for them to show your letter to the doctor since you know more details than they do.) If your brother doesn’t meet criteria for hospital admission, your folks need to have him on a 24/7 suicide watch. That means someone stays with him every minute until it is certain that he has worked this crazy infatuation through. The girl and/or her parents should also be called. It’s not her fault that your brother has gotten so worked up by her but I do think she has a moral obligation to stop playing her games.I wish all of you well.Dr. Mariep.s. You might want to think about what kind of person you are hanging around with. A real friend wouldn’t be targeting your brother like this. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My husband retired 3 years ago and he is 77. We have been married for 47 years. It has been a tough marriage not due to the usual reasons like cheating or addictions or sex or any of that. We are financially good, are both healthy. Our kids are settled and we are close to them. I have plenty of outside interests, friends I go out with, I volunteer and I write. [/INST]  Thank you for writing in with your question and I’m sorry you are experiencing these difficulties. In many ways I think you are doing everything right, and obviously some things are working since you and your husband have been together 47 years. It would be unfortunate to see the marriage end after so long, and especially now that you are both retired and should be able to enjoy this phase of your life together.However, your relationship does not sound enjoyable. As much as you have tried to focus on the positive, it sounds like your husband has not met you half way. Relationships are a two way street and if your partner isn’t also trying to make things warm, harmonious and respectful, it’s no wonder you are exhausted.I do disagree with you when you say that boundaries are only for enemies. All human relationships require boundaries in some ways. It really comes down to respecting yourself and your partner. You relate that you respect his boundary by giving him space, but it does not sound like he respects yours if he lectures and shouts at you. This pattern will be difficult to change after all these years, but it’s a good place to start. You can let him know that you want him to speak to you softly and listen to what you have to say, or you will simply leave the conversation. If you do this enough times, he should start to get the point.Divorce is definitely not the only answer, but if he is unwilling to work with you to make things better it may be an option you need to consider. Sometimes mentioning the possibility at least gets the other person’s attention enough that they will begin to work on things. Obviously the two of you would benefit from marital counseling, but you could also try a weekend couple’s retreat, a self-help book (such as one by John Gottman), or having some meetings with your priest or pastor if appropriate.Finally, I have certainly worked with some couples who have decided to stay together but basically live separate lives for the most part. Maintaining the outside interests that you mention would be key in this regard.Whether you decide to stay and work to make things better, stay but find your happiness in other ways, or ultimately make the difficult decision to leave the marriage, I hope that you find the peace you are looking for.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been dealing with my anxiety for years I never knew how to control the stupid mental illness. Til to this day I want to kill people because of my anxiety is being pushed. [/INST] If you truly want help from your therapist, then you have to tell the truth. Think about it. You’ve been withholding important information from her. You never told her about your urge to kill. You have probably never told her about your visiting the deep web or your viewing of the disturbing YouTube channel. You also mentioned your temptation to commit suicide but didn’t necessarily indicate whether or not you’ve told your therapist.It’s difficult to help someone when they’re withholding important facts about what’s wrong. If you don’t tell her the truth, then it will be difficult to help you.I understand your fears but, in all likelihood, you would not be committed to a hospital. It is extremely difficult to be committed. An individual has to pose an imminent and actionable threat to themselves or to others in order to be committed. Thoughts and ideas are often too vague to justify inpatient hospitalization.Until your honest with your therapist, these issues will likely continue but this is easily rectified by telling the truth. She will not be surprised. It’s not something she hasn’t heard before. Therapists are trained to know how to treat these types of issues.You should also stop indulging your negative and harmful urges. Your visits to the dark web, and so forth, are likely making these urges worse but you can change that by doing it less or stopping altogether. These types of behaviors are a sign of someone in significant distress.If you discuss these issues with your therapist, she can help you to make changes. Depression and anxiety are highly treatable conditions but they necessitate you telling the truth.If your urge to kill becomes unbearable or uncontrollable, then contact emergency services. They will protect you from harming yourself or someone else. I hope that you will speak to your therapist and begin to heal from these very treatable conditions. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] At random times of the day -noon or night, there’s never consistency- I will get a ‘flash’ or a ‘clip’ of myself moments before becoming seriously injured or what looks like could only result in premature death, in wherever my current environment is. These clips are intrusive, I never think them up myself, plan them, etc. They just show themselves to me while my eyes are still open. [/INST]  The concussion must be considered as a cause of your symptoms. You did not mention what led to the concussion. Was it a car accident? A slip and fall? Whatever happened that led to the concussion may explain why you subsequently developed anxiety. It may be a coincidence and the concussion and subsequent anxiety are unrelated but without more information, it’s difficult for me to gain insight into the cause.It’s good that you have been recording the picture flashes. That information could help your doctor or a mental health professional determine what is wrong. My recommendation is twofold. First, it’s important to report these flashes to a medical doctor, perhaps the individual who treated your concussion or your primary care physician. If you’re not seeing a primary care physician, then it may be advantageous to consult a neurologist. A neurologist can determine if the flashes are related to the concussion and make treatment recommendations accordingly.Second, I would also recommend that you consult a mental health professional. A therapist could determine a possible diagnosis but more important, provide you with the appropriate treatment for your symptoms. Generally speaking, anxiety seems to be at the heart of these issues but a therapist would gather more information about your symptoms, and your psychosocial history, and provide you with a more specific answer about what might be wrong. I hope this helps. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, I am trying to find the things I should do and the things I shouldn’t do when approaching my husband. He has just been diagnosed with PTSD after years of alcohol and drug abuse. He is a VERY loving man who will suddenly change and push me and his loved ones away. Over the years I have dealt with it by moving completely out of the picture due to the accompanying abuse and thinking it was just an alcohol problem. After his last episode, which left him nearly dead, we have talked in depth and he talked me through the episodes where he just disappears. We made a pact for me to ignor his rejections and just keep ‘kissing him’. When he started sliding this time I managed to get him to a doctor and he was diagnosed with PTSD. But now I’ve lost him again. It is like a Jeckyl and Hyde situation as he cannot remember when he was in the ‘zone’. He only remembers the repercussions. Before, when he used to hit me he would experience huge guilt, recently he has been loosing total trust in me because of the way I have reacted. He has found an ‘enabler’ at the moment who pays for everything and doesn’t trigger his trauma so he is in no danger other than massive increased alcohol consumption and codependency. However last week he was experiencing psychosis and foned me in a frantic state asking for help whilst shouting at me. I seem to be making matters increasingly worse by contacting him. This isnt just a lovers tiff, it is a life threatening situation and I have no support and no indication of what I should do and, more importantly, what I should not do. [/INST]  These are the facts as I understand them: your husband has been diagnosed with PTSD due to his use of alcohol and drug abuse; his alcohol use is not under control; when intoxicated he can become violent and psychotic; you have been advised to keep “kissing him” while he is intoxicated and to ignore his “rejections.”You also wrote that he has an enabler and that he is “in no danger other than massive increased alcohol consumption and codependency…[and] it is a life-threatening situation.”It’s unclear who is the enabler. Are you referring to yourself or someone else?It’s difficult for me to give you specific advice because I would need more information. If I had the opportunity to ask follow-up questions, I would have many.Your husband’s life may be in danger because of his drinking, but I believe that your life might be in greater danger. He is actively, drinking despite being aware of the fact that he can become violent and psychotic while intoxicated. He is dangerous, and he doesn’t seem to care about how his behavior affects others. He continues to drink despite it significantly damaging his life and the lives of those around him.You asked what you should and should not do in this situation. You should not be accepting of your husband’s behavior. You should keep your distance from him until his drinking is under control. You should not “kiss him” until he no longer rejects you — I take that to mean that you should physically kiss him until he stops pushing you away. Such a circumstance puts you in danger of being physically harmed.I do not understand why he was given a diagnosis of PTSD. Given the information you have provided, it would seem not to be indicated, however there may be much more information available to the diagnostician, which would make the diagnosis appropriate.You should ask your husband to seek help. If he’s unwilling, then you should keep your distance. You should seek professional help to assist you in learning how to interact with your husband and how to navigate this dangerous situation. Counseling could help you with this very difficult set of circumstances. I hope I’ve helped. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Through mental health treatment, I’m being told that what’s been my reality for the last 10 years or so is not reality. I don’t really know how to cope with this. It’s making me question literally everything, and I feel completely overwhelmed about learning what’s real and what isn’t. How do I deal with this? [/INST]  The fact that you are changing and seeing things differently because of therapy is generally a healthy thing. That is the outcome of good therapy.You might be confusing reality with opinion. There is only one reality whereas there are endless numbers of opinions. An opinion is a subjective statement about a like or a dislike. For instance, it might be my opinion that chocolate ice cream is better than vanilla ice cream. You might disagree with my opinion and believe that the vanilla ice cream is better than chocolate ice cream.Reality is very different than opinion. There is no such thing as my reality and your reality. There is only one reality. Reality is objective whereas “your reality or my reality” is subjective and falls into the realm of opinion. Reality can be proven and it is based on science and logic.For instance you might decide to pick up a hitchhiker because, in your sincere opinion, the hitchhiker looks like a nice person. If the hitchhiker is in reality a serial killer, you will die because your opinion of reality was wrong. No matter how sure you were, no matter how sincerely and deeply you believed you were right, you were wrong and you will die because your opinion of reality was incorrect.Your opinion doesn’t matter; only reality matters. If your thinking is in line with reality, then you will make fewer mistakes and thus suffer less. That is the essence of Abraham Maslow’s self-actualizing theory.My question to you is this: Are you experiencing a decrease in your symptoms and is your life improving as a result of your therapy? If so, that’s a good thing. That’s the goal of therapy, to improve your life and well-being. If your symptoms are increasing and your life is worsening, that is obviously a problem. If you’re experiencing the former and not the latter, then it would seem like your treatment is working.Regarding how to deal with your “new reality,” accept it for what it is. We must all seek and accept the truth. What is true is real and what is real is true. The more you can see reality the safer and happier you will be.If you would like to write back to ask a more specific question, I could provide you with a more specific answer. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  Me and my girlfriend have been together for around 19 months now but in January we had a rough patch and took a break, the reason for that break was she got Postnatal depression 6 months after our daughter was born and she became very confused about her self and started going out with friends a lot and drinking too which I had no issue with as she had done an amazing job being a mother and she deserved the time to let her hair down, within the times she went out she met a lad that worked at the local bowling alley and they hooked up a few times after and admitted to “Kissing” him whilst we we’re together. During the break we had she admitted that she had slept with the lad on one occasion My reaction wasn’t explosive because we agreed to have a break and that’s her decision to sleep with him yes it hurt me a lot but I couldn’t “Go Crazy” after 2 months apart my girlfriend tells me she wants to get thing back on track, I was so thrilled that she decided this but now after a month of so she has started to go very quiet with me and less talkative, and the issue my Girlfriend has is when she has things on her mind she speaks about them in her sleep, and a few nights ago she was speaking as if she was talking to someone and her word was “I think I have fucked up getting back with Jamie (my name BTW), as I can only think about someone else. I have confronted her but she denies that she likes someone else and that she loves me, this is now making me confused, now earlier this morning (21/04/2011) she spoke in her sleep saying she was thinking a lot about this person and it is really concerning me, my main question is does she want me because she grew up without her father and she wants me there for ours or what. [/INST]  What a difficult place to be in. I think one way of understanding this is that you are both confused about the level of commitment needed to sustain the relationship. It also seems that the two of you may not be able to deal effectively with communicating these truths. If a child were not involved you would be able to deal with this by simply moving on, but the truth is the two of you will have to communicate over your child whether you are together or not.I would strongly suggest a couples counselor because there are a great many unresolved feelings that need to be identified and dealt with. This will help you not only if you decide to stay together, but also if you decide to separate and continue making decisions for your child.If she is unwilling to enter couples therapy I would suggest you begin individual therapy to sort through the issues evoked by all of this.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My family became dysfunctional when I was 13. It took 5 years of my life away from me. Coping during those times was difficult, especially with school. I never told anyone how I was treated at home or what went on, because I was embarrassed. This made me feel lonely. I also had no positive relationship with my family, which only added to my feelings of isolation. The dysfunction altered my personality in noticeable ways. I became introverted, depressed, stressed, angry and irritable. I lacked self-esteem and feared people. I was very fearful of judgment and rejection. Through my adolescence, I used art and writing to survive. My peers eventually labeled me an artist. I worked extraordinarily hard to solidify my skills. I even wanted to pursue a career in the arts or publish a book. Today, I am 19 years old and my family has made changes for the better. But we still don’t recognize or discuss what happened in the past, as if to keep it a secret. Things aren’t perfect, but I do have a relationship with my family now. The dysfunction finally stopped sometime after my high school graduation and when I was hired for my first job. But we do fall back into our old patterns from time to time, without really noticing. My current problem now is not my family, but myself. I have been maturing and growing as a person, which is giving me lots of stress. I have lost a lot of my enthusiasm for art and writing. This is really hurtful, because I feel that I am losing something that I put so much effort and love into. Now, I’m not sure what I want to do for a living. I don’t even know myself anymore. Perhaps the artist persona was only protection from my family. I was hoping that you could help me with this identity crisis. I really want to start college, but haven’t yet because of this issue. My mom is very involved with the church now, which makes me stress over my purpose even more. I worry about being a good person, the meaning of life and spirituality, because I’ve never been that religious. I desperately want to know if I’m doing things right. Another issue I have is my mental health. I still struggle with lingering emotions from the past. I can be stressed, irritated, or depressed from time to time. I really want to get better, because I am tired of hurting. I can hardly focus at my job or communicate with others. Thanks for reading my great big long story. I hope you choose to respond. Your advice will be treasured! [/INST]  Throughout your letter you reference a significant life-changing family incident that occurred five years ago. It was apparently traumatic because it impacted your life in a negative way. However, you have omitted that key piece of information from your letter. Without that information, it is difficult for me to provide you with specific advice.With regard to art and writing, it is possible that you did utilize them as a way to cope with strong emotions. Art and writing, as a creative outlet, may have served as a form of psychological protection. That creative outlet may have prevented the development of serious psychological problems.Art and writing served a psychologically healthy purpose during your tumultuous teenage years but those particular outlets may no longer be necessary as an adult. In other words, the needs that you had during your teenage years are different than the needs you have in your current phase of life. You may like art and writing and still want to engage in those activities but you may no longer feel the “need” to do it. Try not see that change as something negative. It might be evidence of psychological growth and development.As one grows and develops, change is evitable. Change may be frightening and disorienting but it is a necessary aspect of psychological growth.In addition, it’s not uncommon for individuals to write poetry during their teenage years. Few individuals are destined as adults to become poets, yet poetry writing among teenagers is seemingly universal. The point here is that many teenagers engage in some type of creative exercise which they will ultimately abandon as they mature.You could greatly benefit from counseling. Many of the issues that you are struggling with, including traumatic history, confusion about what you want to do with your life, dealing with life transitions and identity development, are the prototypical reasons why many individuals enter counseling. You would be a great candidate for counseling. I would highly recommend it. The find help tab, at the top of this page, can help you to locate a therapist in your community. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi, I usually feel a little paranoid about these forums, but I just want an opinion. I don’t even know where to start. I’ve dealt with self esteem issues for a long time. In high school I was known as the weird girl who ran around and was hyper all the time and got in trouble (I went to school overseas) I’ve had difficulty sleeping for the past 4 years, I’ve lost some weight over the years 125 to 106 then back up to 110. It wasn’t purposely as I was in an emotionally exhausting long distance relationship and it ended up taking its toll on me. I’ve only ever been with 3 guys and all of them seemed crazy, unstable and controlling. I have some paranoid thoughts about people, sometimes I think the 3 best friends that I have don’t like me. I feel an enormous amount of guilt from past decisions and actions I’ve made. Sometimes I feel hyper and happy. But not genuine happiness, just a temporary feeling of self esteem, heart racing, thoughts racing, and wanting to jump around and act weird, or something. I can’t really explain it, and then other times I will feel very irritable and upset, I’ve gotten to a point where I argue with my family and have broken our TV, hit walls, and slammed things. Sometimes I feel annoyed with my friends for no good reason, and they don’t even live near me. I help my father out with his business sometimes, and I had a job at a music store, but I got overwhelmed with talking to people there and keep a quota and would come home crying sometimes. So I lied to my boss and told her I was overwhelmed with school and I had to quit, she was sad and she thought I was a good worker but I didn’t think that I was, the only thing I am good at is school, I am a high achiever, however even when I make a B on a test I feel so depressed, and I’m very self critical about everything. I went to see 2 different counselors and I’d make up excuses to not see them again, however I will be seeing a college counselor soon but I’m scared of letting her know stuff about me because I’m scared of people finding out. [/INST]  Since so many of these symptoms seem to be physical, I will encourage you to have a complete medical examination. Sometimes our body chemistry makeup can be responsible for psychological reactions.At the same time that you’re getting a complete physical, I would encourage you to use the college counseling center . It sounds like you have a very good understanding of patterns that have emerged and the counselors at university are typically very well-versed in helping students cope with the things you’ve mentioned.These two directions – getting a physical and meeting with the counselors at university — are a good way to begin unraveling these issues.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, I am a 17 years old teenager, since I was a little girl I’ve always been fragile and sensitive, and by that I mean extremely sensitive, and I cry for everything and nothing, I cry over ridiculous things and for the stupidest reasons and it seems like I can’t do anything about it, at first I thought just because I was a kid, kids cry a lot, and it will disappear eventually when I grow up, but it never went away, it grew up with me, that resulted me having social anxiety, I don’t like to talk or interact with others, because I constantly have the feeling that they would judge me and that they won’t like me, and I always have the fear of their judgement if they ever saw me crying for no reason, I also avoid social interactions because I’m afraid I would get myself in a situation where I would cry, it’s so easy to get me to cry, all it takes is few hurtful words, or seeing another person crying and I will instantly cry even if I don’t know who is that person, and generally my reaction to anything or any emotion is crying, when I am angry I cry, when I am happy I cry, when I am scared I cry… I tried hundreds of times to resist the urge to cry and stop my tears but every time it was a fail, it seems like no one really understands me, not even my family, I tried to talk about this with my family members, but it was a disaster I ended up crying and my family yelling at me and telling that what I am saying is ridiculous and that I’m weak, I considered seeing a therapist before but my family won’t let me, they think that anyone who goes to the therapist is insane, I tried different ways to avoid any situation that possibly would make me cry, like avoid certain types of movies, sad or not, or any videos that shows heartwarming situations like kind acts, I always try to watch comedy, or anything that makes me laugh, or jokes but the only thing that I can’t do anything about it is my thoughts , sometimes, without realizing it, I would imagine some scenarios, or remember some memories not necessarily sad, and I would instantly cry, at the moment I’m just using temporary solutions that doesn’t solve the problem, it just retards it, is it a mental issue? Would I ever be normal? Is there a way for me to stop crying? Or is it just that I’m weak? (From Algeria) [/INST] This type of crying is typically linked with other things and a one-time trip to a psychologist or psychiatrist for a diagnosis is in order. You’re not weak — you just need some guidance on the underlying cases and a good psychologist or psychiatrist can help with that.

"<s>[INST] I don’t know who I am or whether I’m still depressed. I have been depressed before. In fact, I had the worst episode of it about a year ago. I couldn’t get up, I wanted to stop existing, I didn’t even WANT to get out of bed. The usual symptoms. [/INST]  I appreciate you asking your question. It sounds like it has been an uphill struggle for a while. There are two things I think might help. First, I would get a complete medical exam. Please don’t under estimate this. Many symptoms of depression are the result of medical rather than psychological conditions. I think this is the first step in trying to sort this through.Since you are in college I would highly recommend you talk to the people at the counseling center. They have seen many other young people come through college and are likely to have some concrete suggestions to help you feel better. When you do meet with them I would ask them if you could join a therapy group. Powerful thing about group therapy is that you can’t hide. Your encounter with each person in the group will help you figure out who you are, and who you want to become, Rather quickly.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  It seems like for the last couple of years (or somewhere around that margin) I’ve been having problems with just letting things go or mentally getting over something. For example, yesterday, I was in a book store, walking up to the counter, when I felt something hit my back. I looked down, and it was some kind of children’s rubber toy, and there was a stand near me that it could have fell off of if I bumped into it. However, I didn’t notice any such thing on the stand, and it landed on my back… [/INST]  I agree with you that this is a problem. I would categorize your reaction to the situation you described as inappropriate. It is normal to consider the possibilities of what happened to you in the store. After your analysis of the situation you could not determine what had happened. Given the facts, as you have described them, the only rational conclusion for anyone in that situation would be, they simply don’t know what happened. After they came to that conclusion they would have forgotten about it. You did not forget about it. You could not let it go. It became your primary focus. At first, you considered the possibility of an accident. You quickly abandoned that possibility and fixated on the idea that it was done on purpose. These feelings are paranoid in nature.Paranoid personality disorder is a mental health condition in which an individual is highly distrustful of other people. They suspect that others are out to get them. Their distrust and suspiciousness can sometimes lead to anger. The anger can sometimes lead to violence. If someone believes that others are out to get them or trying to “one up” them, then this can lead an individual to feel angry and to seek revenge. This may be what you are experiencing. Based on your belief that someone had purposefully thrown a toy at you in a bookstore, you thought of plotting a way to seek revenge. If you’d like to read more about this disorder please click here.I would highly recommend evaluation and treatment. I cannot be certain if you have paranoid personality disorder; only an in-person evaluation could accurately determine that or any other diagnosis. I believe it is important that you receive objective feedback about how you are perceiving your life situations. As you mentioned at the end of your letter, this problem is not going away and is becoming worse. It is leading you to other distressful feelings and symptoms, all of which need to be evaluated.Therapy may be difficult for an individual if they have paranoid feelings. I believe that you would benefit from counseling if you were willing to try it. Here is a link to therapists in your area. I wish you well. Thanks for your question. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S: Hi. I have been in a relationship for 4.5 years now with a great guy. He is the guy I want to marry. The thing is that I am not ready for marriage yet and I find myself wanting to live the single life, to experience life before I settle down. My current bf is my first serious relationship and I have nothing to compare it to. I also feel like I am missing out on some life experience because I have spent my 20s with him (we started dating when I was 21). [/INST]  I think you’ve already figured out that it’s only fair to everyone to make a choice, but you don’t like having to do it. Indecision keeps both possibilities alive for you.One of my teachers used to say that two relationships are fewer than one. You are not committed to your boyfriend because you are allowing feelings for the other guy. You aren’t committed to the other guy because you have declared yourself to be in a long term relationship.It would be terribly unfair to your boyfriend for you to marry him under these conditions. You are correct. Unless you settle your feelings, the “what if guy” will keep surfacing in your mind, especially when you inevitably run into the rough spots that every couple runs into over the course of a marriage. Sadly, this almost always guarantees divorce. Instead of working hard on the marriage, a person who goes into a marriage second-guessing often tells herself she made the wrong choice in the first place and leaves.If you remain ambivalent, perhaps you should see a therapist to come to an understanding of what exactly you mean by “not being ready for marriage.” There may be more to this than you think.I wish you well.  </s>"

[/INST]  This is way too big a problem for a 13-year-old to handle on her own. Please think hard about what adult in your life might be able to help your parents understand that you and your family need help. You don’t know how to manage your anger. Your folks don’t know how to manage you. Everyone is getting frustrated and discouraged – so much so you are all ready to give up on each other.You’re clearly a sensitive and caring person. You’re right that what’s needed here is some therapy. I suggest you think about talking to your school guidance counselor, your religious advisor, a trusted teacher, or the parent of a good friend. You will know who your parents just might listen to. Ask that person to help you tell your parents the things you talked about in your letter. When you do talk with your parents, work extra hard not to get angry but rather to express your sadness and pain. Also have on hand some phone numbers for a local mental health clinic.If your parents refuse to get involved with therapy themselves, ask again for help finding someone to talk to. Tell your parents that you aren’t interested in blaming and being angry but that you want to learn how to handle your anger and express your feelings appropriately. Sometimes when one person in a family starts therapy and starts showing some results, other people in the family get interested in doing it too.Meanwhile, live as healthy a life as you can. Get involved with activities where you will meet people who are likely to become good friends. Eat right. Make sure you stay active. Believe it or not, dressing well will also help you feel better about yourself each day. Do these things as a statement that you value yourself – even if some other people don’t. That atttitude will help you attract the kind of friends who can be there for each other.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi, I am a senior in high school in a small town..I have struggled with depression, anxiety, panic, and eating disorders since I was 13 years old. And my family just doesn’t seem to understand what I am going through,they act like its just something that i can automaticly turn off my emotions and be happy but thats not the case. [/INST] What a sad, sad story. It’s hard enough to be struggling with so many inner demons without having to struggle with the family too. All I can guess is that your siblings are angry that you take up a lot of family energy and that maybe your parents feel helpless to help you. Sometimes when people feel angry and helpless, they would rather blame or exclude the person they can’t help than face their own feelings of powerlessness or failure. Whatever the reason, this is a miserable situation all around. No one in this family sounds really happy and you have become the family scapegoat.In order to build up your self-identity, getting yourself in treatment is the first part of the equation. You have far too many troubles for someone who is only in her teens to handle by herself. You’re right. You can’t just switch off your problems. But a therapist could help you learn to manage your feelings and could work with you and your family to change your role in the family.If you are not seeing a therapist, please talk with your family doctor or your school guidance counselor to help you find one. If you are in treatment, I hope you are telling the therapist what you told me. A therapist can only work with what she or he is told.As noted on the Cyber Bulling Research Center’s website, “We have to try to get to a point where our identity isn’t completely wrapped up in how others perceive us. And this is so hard. Most adults haven’t gotten to a good place with this yet. But we know our own feelings and emotions and opinions – we can’t fully trust them. They change all the time. That’s how it is for everybody. And if our identity – who we know we are – is constantly dependent on what other people are saying about us, it is going to be a really rough life. You won’t ever fully “own” who you are. You’ll be at the mercy of catering to the thoughts and feelings and opinions and pressures and demands of others. And this is an awful way to live. You have got to get your identity from something stable. Something unchanging. Something that can tell you who you are, where you can believe it and be forever sure about it. And then, when you can get that into your heart, fully and truly, you can live your life out of it. And then life honestly becomes so much better.”I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My ex boyfriend and I had been together for 7 years. We met during our Junior year in High school. He promised that he’d never hurt me, and that he would love me forever. I know people can’t make promises like that and be held accountable, I’m just very confused over the whole thing. I waited to go to college so we could be together. We moved to a different state while attending a university, due to special complications neither of us graduated. We moved back to our home town and rented a room from my parents, it was a difficult transition to say the least. Both of us began to feel defeated, his feelings eventually developed into what I and many others see as depression. [/INST]  You met when you were only 16. As hard as this is, it’s not surprising that the two of you have drifted apart. Your boyfriend recognizes that you are a comfortable and familiar part of his life but not necessarily the one he would choose now that he is in his twenties. He’s kind and honorable enough to not pin the problem on you. He’s right. It’s not about you really. He’s trying to figure out if he is in a relationship with you out of habit or because you are really the one for him. As certain as you are, it would also be healthy for you to be asking the same questions.Sometimes when people in your situation take a timeout, they rediscover each other in a new way and start a new kind of relationship. Sometimes it becomes clear to both that they have a deep affection for each other based on knowing each other so well but it’s not the stuff of romance.

I suggest you both take a big step back for a time. Date other people. Finish school or get into a serious job training program. Start nurturing your own circle of friends and your own interests. You both need to find out who you are separate from the other. Once you do that, you’ll be able to bring a more developed adult self to the relationship. At that time, you’ll figure out for yourselves if you are indeed meant for each other.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m 21 and recently engaged. In a few years, I may want to have children. I have two concerns: will I have to stop taking antidepressants when I am pregnant and what is the likeliness that our children will be depressed if both myself and my fiancé have major depressive disorder? [/INST] These are two really good and important questions. I give you credit for taking the time to seek out answers. With regard to having to stop taking antidepressants while pregnant, this is something that only your doctor can answer. Generally speaking, it is recommended that antidepressants not be taken while pregnant but again, this will depend on your doctor’s opinion of your situation.As far as passing depression on to your children, the answer is less clear. Since the exact cause of depression has not been pinpointed, this is difficult to answer. Speaking in general terms, parents who have depression are more likely to have children with depression. Whether this is passed down genetically or through environmental interaction is not known but there is an increased risk.According to Psychology Today’s website, “We know that depression runs in families, which implies the influence of particular genes that may render an individual vulnerable to the illness. However, genes are just part of the picture. A child not only inherits genes, he or she inherits a family. Very often families with mental or behavioral disorders are also families in which there exists a considerable amount of dysfunction. That implies the influence of environment as well as genes. Indeed, population studies reveal that depression is more likely to occur in homes where abuse and conflict are persistent. Further research has shown that individuals who come from an environment rife with emotional conflict suffer more severe forms of depression and are less likely to respond to existing medications or treatments. So the next question is: How does this occur? How is it that the experience of the family might become embedded, literally, in the biology of an individual and render them more vulnerable to depression? What recent research tells us is that – in humans as well as laboratory mice – neglectful or abusive interactions between the parents and the offspring can render the offspring more reactive to the stressors in their environment. Meanwhile, studies in humans show that individuals who are more reactive to stressors in the environment are in turn more likely to develop depression.”If we look at people who have depression, we recognize that they often display outward symptoms of the disorder. Depressed individuals often are reclusive. They tend to have a negative self-image and low self-esteem. They have difficulty displaying appropriate emotions or dealing with difficult life situations. People with depression are generally sad and overall they have trouble handling everyday life.If children witness these types of emotions, behaviors and reactions that are being essentially modeled for them by their parents, they are likely to emulate what they see their parents doing. In turn, children may learn these maladaptive ways to handle their own situations by watching how their parents dealt with these similar circumstances. This is one way in which depression could be passed along to children. In this scenario, it’s not done intentionally by the parents but since the parents still suffer with depression symptoms, they have inadvertently modeled maladaptive skills to their children.It is very wise to be thinking about these issues prior to having children. Since you said that you are thinking about waiting a couple years before you have children, my suggestion is that you use these intervening years to help yourself and your fiancé overcome your depression symptoms. If neither of you are in therapy, this might be something to consider. Medication is a good start to helping your depression symptoms but rarely does medication on its own work to eradicate the disorder. Consider therapy. Thanks for your good questions. Take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, my name is Jane and I’m from Germany, I have already been in therapy for depression because I used to want to kill myself. Well, now I just want to kill people around me. I get really excited when I think about getting a gun and just killing people. I’m not interested in killing one person at a time in a slow and painful way but more in school shooting. Sometimes I just want to slit people’s neck or just stab them all over and dispose of the body as soon as possible. I actually do have friends now and I like them and I’m glad I do, but when I was a child I used to have none at all and I had a very bad relationship with my parents, I never felt like they actually loved me, now it’s different but I stil can’t get the pictures out of my head. I really just want to KILL for the pleasure but I can stop myself, my thoughts belong to myself and I want to pretend it’s alright and have others believe that and maybe these thoughts will go away.. Well, I just feel like everybody always leaves me and nobody truly loves me for who I am and I’m so sorry I’m such a f-up, I wish I was normal but I just.. am not. [/INST]  Hello, Jane. I’m concerned about your letter. You began experiencing severe depression that led you to want to end your life. You’ve now become fixated on the idea of killing others. The desire to want to kill or harm others is very unusual. It’s a sign of someone who is unwell, truly suffering and in need of intervention. Sometimes when people are suffering and perceive that they are being ignored, it angers them. They may want to seek revenge or punish the people who they think should be helping them.You must understand that killing is wrong. It certainly will not solve your problems. Killing involves the destruction of human life. Every religion considers murder a sin. It would ruin the lives of many people. You would also very likely spend the rest of your life in prison.It is important that you receive help immediately. Go to a hospital if you feel as though you cannot control your behavior. Call emergency services if necessary. You should immediately report your feelings to your parents or the school administrators. Once they are aware of your thoughts, they can assist you in receiving the appropriate psychological help. Counseling could assist you in developing coping skills to deal with your very strong emotions. Please seek help immediately. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve lived with my aunt for over 6 years and the past 4 have been hell she yells at me constantly and sometimes hits me. When she does I just think and have to stop myself from acting but I just know that i could kill her. How do i stop the urges? I’ve made plans about killing her then myself but I always stop myself. How do I tell my close friends about this and what should I do? She isn’t the only person I’ve thought about killing, the other is my female friends adopted dad who touches her and says explicit stuff to her. [/INST]   Rather than try to diagnose your mother start focusing on what you need to move out of the house and move forward with your life. You have already made the declaration that you do not want to be like your mom in many ways. Now the work is to figure out what you DO want to become. Aiming not to be her can be a good start, but figuring out what kind of life you want to live and what skills to develop is even more important. I’d encourage you to keep moving toward your independence. Diagnosing her, even if it were possible, isn’t likely to help as much as you developing yourself.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] For about two years now ive been leaveing with random violent thoughts thoughts of me or those close to me dieing in violent and terrible ways, and to not make anyone sick, a thought i had was actually me opening up my owe stomach with a box cutter and smile while i do then proceeding to pull out fat and acid and throwing it on the wall. others involve stabbings, shootings, falling to my death, and being killed by fictional or demonic monsters.my family seems more worried of my sudden acts of anger which seem to happen over the simplest things, i am also suffering from what i believe is paranoia, it just always seems like someone is watching me or something is going to come out of the woods and kill me. the thoughts get worse and worse and i do worry i will try and hurt someone like my friends or family if you need any other info please just ask i do not know what else to put. [/INST]  There seem to be three main issues. The first is that you are experiencing violent thoughts and images. I’m wondering how often this occurs (i.e., daily, weekly, monthly?) and how you handle these images when they arise. I’m also wondering what you are doing when they occur. Do they occur on the verge of sleep? During the day? Only in times of stress? After ingesting drugs or alcohol?Secondl your family is worried about your “sudden acts of anger” which seemingly occur over the “simplest thing.” It would have been helpful to know how often these sudden acts occur. It also would have helped me to understand this issue better if you had provided an example of a “simple thing” that angers you. Even without that information, your anger is concerning. It frightens and endangers your friends and family.Third, you are feeling paranoid. The paranoia is focused on someone watching you and your belief that someone is trying to kill you. Your paranoia seems to exacerbate your mental instability which as you said, has left you worried that you might hurt someone. This is yet another sign that you may be on the verge of losing control.The most responsible course of action is to seek professional mental health treatment. Your symptoms are concerning and they should not be ignored. Ask your primary care physician for a referral to a therapist or seek the services of a therapist directly. Clicking on the “find help” tab, at the top of this page, will assist you in accessing mental health treatment in your community.Your symptoms are clearly not well controlled and require professional intervention. Do what you can to seek the proper treatment. It would be irresponsible and ill-advised to ignore your symptoms and to continue living on the verge of losing control. I hope my letter convinces you to seek the proper intervention. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Canada: I’m sure this will sound absurd, but this is my situation. I’ve been in a relationship with a man for 2 years. We moved in together very early on. He has had a previous drug problem which he has sought help for. I found out last year that for most of the time we had been together, he was cheating on me with prostitutes. At that time, I was pregnant and we went to see a therapist and decided to work through it. Over this past year, he claims to have not cheated but I’ve found that he has been texting prostitutes several times. He denies ever doing anything and says he hasn’t cheated in a year. I do bring it up very often as I’m skeptical about how truthful he really is. [/INST]   You are not the problem. You are not crazy for thinking he’ll cheat. He has already betrayed your trust many times. My question to you is this: How many more times will he have to cheat before you believe that he is a cheater?Yes, you have problems of your own. Threatening to cheat as a pay back is immature and unwise. But that doesn’t absolve him of responsibility for his own actions.If you didn’t have a child, I would advise you to cut your losses and get out immediately. But since there is a child involved, it may be worth it to give this relationship one more try by getting some counseling. If you do, keep your child’s needs ahead of your own. What kind of relationship do you want your child to grow up believing is a good one? Only stay if you and your partner can make a healthy, respectful relationship with each other.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am 33 years old and have been with my wife for 11 years and married for almost 8. We have one son who is 5. Our marriage has been failing since our son was born, and he has become the only thing holding us together … our sex life has become nonexistent, “once a month” if I’m lucky. We have very little in common anymore, and our home feels more like a roommate situation, not a loving family. About a year ago I met someone at work who I have no doubt is my true soul-mate, we connect on every level. She makes me feel and see beauty in life that i haven’t felt or seen in years, if ever. I’ve never truly felt this way with my wife. We have been on dates and spend as much time together as possible, we have however not been intimate, out of respect for my situation. But the sexual energy is absolutely there. I don’t know what to do from here … we could try counseling, but even if we did I wouldn’t have the connection I have with the person from work!!! Please help me, any advice would be GREATLY appreciated. [/INST] A: Your question addresses a fairly common situation these days. I’m sure you are aware that the majority of marriages end in divorce and a high percentage of those involve some form of infidelity, whether it is emotional or physical. Many marriages that fail do so after a major life change, such as having children, going through a significant loss or some other crisis. It is difficult to keep the excitement and romance in a relationship when we are busy and stressed in other areas of our life.However, falling into the trap of chasing what is “out there” rather than fixing what is “right here” happens too often in my opinion. I have worked with lots of folks who thought they had found their soulmate outside of their marriage, only to find out later that it was the excitement and chase that created the magic. Affairs keep you in the almost addictive state of infatuation that we all crave, but, more often than not, that feeling fades once you are doing laundry and taking out the trash with the new love.My advice is to try counseling before you really decide to leave your marriage. You owe that to your wife, your son and yourself. Even if the counseling becomes more about how to leave the marriage creating the least amount of damage, it will be worth it. If in the end you still decide to leave, you will have a free conscience knowing that you tried everything. I feel this is especially important when children are involved. Not to mention, that therapists can help navigate shared parenting issues and offer suggestions to help your son through the transitions.I hope you find happiness and wish you the best of luck. </s>"

[/INST]  You asked if anxiety could be the cause of your medical problems. The answer is yes. Untreated anxiety can negatively impact physical health. Panic disorder, a type of anxiety disorder, involves having severe anxiety attacks. Panic attacks are intense episodes of anxiety and fear. During these attacks, people can experience shortness of breath, heart palpitations and chest pains. Severe cases of anxiety can be mentally and physically debilitating.While anxiety disorders can lead to physical health problems, it’s always wise to rule out medical problems before confirming a mental health disorder. If your doctors have ruled out medical problems, it increases the likelihood that you may have an anxiety disorder.I would strongly urge you to seek mental health treatment as soon as possible. There are many effective treatments for anxiety and panic. The most comprehensive treatments include both therapy and medication.In severe cases of anxiety, a doctor may prescribe a quick-acting medication called a benzodiazepine. Eventually, antidepressants and beta blockers may be added to assist with long-term symptom management.My recommendation is to consult a mental health professional who can evaluate your symptoms and determine the proper course of treatment for your possible anxiety disorder. The vast majority of people who seek treatment for an anxiety disorder have success. I hope you will consider this recommendation. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, I was wondering if maybe you could help me figure out what is going on here. I have been having problems for awhile. They’ve always sort of been there, but in the past year or so they have gotten much more intense and I’m worried about it. [/INST]  Thank you for the detailed letter. It helps to give me an idea of the struggles you face on a daily basis. All of the issues that you wrote about, hearing voices, paranoia, mood swings, confusing language, and so forth, are all symptoms that definitely need to be assessed by a psychiatrist or other mental health professional. Your instincts to seek help are very accurate and perceptive. I am glad that you and your boyfriend recognize the need to seek treatment. Please do not put off going to seek help.If you have your own health insurance, you can usually find a phone number listed on the back of the card that is labeled something like “mental health problems,” followed by an 800 number. When you find this number, call your insurance company and speak to them about which doctors you are authorized to see within your health care plan (i.e. inquire if you have to see certain doctors or can you see anyone you want), ask how to make an appointment, how many sessions and medication sessions your insurance company will pay for either with a therapist or a doctor, and finally, ask how much your co-pay will be for each visit. The information that you garner from this phone call should help get you started.If you have health insurance under your parents’ plan and you want to seek help but do not want your parents to know, this will be difficult because in all likelihood, your parents will be sent a statement from your insurance company after your visit. I hope this does not discourage you from seeking help. You mentioned that you believe your parents would upset or disappointed. I do not know what your relationship with your parents is like but they would probably be more upset if they knew that you felt it was necessary to hide the everyday mental pain and suffering from them just because you did not want to upset them. It would probably be more unsettling for them to find out that their daughter suffered just to protect them. It is not your job to protect them; it’s their job to protect and help you. Consider talking to them about your situation before you seek help and if you are not comfortable with this, it is important that you seek help anyway.If you do not have health insurance, or mental health insurance, (which even if you have health insurance is not a guarantee that you will have mental health insurance) consider a community mental health center (CMHC). CMHCs provide services oftentimes on a sliding scale fee or sometimes, if you qualify, free of cost. Lastly, if you attend college, you can also be evaluated by their university counseling center. Most university counseling centers have on-staff psychiatrists, along with social workers, and psychologists, and other mental health workers. These services are typically free of cost to registered students and their services are usually exemplary. I hope this answer helps you. Take care and be sure not to put off attending to your own health. </s>"
"<s>[INST] My son is 3,5 years old, his father is coming to visit him after 2 years, I’m not sure how to act When I met my ex-husband everything seemed perfect, very soon our son was born and he seemed as he is a perfect husband and father. In the meanwhile we moved to another country, we lived there for 6 months, and after that me and my son came back to our native country. Reason was that I was pregnant again and ex husband didn’t want the baby. We are divorced and he married another woman. He didn’t come to Serbia since we came back and now he is coming to visit our son. First year of our separation two of them ‘talked’ through Skype, then I realized that it is not very good for my son to have that kind of a relationship with his father (it seemed like he is getting attached to a cartoon character) so I ended that way of communication between them, advising my ex-husband to call our son on the phone any time he wants. He didn’t call at all. Recently he send me a mail saying that he is coming to visit our son, he is staying for two weeks, and he want’s to spend as much time with him as possible including sleepovers. I’m not sure how is my son going to react, and I am really concerned what consequences will this bring to him. I would like to the best for my sons sake, so I’m asking you to help me, advise me how often is the best for two of them to see each other during those two weeks. Should I be there for my son first time they see each other, or every time they see each other.. My son is going to be almost 4 years old when this visit is going to happen, and I have no clue if his is father going to visit him ever again. [/INST]  There isn’t a simple answer to your question. You didn’t mention your other child who will also be affected by this visit. Your ex-husband may not have wanted the baby but he is still the father. Your ex doesn’t seem to be thinking very clearly about the children’s needs. To them, he is a perfect stranger. They are not likely to respond warmly to him at first – which he may take as rejection. If his father doesn’t intend to keep up regular contact, your son is likely to be the one to feel rejected for yet a second time. Meanwhile, the younger child will have to live with his father’s lack of interest from the start.I don’t think you have enough of the information you need to make decisions. I suggest that you have several conversations on the phone with this man to try to find out why he wants to visit now and what his intentions are for a relationship in the future. Do talk to a lawyer about whether he has any legal right to see the children. Make certain you feel that the children are going to be safe with him, both physically and emotionally. By all means, stay with your son during the visits until you are sure that your ex has his best interests in mind and that he knows how to care for a four-year-old. You also need to know in advance whether the new wife is coming and what they think your children’s relationship with her should be. Once you have more information, I think you will be able to decide how to handle the situation. If not, do consider talking to a family or child therapist. A professional in your own country and culture is better able than I am to advise you in a matter that has potentially important consequences for all of you.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I know the way that I’m acting and thinking is not normal. I feel so lonely and detached from everyone around me. I just kind of float through school and I really have no friends there — no one I can connect with anyway. All I want to do is lay down and give up. I’ve thought about suicide multiple times. I really hope and pray that I get into a car accident so that it doesn’t look intentional. Whatever, anything so that I don’t have to suffer anymore. I just want to feel whole, I want my parents to listen to me. I’ve tried talking to them about it and they just swept in under the rug and that’s all they’re going to continue to do. “Not my boy!” they say. [/INST]  Thank you for writing. No. This is not “just a phase.” Unfortunately, the things you are doing to conquer your pain are now contributing to it. You’re developing a sleep disorder which can result in a deeper depression and even hallucinations. You are not giving your body and mind the nutrients they need to heal. If you want this to end, you need to do two things. First, start treating yourself the way you would treat a troubled friend. Feed yourself. Get some sleep. Secondly, if your parents aren’t helpful, you need to talk to the school counselor, your doctor, or a trusted adult who can intercede with them for you. Often parents will listen to another adult, even when they won’t listen to their child.I do understand why your parents don’t want to think something is wrong with their son. But it’s far better for them to hear that you are depressed — and to get you some help — than it would be for them to deal with finding you with blood on your arms or worse. Please take an adult you trust into your confidence and have a sit down with your folks.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From Puerto Rico: I have explained to my three year old that when people get really old they die since she experienced death scenes in a movie (in the movie both parents die and leave the girl orphan). So, she has cried asking me not to get old. Today before school she started crying because she didn’t want to get old because she didn’t want to die. [/INST]  I can tell this is really hard on you. You were trying to do the right thing and it seems to have back-fired. Instead of feeling better, your little girl seems to feel worse. I think she is a very bright 3-year-old. She may be young to be dealing with this but she’s letting you know you can’t avoid it. She isn’t willing to be put off with promises of heaven or to put the question aside. She is grappling with the big questions around love and loss and meaning.I have an idea that maybe she doesn’t think you understand her distress. Instead of arguing with her, however gently, why not just hold her and agree that it is indeed very, very sad that people and animals and every living thing come to an end. Let her cry it out. Soothe her but don’t contradict her or try to make it all right. Tell her that you get sad about it too.When she settles down, tell her she can always come to you when she is sad. Then see what happens. At that point, she may be more ready to hear that we hold people we love in our hearts and they never really go away; that our job is to make lots of good memories so we can carry on.There are lots of good children’s books about death that might be helpful. Talk to your librarian for suggestions or do a search online. Hearing some stories about how other children managed these big ideas may give your daughter new ways to handle it.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My 13 year old son has been before diagnosed with GAD, but recently he has been very depressed for most of the time, and only ever showing signs of happiness when he has food or toys. He spends most of his time alone, but his grades are fine. He never really wants to leave the house, and he never wants to socialize with his friends anymore. 2 years ago he switched to a private school for middle school, and we thought smaller classes would be better for him participating, but he is now detached from all his friends. Also, he gets very angry for no reason at me or my husband or people that have not directly done anything to harm him. He can get angry from the slightest thing. He seems to have trouble sleeping, and he says it is from thinking of something really said or worrying, and he cannot stop thinking about it. Girls do not hang out with him, but with many of the richer more popular boys, they like. He used to love doing a lot of things that he does not find enjoyment in anymore, and he doesn’t play sports. Many of the other kids make fun of him for being a nerd. He is mainly alone at school, and he stays away from the only people that he is friendly with because they can be fun when he is happy, but if he is sad, or angry, they drive him crazy. What can I do to help him? [/INST]  Your son was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and he might also have depression. Depression and anxiety commonly co-occur. He needs help.The best way to help your son is to facilitate his consulting a mental health professional. It might be best to choose a professional who specializes in working with teens, preferably teenage boys. Counseling could help him understand what’s wrong and work through whatever is bothering him. Family therapy might also be helpful. Upon your initial consultation, you can discuss whether individual or family therapy (or both) would be the most appropriate treatment.What you want to avoid, is minimizing his symptoms. Don’t regard them as a “phase.” Recognize that intervention is necessary and do whatever is needed to find him good help.A recently published book underscores the importance of not minimizing the symptoms of mental illness among teen boys. Sue Klebold is the mother of Dylan Klebold, one of the Columbine High School shooters. In her book, A Mother’s Reckoning: Living in the Aftermath of Tragedy, she writes with sincere regret about how she overlooked and minimized the psychological problems of her son. Her son’s problems seemed so normal at the time but we now know that his problems were anything but normal. Dylan was profoundly suicidal and his mother had no idea just how much he was suffering. Most teenagers never act out violently or become school shooters but even so, there is great value in her book. It can help parents recognize teenage depression and its many forms before it’s too late. All proceeds from the book will be donated to mental health charities.You will be doing your son a great service by facilitating his involvement with mental health professionals. It could mean the difference between him having lifelong psychological problems and his prospering in life. Study after study consistently shows that mental health concerns are as important as those of physical health. Please take care. </s>"

My fiance was getting really upset so I changed my phone number, moved in with him and started our life together. [/INST]  What I think you should do is get out of this relationship immediately. Your fiance is insecure and controlling. I’m guessing that he was badly burned in his prior relationships and now thinks that all women are cheaters. Yes, that makes his anxiety somewhat understandable. But it doesn’t give him the right to be constantly grilling you, monitoring your phone calls, and threatening you. That table going over should have been the very last straw!You have done nothing wrong. You don’t deserve to be treated this way. No one does. You shouldn’t have to constantly prove your innocence to a man who says he loves you. You are a working woman which means you will have work relationships that need your attention.

It has happened with others. She just happens to be the most frequent. I am a very anal, organized, tidy person. I am also a perfectionist. Please help me understand! [/INST]  It’s good that you recognize this as a problem. Acknowledging that a problem exists is the first step to making a positive change. It also means that you’re open to change. You have set the stage for a positive outcome.You have described a very correctable set of problems. You’re short-tempered and impatient. You take out your anger on your girlfriend and perhaps others. Your behavior makes being in your presence unpleasant and undesirable. It could cost you your relationship with your girlfriend. It’s a problem that needs to be corrected.Anger is a perfectly normal human emotion but it has become out of control for you. Reacting inappropriately with anger and being impatient ultimately stem from an inability to see reality clearly. Picture this scenario: you are driving to work and end up in a traffic jam. You are running late and can’t get there because you’re stuck. It’s infuriating. Your anger reaction is caused by the unrealistic expectation of there being no traffic. While that might be your expectation, it’s not the reality. The reality, at that moment, is a traffic jam. There is nothing you can do to change it. Sitting in traffic is agitating but anger does nothing to change or improve the situation. It’s an inappropriate reaction. What’s the more appropriate reaction? Accept the reality, see it for what it is and adjust your mindset accordingly.There are several ways to address this problem. The most effective method of treatment would be to see a therapist who specializes in anger management. Therapy will likely focus on the development of new coping skills and new ways of thinking about life situations.Also consider taking an anger management class. A well-designed anger management program can be immensely effective. You can learn how to properly express your anger in a healthy, constructive manner. You’ll learn that while you can’t control your feelings you can control how you react to them.A self-help approach involves educating yourself about anger. This would include reading anger management books and workbooks. You may want start with a book designed specifically for men with anger problems called Beyond Anger: A Guide for Men: How to Free Yourself from the Grip of Anger and Get More Out of Life.

"<s>[INST] From roughly the age of 9 I have had an extremely volatile relationship with my mother. From the outside looking in, she is a very law-abiding pilar of the community. Very pleasant to speak to within certain audiences, her family, our friends etc but when we are alone she is almost like a completely different person. As though her problems manifest into those few moments (I limit time alone with her now) and she lets it all out. How terrible her life and usually how myself and my father are to blame. I used to feel sorry for my father but now as an adult with my own children, I feel a sense of anger as to why he has allowed this to go on or was it that he doesn’t see the full extent of the emotional abuse. One time I remember as a child she was in one of her moods so I put my headphones in as a coping mechanism. We were in town and she grabs them out of my ears and told me to get lost (in polite terms) and I walked to my grandmother’s house which was around 4 miles away alone. My father came to collect me and I got told off as he did not believe it was my mother who told me to do this and I suppose that had a lasting impact as since then I don’t believe he trusts me as an innocent party. [/INST] It is time to make the break from your mother. She isn’t as interested in your well-being as she is in control. Taking the job, finding good childcare, and getting out from under her control should be your priority. Where your children get childcare is for you and your husband to decide. If she won’t see your children at all if you don’t do it her way, then this will be her loss.If you are worried about the degree to which you may be struggling emotionally it would always be acceptable to go for a psychological evaluation by a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist. But the situation you are describing here is a matter of of your mother believing she can threaten you by not caring for her grandchildren. You and your husband need to do what is best for you and you family — not what will appease your mother.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I recently found out the man I was in a 2-year relationship (long distance) was a new senior pastor of a church and was also married. I found this out by googling him. I called him and he told me he had been separated for almost 4 years, married 20. The pastor position came up out of the blue in January. I knew he was a minister and he had a different full time occupation. So, he said it was a calling from God and he knew he had to reconcile with his wife.

I would encourage you to fully express what it is you are feeling and then let the letter simmer for a day or two.Forgiveness from God? For what? Loving someone too much? When someone betrays you and takes advantage of you and lies to you in the name of a calling from God, this isn’t a spiritual awakening. It is pathology, pure and simple.I would seek counseling from a practitioner recommended by clergy. I would take the feelings and questions to him or her and let them help you sort this through. There are several issues here. There is the betrayal by a trusted friend and lover, there is a person in a minister’s position that is, at best, with questionable ethics and morality, and there is your own spiritual growth to tend to. By using someone from your religious background and focus in their counseling, you can sort through the best way to respond.I would bring them the letter you’ve written, and ask what is the best way to handle the feelings surrounding this. But I would also ask their opinion about the church’s rules about reporting a minister’s behavior. I would not make this decision on your own without a consult.

"<s>[INST] I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression about 2 years ago due to a stressful and unhealthy relationship and living environment. Within the next two years I’ve been on and off medication to treat it. I’ve done wreckless and crazy things like sneaking out, having sex, smoking marijuana, disobeying all sorts of stuff. This past year I went through a really hard relationship that caused insecurities, doubt, and depression. Just last month, at my job as a lifeguard I had to make a traumatic save and was later sent home because of shock. That same month, the guy that I had been with for a year really hurt me and is now with another female. I don’t know what kind of help I need. I’ve had two anxiety attacks in the past 2 weeks, I get angry and annoyed over pointless things and I always feel the need to be in charge or perfect. Please help me control this. I’m tired of crying about pointless things and never knowing what to do. I’m getting emotional and unstable right now as we speak. Please help. I’m willing to do anything. [/INST]  You have been prescribed medication for your anxiety and depression but the missing element of your treatment may be counseling. Medication can assist in restoring emotional stability but comprehensive mental health treatment typically requires both medication and counseling. Many people find that one without the other just isn’t enough.Counseling can assist you in dealing with the issues that you are facing. Many of your emotional reactions make sense given the experiences that you have endured. Your anxiety attacks may stem from these recent traumatic experiences.A therapist can teach you how to deal with anxiety in a healthy way. Problems are part of life. Expect them and learn how to deal with them. Counseling would be the perfect opportunity for you to learn these important and necessary problem-solving skills.In the meantime, it would be helpful for you to document your symptoms. Keep a journal. The more information a therapist has about your symptoms, the easier it will be to help you. I hope you consider counseling. I think you will be glad you did. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST]  I m an empath and my boyfriend is a narcissist. I tried a lot of times to heal his wound and characteristics problems. We have been in relationship for 6 years but in those years .i really love him,,,i always keep him first before me.but he just only care about him,,,he just only the takers and i m the givers ,,,he doesn’t care about my feelings,,,he cheated on me several times with other girls,, [/INST]  You have been with this guy since you were only 15. What you want and need now is much different than what you needed when you were so young. Clearly, this man loves himself far more than he loves you. The quick answer to your question is no. There is nothing you can do or say to win the kind of love you want and deserve at this stage of your life.Getting out of the trap will be difficult because he has maneuvered himself into so much of your life. You apparently have no experience with other men. You have not had the opportunity to work on learning how to manage your tendency to give too much and get too little. However, you can make a better life for yourself.First, leave this man and work on you. If you can’t access some good therapy, at least join one of the online support groups here at PsychCentral. Build your self-esteem so that you truly believe yourself worthy of love without having to be always the giver.Do not let your boyfriend the narcissist pull you back into this unhealthy relationship. He will try. It will be a blow to his ego that you leave him. But that is his selfishness talking. He isn’t interested in your welfare.Start getting to know other men. Start gently. Get involved with activities that include singles — both men and women. Do not look for a boyfriend for now. Just look for men who can be your friend. You have a lot to learn about other adults and a lot to learn about healthy relationships. Just get to know people and watch how people in good relationships treat each other.You are only 21. You have plenty of time to heal yourself and to find true and mutual love. Give yourself the time to grow and to find someone who can provide the loving attention that you boyfriend can’t. You deserve it.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I think this boy that goes to my school is obsessed with me. We met through skype and he hasn’t given me a moment to myself since. He’s a very good friend but he wants to talk/call with me every single day and i need some time to myself. During school he follows me around all day sometimes without even saying anything. I almost always have to start the conversations. He is so quiet because he told me that he gets very bad stomach aches and starts shaking whenever he is near me. He still has these even though we have been talking almost every day since august. I don’t like to see him sick like this but he insists on always being with me. He told me he wants to go out with me but i told him i just want to be friends. I feel awful because he likes me a lot but I don’t feel the same way. In January i finally told him that i needed some time to myself but he started crying and he kept apologizing that he was such a pest and he said he would leave me alone. I didn’t want to make him cry so in an effort to calm him down I told him I didn’t mean it and I don’t actually think that.He also gets mad if I do something he doesn’t like, some examples are when we first started talking I didn’t say good morning enough to him. He told me he felt like I didn’t care about him and he was very angry with me because of this, he started texting to me in all caps and looked annoyed at school. I thought it was an extremely stupid thing to get upset about. Another time was when my friends downloaded halo(a pc game)at school and I played it with them “too much” in the morning before school (20mins). He told me I was being very selfish because I wouldn’t have a conversation with him. So I stopped. But he is still quiet when around me. More recently he told me he has been suicidal and is extremely depressed because we haven’t been calling enough even though we text every.single.day. I don’t know what to do and I don’t want to hurt his feelings or worse. help. (From the USA) [/INST]   It sounds like you already know what to do but aren’t quite able to do it yet. That is a different thing than not knowing. You sound very clear that you do not like to be smothered by this boy, feel too controlled by him, that he makes you feel guilty, and is blaming you for his depression and suicidal thoughts. None of this is okay. The fact that he has shared that he has been suicidal changes everything. This is not healthy — and not something you can manage on your own. I would immediately talk to the guidance counselor in your high school and let him or her know that this is going on. Your friend needs help and you being nice to him because you are worried about him emotionally is an indication that he needs more help than you can give. In some ways it is like being bullied: he uses he emotions to try and control your behavior.Please make this a priority. Your friend needs help from others. The best thing you can do as a friend is help him best by letting others know he is having thoughts of hurting himself.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My wife and I have been divorced for 2 years. My 11 year old son loves baseball and is very good. My ex does everything she can to not let him play. When he is with her he misses practices and has missed games. He of course is not happy with this but is very respectful and does not question as to why. She even went so far as to not let him complete his last season and didn’t let him play in the final tournament, stating simply they had other plans. (Which of course they did not). [/INST] I think the problem isn’t baseball. The problem is that your wife and maybe you are still fighting but you are doing so through your son. If you were focused on your child instead of on who does what or differences in opinion about what is best for him, the two of you would be able to negotiate getting him to games and practices, regardless of who he is staying with at the time.It won’t damage a child for life to not be allowed to play a particular sport. It can damage his relationships with both parents, his sense of himself, and his ability to trust and love if he is in the middle of his parents’ inability to co-parent in a way that is in his best interests, not their own.I strongly urge you and your wife to involve a mediator or family therapist to help you figure out how to co-parent and get your son out of the middle. He deserves better. Both you and your wife will be better prepared for managing the many changes that go with parenting a teen.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I’m not sure how to define my husband’s behavior. I keep thinking “passive-aggressive” though I don’t know if that is correct. [/INST] I’m sorry this troubles you so much. It seems to me that it is a pattern of language that has probably been with him for a very long time. He is unlikely to change it. It doesn’t really matter. You know his meaning even if you don’t like his style.What concerns me is that it looks like the two of you are fighting about communication style instead of something of much more serious consequence. You said he is morbidly obese and that it interferes with his ability to move to even do the simplest things. The fights about his language style are an effective distraction but they are only that — a distraction. Your husband’s obesity is endangering his life and affecting the quality of your life together. You have been enabling his food issues by doing things for him that would otherwise require him to move.I urge you to let the communication issue go. Instead, focus on the much more serious health issue. You can’t make him lose weight. You can’t make him care. But you can tell him how much it scares you that you will lose him because of his weight. You can let him know that you love him enough not to do things for him so he doesn’t have to move. You can offer to go with him to a doctor and nutritionist to learn how best to address the issue and how you can be an effective support.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] About a month and 1/2 ago my wife started thinking someone was hacking into her Facebook account and reading her notifications. I put all the security measures in place and ensured her she was safe. It has gradually gotten worse to the point she believes people are watching us through our cell phones and webcams. She thinks people are following her around town and have even been in our house and her car. She thinks all of our computers and phones are hacked and most of the things she believes are going on just aren’t possible. A couple months ago she would have thought the things she is telling me are happening are crazy. Now she truly believes it’s all real. I’m very worried about her. This is consuming her and destroying our marriage. I don’t know how to ask her to go see someone because she doesn’t think anything is wrong. I just don’t know what to do. She’s 33 years old and we have two kids. She’s an awesome mother and talking to her she still seems like the same person I’ve always known besides her belief in this one crazy idea. All of this is new to me so I’d appreciate any advice. [/INST]  Your wife seems to be paranoid and delusional. At this point in time, it may be too early to know if she has schizophrenia. Paranoia and delusions are associated with several psychotic disorders, schizophrenia being one of them.Symptoms of psychosis can also be the result of drug use and in rare instances, organic brain disease.Generally speaking, psychosis does not go away on its own. It typically requires treatment. It tends to get worse over time, with an individual’s behavior becoming increasingly worrisome and potentially dangerous. The sooner that she can receive treatment, the better. When it comes to psychosis, time is of the essence.Psychosis is a break with reality. People with psychosis are no longer able to think rationally. Their perception of the world is skewed. Your wife doesn’t think anything is wrong with her and that is typical among people with psychosis. They have difficulty judging their perceptions accurately.I would recommend that you make an appointment for her to see a mental health professional and go with her. She’s probably not going to understand why she needs to be evaluated by a mental health professional, and she may even come to see you as her enemy. It’s best to psychologically prepare yourself for that possibility. Try not to take it personally. It’s likely going to be a confusing and scary time for her but if you are supportive and understanding, this will help.When you both meet with a mental health professional, report all of your concerns. You could do this in the presence of your wife, but it may be better to do it outside of her presence; it all depends on the situation. The mental health professional should provide you with guidance about how to proceed. Generally speaking, psychosis is most effectively treated with medication. Medication can decrease the symptoms of psychosis and in some cases, eliminate them entirely.If your wife is unwilling to see a mental health professional, then contact a mental health professional who can assist you in handling this situation. Contact your local National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) support group. They are an advocacy group who helps people in circumstances like yours. I hope this helps. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have a history of repeated physical abuse by my father in childhood, stimulated by minor factors like a slightly lower grade or poor handwriting. I am also unfortunate to have witnessed my father being violent to my mother and sister. All of which are imprinted in my mind and still make me cry on recollection, both my parents died of cancer in the past two years. I have always had difficulty in concentrating on studies, except , paradoxicay, while watching movies or reading noves where I lose track of the surroundings and people often have to call me repeatedly then. I have been engaged the past year to a kind hearted man, but I have a problem of being offended by the slightest comment, which makes me miserable the whole day and I yell at him or message him till he relents and apologises, sometimes even that doesnt placate me and I carry on till I really hurt him, after which I feel guilty and keep apologising. I also keep having pangs of jealousy when he talks about other women, in his work or past, even though irrational. I also have the trouble of making decisions, especially split second ones, so I’m scared to learn driving as it involves a lot of split second decisions, and often rely on others to make decisions for me, sometimes bad ones. I used to write a lot of poetry earlier, but stopped the past 3 years. I also procrastinate very badly and have a incapacitating fear of darkness that I cant explain. I feel no one understands me and have brooded over death a long time, though I havent taken active steps to end my life. I feel a lot of this is attributable to the violence encountered from my father, though I am not sure. I do not drink or smoke. [/INST]  I’m sorry to hear that you have been struggling. Suicide should never be a consideration for you or for anyone. All of the problems that you have described are highly treatable with counseling. Many people have experienced or witnessed abuse as children but have recovered from their experiences. You can recover too.You mentioned relationship problems. In all likelihood, your negative childhood experiences are impacting your current relationships. Once you recognize inappropriate behavior, you can then work to change it. Counseling could help you to make these positive changes. Perhaps your fiancé would attend counseling with you, to support you and to help correct these relationship problems.You also described experiencing fear and perhaps even depression. These problems are not something that you should accept as your reality. They are highly treatable. I would strongly encourage you to seek counseling.Sometimes, people mistakenly believe that seeking professional help is akin to being a failure. That is simply not true. We are not born with problem-solving skills. These skills must be learned. Some people learn these skills from their parents or other role models, but not everyone has this luxury. Mental health professionals can teach us these important problem-solving skills. It’s the most efficient way to correct life problems. I hope you will consider it.If you feel as though you might harm yourself or someone else, call emergency services. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From at teen in the U.S.: I’ve had problems since childhood. When I was 12, I finally stopped fighting & and went to a psychiatrist. She started me on Prozac, which I still take now. After months I felt fine and stopped taking it. For a few months I still felt okay. [/INST]   Since you are seeing a prescriber, I hope, I hope, you are sharing with him/her what you wrote to me. You put together an articulate history of your experiences that would be very useful to anyone who is trying to help you. It is possible that you are having adverse reactions to medication. It is possible that your diagnosis needs revising. It’s possible that something else is going on.What you didn’t mention was whether you have been seeing a therapist as well as a prescriber. If not, it’s important that you do so. Generally, either because of insurance issues or because there simply aren’t enough doctors, prescribers can only see their patients every few months. They often don’t have the time to delve too deeply into a person’s psychology. They therefore usually prefer to be on a therapeutic team that it made up of you, a counselor and the prescriber. Working together, symptoms can be treated both medically and psychologically.If you haven’t already done so, please talk to your prescriber about whether a referral to a talk therapist would add to your treatment plan. A mental health counselor you can see regularly is likely to help in your efforts to manage whatever it is that is giving you so much distress.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hello, I’ve been diagnosed with depression since I was about 16 years old and I have dealt with the problem on and off again for the last 7 years. When I was 18 years old, my father was murdered and my family was emotionally devastated. I wasn’t close to my dad but I felt the impact it had on my family, before the people responsible were found and arrested, my family and I became worried about potentially being followed by and hurt by the same people who killed y father. To make matters worse, media and news outlets were broadcasting images of our home and I personally became extremely paranoid and fearful of my family and I being harmed by the men responsible for killing my father and feared being persecuted by them and these thoughts eventually dissipated soon after a few weeks or months. Fast forward three years later just before I turned 21, I became incredibly obsessed with death and dying and I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. I did fairly well from the end of 2011 through 2012 but at the beginning of 2013 another death in the family shook me up and I had another depressive and anxious episode. This has continued through most of 2013 but has not been as intense as it was two years before. Over the past few months, since about September I’ve become very worried that I may have schizophrenia or perhaps an undiagnosed personality or obsessive compulsive disorder. I do not experience hallucinations or delusions but sometimes before falling asleep I do sometimes “hear” or experience loud feedback like sound or bangs and this has further made me worry about the possibility of being schizophrenic. Recently I remembered my fear of being persecuted or watched after the death of my father but this was an isolated incident and I’m not sure if it is indicative of a possible issue with schizophrenia or not. I do see a talk therapist and have shared this fear before but have yet to go into detail with them ( I can only see them while school is in session). Am I schizophrenic? Or is it just anxiety or maybe OCD making me think things that aren’t true? Is my situation more “legitimate” as the possibility of being in danger was more real? Thanks. [/INST]  You have raised some good questions. With regard to your fear and paranoia about your family being in danger after your father was murdered, I see this as “legitimate” fear. At the height of your fear, the killer had not been caught. Your home was being featured on the nightly news and thus everyone watching knew where you lived, which may have included the perpetrator of your father’s murder. Your fear was perfectly justified in that situation.In recent months, you have become worried that you have schizophrenia or another mental health disorder. Your primary reason for believing that you may be developing a mental health disorder includes hearing noises before falling asleep. That is not an uncommon occurrence. Many people have similar experiences when they are on the verge of sleep. I would not consider that a symptom of schizophrenia or any other mental health disorder (in the absence of other symptoms).It’s impossible to provide a diagnosis over the Internet. Given the information you have provided, schizophrenia seems like an unlikely possibility. I would recommend having a mental health evaluation. The advantage is that the evaluator can collect all of the necessary information about your psychosocial history and determine if a diagnosis is warranted. It would also be advantageous to speak to a primary care physician about your sleep concerns. He or she may suggest having a sleep study to rule out a possible sleep disorder.You’ve experienced a great deal of trauma in your life, perhaps more than the average person. It’s encouraging that you are undergoing counseling. You’re doing what you should be doing but it’s important to be completely open and honest with your therapist. The more information you provide to your therapist, the more he or she can help you. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve known this for about 13 years. I am 30 years old now. I had a brief (few months) relation with a boy 12 years ago that was ended and then confessed to the parents of the child. Since then, over the years, there have been recurrant thoughts and indulgence in certain types of media and, for a short time, online chatting. This has all stopped, and I am in therapy now (having revealed all of the above to the therapist, who informed me of her legal obligations and professional concern…everything addressed as it should be), of my own volition. I have also brought this up to my circle of friends, and thereby lost most of them. My life is very difficult right now, but I’ve so far been able to keep myself from the old habits and look into ways of changing. What I’m glad about is that I’m doing this without being forced to. As thrilling as it was to have a dirty secret, it’s worthwhile for me to not feel like I’m hunted and a monster. I’m glad that, even though technically, I could be jailed for whatI’ve done, I have brought this into the light without getting caught and thrown away. I’ m doing this, not because and the state says I must, but because I say I must. I’m glad that some people have been very understanding and supportive. I am still loved. What worries me are three main concerns: Firstly, I wonder about myself. There were times in the past when I decided to give it up, but I started looking at stuff again (the almost-entire majority of this thing was looking at pics/vids) and then that would continue for a while. I know I have to change. It’s either move forward on the path I’m on, or end up perpetuating a cycle that thrives on the exploitation of those who don’t comprehend exactly how they’re being used. It seems like many things in my life…many grand ideas…get left behind like forgotten toys. I don’t want that to happen with this. I’ve heard of the recidivism rate of offenders and it’s a bit daunting. My prime hope is the theraputic process. But I’ve only had three sessions of psychotherapy and I don’t have all that much money, so I’m worried that I have to skip appointments so I can pay my bills and such. It’s depressing. [/INST] Thank you for your honesty. Your narrative is similar to what other pedophiles describe, maintaining this is not something within their control and they must be stopped, treated and controlled.Changing your sexual proclivity towards children is extremely difficult and some researchers say it’s nearly impossible without drastic measures. While therapy can help you to control your urges and desires to some extent, outcome studies show it is not successful in changing your orientation towards children. It would be like giving therapy to change someone’s homo or hetro sexuality—it simply has not been proven to work. Some researchers advocate chemical castration as a treatment—taking Depo-Provera to decrease testosterone levels. No uniform treatment is mandated in the United States for those convicted of molestation.No one knows for sure what causes molesters to molest but more and more research shows pedophilia is not easily cured, if ever. Without drastic medical procedures or continuous supervision of you and your child, I would strongly recommend not having children so that you are not faced with desires that you have described as predominantly uncontrollable. It would not be fair to any child given your history and what is currently known about pedophilia.You also mention the unfairness of society’s reaction towards the pedophile. I think it is most important to realize that nothing is more unfair than the molestation of a child. The child is the ultimate victim and you must control yourself or have society control you with what ever means necessary to protect the sanctity of the child. I wish you the very best of luck in this process. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From S. Africa: I am a 20-year-old female that has had attachment issues since early childhood. As a child I was also selectively mute. I started going for therapy when I was about 5. While I am very confident when speaking now, my attachment issues have lingered and got worse with age. My relationships are quite unstable (romantic and non-romantic) and my moods are very unstable as well — I can fly into a rage from one comment and then completely worship a person who gives me a hug. [/INST]  You are clearly a thoughtful and insightful person. If you could solve this problem by yourself, you would have done so already. For that reason, I think you should see a therapist — both for a more thorough evaluation and to explore options for treatment.I’m not at all sure that the problem is one of attachment. Maybe. But there are other diagnoses that share the same symptoms. Borderline Personality Disorder and Bipolar disorder are a couple of the other possibilities. A treatment is only effective if it is addressing the issue. Do make sure you are being treated for the right problem.Please take care of yourself. You are only 20. If you get proper treatment now, you can have a long life with satisfying relationships.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I guess I’ll just start from the beginning. I met my boyfriend during my junior year of college in Florida. We started out as friends for a couple of months. He was my marijuana dealer. I was a student, who worked as an exotic dancer and the local strip clubs with my wild group of girlfriends. I’d had plenty of experience with men and dating, but no serious relationships up to that point. He fell head over heels in love with me. As time passed I grew to love him too. I honestly believe he’s the only man who’s ever loved me for who I really am. Unfortunately the relationship has never completely satisfied me. I’m ashamed to admit this but I’ve cheated on him many times. This has caused so much strain on our relationship. He became jealous, possessive, and even violent at times. However, despite the infidelity and the fighting we can’t seem to stay away from each other. We have a deep connection that we are both afraid to lose. I’ve tried to break up with him many times to spare both of us the agony. But every time I lack the strength to carry it through and I run back to him. Is this love? Please give me some advice! [/INST]  I don’t think it would be accurate of me to suggest that your relationship is crazy. It sounds as if there is a very powerful connection between the two of you. That disconnection is painful and obviously the relationship means a great deal to both of you.What might be a better question is: Is your relationship real intimacy? The infidelities in which you engage would seem to be designed to sabotage and prevent intimacy. I think the real question here is how much intimacy can you handle?If I were to answer: “Yes, this relationship is definitely love,” how would this change your behavior? If I say: No, it isn’t love –what would this do? But if we have to ask how much intimacy can you tolerate, I believe we get much closer to the issue.I would strongly recommend individual therapy for you to unravel this question. I don’t think things can improve until you understand more about what intimacy means for you.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi thank you for taking the time to read this. My girlfriend and I are on our 6 month anniversary. I love my girlfriend very much to the bottom of my heart, the problem is I usually get suspicious about her cheating on me and seeing other guys. My girlfriend prefers the indoors, she always makes friends through the Internet. She even met her first boyfriend in the Internet. She decided to tell me about her previous relationship and that it lasted for about a year. They have never met in person but what devastates me the most is that she said that she would make video calls with him and show her bras and panties. She admitted to me that she used to be so slutty back then and she says that she changed for me. Everyday she spends her days video chatting with her friends. Most of the time it’s usually her “Internet friends”. She also still talks to her ex online because she says that her best friend is dating her ex. She would always push me and would go to her Internet friends. What I’m worried about is that she could be seeing someone online and showing nude pics or whatever. We argued about that already. She knew she was pushing me and had apologized for it. She also says that she would never cheat or see anyone in the Internet. The problem is that I still don’t believe her because she stays up all night to video chat with her friends. She and I do not really go on dates anymore. What I did was I would just stop by and say hi and goodbye then she goes back to her laptop. Also I can’t do anything at all, I can’t check on her laptop or anything. I’m still having suspicions of her cheating. For all i know she might already have a backup boyfriend or is seeing someone online and i don’t even know it. What should I do? How do I trust her? How can I get rid of this jealousy whenever she talks to guys in real life and online? [/INST]  I appreciate the distress you feel, but I am confused. You say she is your girlfriend, but then explain that you argue regularly about her behavior, you don’t go on dates, she prefers her video friends over you, she is secretive, and you are constantly worried that she is unfaithful. This doesn’t sound like you having a healthy, loving relationship. She sounds more like a source of frustration rather than a source of reciprocal love. I would stop looking for something from someone who doesn’t appear that interested in giving it. Perhaps it is time to find a real rather than virtual girlfriend.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My boyfriend is a year and a half younger than me so i knew going into it that i might have issues with him being a bit immature in certain areas of our relationship, but when we first started dating he was my perfect guy. After two and a half years he’s still an amazing guy but there are things that are ruining our relationship and I’m not sure if I’m just being impatient or if its just not going to work. [/INST]  If you were sure about this guy being marriage material, you wouldn’t care if he made a ring out of a paperclip. It looks to me like thinking about a ring is a great distraction from some much more important issues. He’s not a “bit” immature. He’s a lot immature. At 25, he’s still being irresponsible about such adult responsibilities as paying his bills and managing his credit. When he gets mad, he throws tantrums. He sounds like he’s about 14 years old and you are being put in a mother role. Please. You deserve far better.Many couples take turns making the lion’s share of the money for the two of them so each can pursue school or some other goals. But it can only work when the person who is on the receiving end of the financial support is appreciative and shows it by doing as much as she or he can to contribute. That includes being careful with the money that does come in. Your guy doesn’t even manage paying his own bills on time!However charming he is, I do suggest you take a big step back. Move out, stop paying his way, and let him fend for himself so he can experience the consequences of being so disinterested in how money comes and goes. Otherwise, how is he ever going to learn? If he cleans up his financial act, then you can enjoy his other qualities without putting your financial future on the line. Same thing goes for his temper. If he is only controlling himself because you’ve threatened to leave him. He has some personal work to do. He needs to learn self-control because that’s what adults do.You aren’t being selfish to want him to man up. But I do think you are fooling yourself if you think he is mature enough to think about marrying.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am 20 years old and I have recently been diagnosed with severe depression. For some time now, I have also been having trouble with anxiety (panic attacks), self-harm, alcohol abuse and suicidal thoughts. Recently, when my doctor asked me about a specific event that may have caused my mental health issues, I didn’t know what to answer. However, later that day I had a flashback – one specific scene about me as a child lying on the ground, frozen, and a guy from my school, naked, forcing himself on me. I remember having the exact same flashback every now and then for many years now. Until now, I always feared going to the gynecologist, thinking s/he may find out about what I had been doing or even find that I was pregnant (despite the fact it was years before I had had my first period). The problem is, I don’t know what really happened. I cannot remember anything else about the incident and when I was younger I also had nightmares about it, making me question whether it had been a nightmare all along. Plus, I would have been between 5 and 10 years old when it happened (I have some issues with my childhood memory) and the guy from this scene was from my class. He was, at most, 1 year older than me. How do I know if all of this really happened? And is child sexual abuse between children (with the same age) even possible? (From Germany) [/INST] You have taken a very brave step in answering this question because it is allowing you to dig a little deeper into what may be causing the pain. I typically encourage people who are having the flashback to not worry too much about if they are “real” or not, because the flashback is real enough to cause your concern. Take it at the level that the flashback is real and that makes it worth exploring. Whether it was an event that happened the way you’ve recalled it or not isn’t as important right now as honoring the fact that this line of questioning has opened up aline of inquiry and investigation that may have value.Let the doctor know that you’ve had this flashback and together he or she can help you determine the next course of treatment. If the doctor asked the question the chances are he or she would know how to advise you on dealing with whatever answer you gave.Let me restate how courageous you are for writing us here and being willing to explore the next step in healing.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"

Then, she turned the same volatile screaming on me one day because she didn’t like that I was doing my MBA homework. I have never returned. [/INST] Thank you for writing. I understand your concerns, especially with your history with your father.Sadly, there is no way you can “make her understand”.  It’s impossible to reason with someone who is irrational to begin with.That being said, I want to assure you and are other readers that not everyone who suffers a traumatic brain injury has the same symptoms. Not everyone who suffers a head injury is filled with rage or is violent as a consequence.I can’t tell from your letter how much of your neighbor’s behavior has been caused by the TBI or if she uses the TBI to excuse controlling behavior. Apparently, she can control herself at least at times.As I read your letter, I had to wonder where her husband is in all this. Has he found ways to calm her? If so, it might be helpful to talk to him about his experience. And I had to wonder if she stays in control when your husband goes over there.I don’t have enough information to give you concrete advice. I can only suggest that entirely withholding a visit with baby may throw fuel on her fire. It might be strategic for you to bring baby over for a brief visit but with both your husband and hers present to supervise her and support you. I don’t think she should hold baby because she is so unpredictable. You can plead “first time mother nervousness” for not letting that happen. Immediately leave if she starts to be abusive in any way. Tell her that you will revisit only if she can learn to control herself.  This kind of preemptive visit will prevent any accusations that you never even tried.If this continues to be a concern, you may need to consider moving. We can’t choose our neighbors. But sometimes we can choose whether to stay in the neighborhood.I wish you well. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Why do people spread rumours about me? I am glad that I found this fourm. All my life I have been the subject of the rumor mill. I am a shy guy who tries to do the right things. I believe in dealing with people as fairly as possible. It has been hard for me to understand why people would spread rumors about me. When the rumors are place side by side that just don’t add up? Let me tell you all of them. In high school and college, I was a virgin. I would like to have had sex with the person I married. I express my views and it was well known. However, some people spreaded a rumor that I was gay. I never could understand that rumor because I like women. I just did want to sleep with them because I wanted a degree and job. I knew that could side track me too much. [/INST] A. The question that you have to ask your self is why do so many people consistently misinterpret and misjudge both your behavior and intentions. It’s possible that you have surrounded yourself with people who are not competent to judge you or it’s possible you have surrounded yourself with people who are competent to judge you. I think it’s fairly safe to say that the people around you fall some where in between factual and inaccurate in their judgments. It’s important for you to recognize that though you may not be guilty of the things you are accused of there is something sufficiently odd about your behavior such that it generates rumors and misperceptions. You said you’ve had a lifelong problem with people saying these things about you, creating these rumors. Though these things may not be true, you have to determine what you are doing to cause people to form false negative opinions about you. I would recommend that you work with a good therapist who can help you to identify these things. </s>"
"<s>[INST] From the U.S.: I had been in a relationship with my girlfriend for 14 months; we don’t live together. We both have anxiety issues, but I also suffer from chronic depression. She comes from a very strict family that’s also severely neat. [/INST]  The better question is “why are you staying with someone who is so controlling?” This is an example of the power an apparently weak person can have on the people around her. By accusing you, “needing” you, and berating you for being “unfair” to her, she is creating a situation where you feel you have to be constantly at her beck and call and constantly meeting her standards. You said nothing in your letter that suggests there is a balance in the relationship.If your depression is keeping you in this relationship, please work on that. You deserve better than this. My vote, on the basis of what you shared, is that you take a huge step back from this woman and work on yourself.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years and have been living together for a little over 3 years. About a year ago his friend stayed over at our house while we were out on vacation, I’ve never met his friend before and only said yes because he said his friend was trustworthy. His friend ended up bringing over a female coworker and not letting us know but I found an eyeliner so I was upset and asked my boyfriend to talk to him since he didn’t want me to talk to his friend myself. Fast forward to last night his friend (the same one) called me my boyfriends ex-girlfriends name. Keep in mind this guy has been at my house and my boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. I got upset and ended up leaving early because I was so mad and didn’t want to make a scene with someone I barely knew. Before I left I told my boyfriend he needed to talk to him because his friend disrespected me and made me wonder why he would call me someone’s name who was in my boyfriend’s life over 4 years ago. He said he talked to him and told him to apologize to me so his friend tried to add me on Instagram to apologize. I want nothing to do with his friend and I’m upset that all my boyfriend did was have a talk with his friend that I made him have and then went on to act like nothing happened. Now we’re arguing because I’m afraid my boyfriend doesn’t respect me since he did absolutely nothing except what I asked him to do. I feel like I shouldn’t have to deal with after being with him for 4 years, we also just bought a house together 3 months ago. Am I wrong to want him to do more than just talk to his friend (a talk I asked him to do) ? He thinks I’m being unreasonable and doesn’t think it’s a big deal since his friend made a mistake. [/INST] Your boyfriend did what you asked of him, and his friend apologized. It also doesn’t sound like there were any rules explained to the friend about not having a guest over the house while he stayed there. This adds up to a misunderstanding and an error. You are welcome to hold a grudge and drive a wedge between yourself and your boyfriend, but I’d consider lightening up, forgiving these infractions and not creating more from what this is.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] The year 2011 has been incredibly stressful and full of many changes. It’s been academically rigorous since it is my junior year of college and I studied for the medical school graduate examination for months on end. I also had really tough science-based classes like Biochemistry and Physics II to cope with this past semester. My stress level was extremely high from January to May, and I thought I would be relieved at the end of the spring semester to end all of it. I did well in all my classes. I planned on taking the MCAT, then completing my med school applications, and then going out of the country to enjoy my summer. It was an awesome plan–an awesome plan that would never materialize in reality. [/INST]  Please stop being so hard on yourself. It sounds to me like you are grieving. You are still working through the anger and hurt and sadness of losing someone you loved and admired. It makes absolute sense to me that you feel like you’re in a fog. It’s normal and appropriate.Meanwhile, the unconscious is a wonderful thing. You already had doubts about your choice of career. In a way, your grief let you do what you didn’t have the courage to do on your own. You gave yourself a way out by doing badly on the test. You and I both know that you can elect to take the test again. Many people are so nervous during their first try that they don’t do very well so they spend more time studying and take try again. You could too. But your mother’s reaction tells me that it’s been tough for you to simply have a rational discussion about a change of direction. You had to blow out to get out. Okay. So now you are free to think about law. Sounds fine to me.Your mother is a pain for the same reason you’re in a fog. People grieve differently. Some people, like your mother, take it out on others. Some people, like you, take it out on themselves. Ideally, people love and support each other through it. Since it seems your mother can’t do that, I hope there are other people in the family who can. It’s important to remember, to tell stories, to share how much someone meant to you, and to mourn. If there is no one else who knew him that you can talk to, I hope you will consider looking for a grief support group. Many hospitals offer that service. You could start by asking your doctor for suggestions.Please give yourself time. It often takes months and years to fully metabolize a sudden and senseless death. Right now you’re still in the acute stage. That will level off. But don’t be surprised if every now and then you feel overcome by sadness for a few minutes or hours. These “grief attacks” are often set off by a smell or sound or story that reminds us of the person we lost. They are expected and normal.I hope you give yourself the summer to relax a little and to think through what you really in your heart of hearts want to do for a profession. You are clearly intelligent and disciplined. It looks to me like you can be successful at whatever you choose. You have reason to have faith in yourself.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My dad left us when I was 10. I was brought up by mom single-handedly. She worked most of the time and I used to be alone at home. I was harassed and bullied by my uncle and his family with whom mom and myself stayed for 7 years before we could manage to stay on our own. I started working when I was 18 and have been working since then. I feel I’m always in need of love and affection. I would do anything for a person who shows me slightest of love. I have been in 2 serious relationships which didn’t work out and left me in complete mess. I was approached by one of my school friends recently who wanted to be with me. I was really happy. But due to my hot temper he has taken a back step and probably is no longer interested. I’m depressed. I feel lonely and crave for companionship. My work seems fine, but I feel I am stuck in one place. My relationship with my mom is quite strained as we keep on fighting with each other and hardly talk. She stays with me as there’s no one to take care of her. A person looking at me would say that I’m fine as I kind of wear a happy mask while I’m at work. But deep down I feel sad and angry. Angry because I have no one. People my age have got married and settled. I am scared I will end up lonely. I am not good looking either. Therefore probably guys don’t approach me. I can’t sleep at night. I lay awake for hours, cry a lot and feel lonely. I wish to die and end this. I feel it all started because my dad left. Please help. (From India.) [/INST]  I hear in your struggle the courage and resilience you have demonstrated and looking for something better. While I certainly understand the level of your frustration, what I hear is a young woman who has met many adversities, and yet is able to pick herself up again and again and keep trying.Everything I know about success in anything, love or work, has to do with resilience and courage. I believe it is time for new things in your life. Take the bull by the horns. Give yourself the daily challenge of introducing yourself to new people. Give yourself the weekly challenge of trying something new. In order to grow you must re-create yourself in new ways. Meeting new people and learning new thing sis the best way to do this.Finally, I think it would be important for you to find a trusted person outside your family you can talk to about your thoughts, feelings, and plans.

"<s>[INST] My husband lost his second job in 4 years last Oct/Nov. He never really helped with the house or the two younger kids, 10 and 7, before he lost his job and always spent extravegently. But with him being off work for so long this time I hoped he would have made some effort to help out, especially since we are about to have a fourth child and I have started to have to work over time to make ends meet, and at least stop spending the way he does. So far in the last year he has went to Florida twice, Colorado once (where he took in a baseball game, rented three cars- two at $400 a day to four wheel and one just to drive around), and Indianapolis (where he went to the Indianapolis 500). He is shopping constantly, spending 1000’s on fixing his numorous cars, spending at least two nights a week at bars with friends (where I usually have to come pick him up), and spending 100’s a month on his daughter, 15. Since I am working over time he has been left in charge of our two younger girls at night and homework is not getting done, he doesn’t feed them dinner (I do ususally around 8:30-9), the kids are constantly calling me at work after school because he is watching TV in his room and refuses to make himself avaliable to them. The house is a complete disaster as well. [/INST]  Your husband is in serious denial and so are you. He’s pretending he doesn’t have responsibilities as a husband and father. You are pretending that you can keep your financial boat afloat by throwing money at the situation. It isn’t working. It’s as if you are trying to fill a pitcher that has a hole in the bottom. Of even more concern is that you are in denial about the care your children are getting from him. This isn’t a safe or healthy situation for them.I absolutely sympathize with the stress that unemployment can put on a guy. But the answer is not to sink the family. He could be giving you the emotional and practical support you need to provide for the family. Yes, it is a reversal of the traditional roles. But having one parent at home and one parent providing is a model that women have accepted and done well for generations and more and more men are embracing. It’s a model that can and does work. If he can’t find a job, your husband needs to do the job of taking care of the house and children so that you can perform well. As many, many men and women can tell him, that can be as rewarding and dignfying as any employment.Your husband is too depressed to make a change so it’s up to you. For the sake of all your children, including the baby to come, separate your money. The money your husband has wasted could have gone to good childcare and some household help. Give him a modest allowance but that’s it, no exceptions, until he becomes a solid contributing partner. Make sure you are not responsible for any credit cards he has in his possession. You may need to see a lawyer to make sure you are not left holding the bag if he defaults on his financial obligations. Demand that your husband get into serious treatment, take his medications, and put himself on a money diet. He should probably sell some of the cars and stay out of the bars. Without money, he won’t be able to escape the reality that he is in serious trouble. When you stop cooperating with his denial, he’ll be less able to keep up the pretense of being among the privileged rich.If your husband can’t or won’t man up, you have difficult decisions to make. Your first obligation is to the safety and welfare of your kids.I realize that it’s terribly hard to make ultimatums to someone you love. But without a cold splash of reality, there is no reason for your husband to change. Wake up and get busy. Your new baby as well as your older kids deserve to have a more relaxed mom and a more responsible dad.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My father is a very angry person. Mainly he is so worried about being successful in his job that he finds this an excuse to turn the whole house into a tension area. He isn’t alcoholic, physically abusive or anything, but his father is physical and I am afraid that he is walking in the same footsteps, since he is getting worse and worse every day. I sometimes get adrenaline when I remember him (I moved out) and mom is kind of sad these days. Anyway now that I moved to my grandparents for free food lol, I am seeing a horrible resemblance between abusive granddad and daddy, so I want to stop him, but he finds it insulting when I say, go to the doctor. Next weekend, I am going to psychiatrist and whatever drug he gives me I’ll slip it into his tea or whatever. If he finds out, he’ll hate me forever. Should I do it? Also mom knows about this plan and isn’t 100% with me on it, but I want to end the cycle, because my uncle is very paranoid and my brother will be too, also I feel sometimes this way. (Age 17, from Egypt) [/INST] A:  I think it is a very bad idea to give your father medication that is not prescribed for him. It is definitely not the correct way to handle the situation and could get you in trouble, and it’s not the best way to end the cycle. Instead of telling your father what he needs to do … like “go to the doctor,” try telling him how his anger makes you feel. Empower your mother to talk to her husband about her feelings as well, but even that is her choice, not yours. You have moved out from the home so it is really an issue your parents need to deal with themselves. You have every right to set boundaries with your father if he is disrespectful or overly aggressive toward you, but you cannot force him to change if he does not want to or doesn’t see the problem. Set your personal boundaries, try to understand his stress and anger, give him feedback on how he makes you feel and focus on breaking the cycle yourself.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] Alright this is the briefest explanation i can give. My mother is crazy and has effectively at every turn over the course of my life is responsible for countless issues. Very violently physically and emotionally abusive my existence under her was comparable to hell. She’s had me arrested, tossed into mental institutions and run me through several different therapists and so forth as i went through my stage of youthful rebellion in a direct attempt to subvert her (at the time i believed merely illogical) behavior. I learned of her pyschosis after being arrested due to a lie she told the police by a court ordered therapist my mother had seen for a brief period of time due to unrelated incidence. I was enlisted in the marine corps and her getting me arrested prevented me from fulfilling my enlistment, this is but one example of a time she crushed my hopes and options for my future. The day after my highschool graduation she put me out on the street because i failed to get a computer that lacked wi-fi connectivity to connect to wireless internet. My father is also a hopeless drug addict. This is a brief background of my lifes great struggle now i find myself lacking the motivation to do anything at all from getting out of bed to showering and everything inbetween i desperately require assistance to discover a means of regaining my motivation and getting my life back on track. [/INST]  I am not certain that a lack of motivation is your main problem. More likely it is the fact that you are dealing with very challenging life circumstances. According to your letter, you have no home, no job and no support from your family. Both your mother and father are unstable. The problem is not you; it is your life circumstances. Faced with such circumstances, virtually anyone would be struggling.I would encourage you to contact your local community mental health center. They can assist you in the following ways: helping you to find housing, a job, income assistance and by referring you to the appropriate mental health professionals.Having a secure place to live is a basic life necessity. Without it, it’s nearly impossible to focus on other areas of your life. I hope that you will consider my advice and contact your local community mental health center.

"<s>[INST] Ever since I was about twelve, and possibly earlier (I remember pretending to be a mouse that was being suffocated to death by a snake when I was around nine), I have had sexual fantasies about being kidnapped and tortured… For a long time they bothered me and I was worried there was something seriously wrong with me, up until I discovered that there’s a whole S&M community… But I’m still somewhat worried and very curiously about what can stem these ideas, especially at such a young age. I didn’t have any kind of abusive childhood, the only unusual occurrence growing up was that I was raised by my father, who was widowed, since the age of three. Throughout my school years, however, I was harassed and picked on by my classmates, I don’t know if that has anything to do with it. I hope I can get some kind of answer for where these feelings come from, then maybe I won’t feel so guilty or wonder what exactly is wrong with me. [/INST] No one is sure from where masochism originates. What is known is that females commonly engage in sexual fantasies much like what you have described and males to a lesser degree. Research shows that one of the most frequent sexual fantasies reported by women is that of being overpowered or forced to do something against their will. Studies also show that among women who have forced sex fantasies, there does not seem to be a link between their thoughts and real-world behavior. What this means is that those women who entertain forced sex fantasies do not typically attempt to engage in the activity. The thoughts arise for the sole purpose of fantasy or to enhance their sexual pleasure.Studies of force fantasies among women also show that those who engage in these fantasies tend to be more sexually open. This may mean that those who have force fantasies feel less guilt regarding sexuality. From a mental health perspective, those who are more open-minded and psychologically healthy are less likely to be constrained by guilt and thus may be more likely to engage in ideas or fantasies of a masochism or sadomasochism nature. According to human sexuality researchers, this is one theory used to explain why some women engage in masochism-themed fantasies.Another theory is that females who have been sexually abused may be more likely to engage in force fantasies than females who were not sexually abused. This does not mean that only or all women who have experienced sexual abuse have forced sex fantasies. It only means that there may be a greater incidence of these types of fantasies among sexually abused women. Regarding your specific situation, you said that you were never sexually abused. Because of this, it seems that your fantasies are not based on past sexual abuse. Research has shown that non-sexually abused women engage in forced sex fantasies as well.You mentioned that you feel guilt about your thoughts regarding forced sex. It may be that the guilt you feel stems from the belief that “something is wrong with you.” While you may never know the origin of your fantasies, one thing seems certain, based on scientific, human sexuality research, not only are your fantasies “normal” but they’re relatively common.Hopefully, knowing this information can help you stop feeling guilty about your fantasies. You should feel free to think or fantasize about anything you want. Remember they’re only thoughts. You never mentioned that you were attempting to or that you had a desire to live out your fantasy. If you did write this, I might have a different response for you. It would be unhealthy for you to place limits on what it is that you let yourself think.I would recommend that you read more about this subject. There are many academic studies conducted regarding masochism or sadomasochism. There are also many other books written on the subject. One great resource on the Internet is the Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality (SSSS). Thanks for your question. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve been depressed for most of my life, but within the last couple of years, I’ve been clinically depressed. During this period, I’ve not had many days where I feel content. For the past couple of months, I have been wondering why I’m even alive. My problem is I don’t feel I belong here. I don’t fit in anywhere. I’ve got issues from my past that I cannot let go of, and I don’t know how to move on. Actually, I don’t feel I can move on. I feel disconnected from family, which I don’t know why. All I can think of is that I’m a bad person. I don’t feel like my mom loves or likes me. I could be wrong, but that is how I feel. I think that maybe she doesn’t forgive me for certain things, but she has forgiven my brother for the very same wrongs. I just don’t feel human. I feel if my own mom can’t like me, never wants to see me happy, then I must be an awful person. I feel like as long as I’m living how she thinks I should live, then it’s ok with her that I am miserable in life. I don’t even believe she would care if I died. And this is not the only issue. I just don’t like myself. I am never as good as anyone else. Things that other people deserve , I don’t deserve them. I don’t even feel in control of my own life. This is what hurts the most. I feel I am better off dead. I feel like if I’m having so many issues, can’t be who I need to be to be accepted at least by my mom, then I don’t need to be here. I’m worthless, and I don’t think I’ll ever feel differently. My soul, mind, everything has been completely shattered beyond repair. I can’t ever heal from everything I’ve been through. I can’t ask for help from anyone because it may be wrong that I’m going to strangers as opposed to family, even though other family members have friends that they can talk to. I mean nothing to anyone and I just don’t want to go on anymore. Not like this. I don’t know how to change me to where life is comfortable for me. I don’t know what to do anymore. My heart is telling me that life is over for me. That I should just die. Please help me understand how to live with everything I have on my plate. Thanks. [/INST]  You have been dealing with depression for most of your life but it seems that you have yet to receive professional help. You should not have waited. Depression is a very treatable condition.Lately, you’ve noticed it’s getting worse. It’s gotten to the point where you don’t think life is worth living. It’s important to understand that depression can cloud judgment. Much of what has led you to feel as though life is not worth living is based on your feeling that you don’t belong, that your mother doesn’t love you and that no one would care if you ceased to exist.There is a high probability that your judgment about how your family feels about you and how you perceive yourself is wrong because of your depression. You don’t feel like your mother loves you but what is that feeling based on? What evidence do you have to support your ideas? What you feel to be true and what you fear might be true may not match up with what is true.You also don’t think you’re as “good as anyone else.” That is how depressed people feel. They don’t think they’re worthy of life and they often deem themselves as being worthless. They often feel that there is no hope for them. But they are wrong, very wrong.It is vitally important that you consult a mental health professional as soon as possible. The major concern is your not wanting to live. If you feel that you might harm yourself, then go to the emergency room or call 911 immediately. Many people with depression feel the way you do. They don’t feel that life is worth living and they don’t feel hopeful. Once they begin treatment, they quickly realize just how clouded their judgment had been. They begin to see that their lives can improve.You shouldn’t have waited so long to receive help. The moment that you suspected depression is when you should have sought professional treatment.If you are open to treatment, there is a great deal of hope for you. I suspect that much of what you believe to be true about yourself is the result of an inaccurate perception of reality. Therapy can help you see the truth and live a good life. I wish you the best of luck and hope that you will take my advice and seek help immediately. Please take care. </s>"

This is evidenced by the fact that you have not showered in a month and cannot leave your bedroom. Other very concerning symptoms include: hallucinations, insomnia, extreme anger and irritability, cutting, hopelessness and the lack of a support system. It seems as though your home environment may be significantly contributing to the problem. The hospital could provide a much needed reprieve from an unstable and unsupportive home environment.You should go to the emergency room and report all the symptoms that you wrote about in this letter. Even if you do not have health insurance, given your symptoms, you are likely to be admitted. The hospital has an obligation to admit individuals who pose an imminent danger to themselves or to others. Once in the hospital, you can work with a doctor who can prescribe medication that will help to decrease your symptoms. You will also have the opportunity to work with a therapist and a social worker. The social worker can assist you with a comprehensive aftercare plan including follow-up care, the acquisition of health coverage, housing assistance, as well as any other practical and immediate needs that you may have.If you do not wish to go to the hospital, then call your local community mental health center (CMHC) and ask for their assistance. They can provide similar services to that of a hospital social worker. CMHCs also have therapists on staff who can provide counseling. You can also call the local health department and ask what type of services may be available to individuals who do not have health insurance.The CMHC or the local health department may be of assistance with regard to locating mental health services but I would recommend more immediate assistance. It is important to recognize when immediate help is appropriate. Given your symptoms, I would advise that you go to a hospital for an evaluation. Call 911 if you feel that you cannot get yourself to the emergency room. You need and deserve help. I hope you’re able to get the help that you need. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’m a 25 year-old male whose father and cousins have/had schizophrenia. I recently moved to Oregon, where marijuana is a legal drug, so I partake recreationally (3-4 times a week). I just started smoking marijuana when I was 24, and really didn’t make it a regular thing until I was 25. I’ve always had a slight fear of having schizophrenia, as I’ve studied mental illness since it’s been a very big part of my life. Recently, however, I feel those feelings have been slightly amplified due to the correlative nature between schizophrenia and marijuana usage displayed in medical and psychological studies. I’ve noticed myself becoming paranoid when under the influence (a common thing, I know). That paranoia usually subsides after I rest, along with the influence of the drug. That being said, I’ve been having some thoughts of being able to change the world. These thoughts occur heavily when I’m high, but also sometimes happen when I’m sober (only much less intense), and usually come in the form of being able to educate people about empathy and kindness (since I’m a teacher and an actor). I’ve also had moments where I try to empathize with people in order to understand what they’re thinking, and maybe even try to “read their thoughts” in order to better connect with them. Do I truly believe I can? No. But I do think I can come close to identify how their feeling in order to better help them with their problems. I can, somewhat frequently, also have quick mood changes into anger depending on circumstances; they usually happen when I’m driving or when I have a lot of stress in my life. [/INST]  Just because marijuana is legal for recreational purposes doesn’t mean you should partake in it. Alcohol is also legal, but if you drank three or four times a week it could be disastrous for your physical and mental health. It’s a bad idea.Marijuana is a drug that continues to be categorized by the federal government as a schedule I drug. Schedule I drugs are considered dangerous. As you have read in the medical literature, marijuana is also linked to psychosis. That fact is based on scientific studies. Those studies also note that having a family history of schizophrenia can increase the possibility of offspring developing the disease. Given your family history, that is not a fact you should ignore.Your main question is should you be concerned about having unusual experiences while under the influence of marijuana? The answer is yes. Your concerns are valid and should prompt you to stop using drugs immediately.Marijuana alters one’s brain chemistry and can cause irreparable damage. Not everyone who uses marijuana will experience problems, but it increases the risk of negative outcomes. Anecdotally, I receive many letters from people who smoke marijuana and develop side effects that never seem to go away. Derealization and paranoia are quite common. It would be wise to quit while you are ahead.It’s also important to address the fact that you should not need drugs to be happy. Psychologically healthy people, don’t need to get high to feel good. You might consider counseling to explore why you feel the need to use drugs. Maybe you use marijuana to decrease stress but there are certainly many other healthy ways to relax that do not involve risking your mental health.Counseling could help you address your drug problem. If you are using it for stress reduction, you might try meditation instead. A growing number of studies have demonstrated its significantly positive physiological and psychological benefits. I hope I’ve helped. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Hi there, I’m torn between accepting or rejecting a diagnosis of Bipolar II. A clinical psychologist diagnosed me with Bipolar II a week ago and now I am under a primary care physician to receive mood stabilizing medication this week. I don’t think I have bipolar disorder though. Can personality not sometimes resemble bipolar? I am sometimes hyperactive and able to take on a 100 projects, feel super smart and pretty and am at the top of my game. I need little sleep and in fact find sleep an annoying timewaster. Then I have times, probably more often, where I feel sorry for myself, feel ugly, stupid and can barely clean my flat or look after my pets. When I’m hyper, I harm no one, I don’t spend too much or gamble or drink or do anything that could be considered damaging. I just work really hard, accomplish a lot (I work fulltime as a project manager, am a freelance educational writer and am in the third year of a science degree for which I have had 18 distinctions so far). When I am down, I do feel very sad and think of killing myself every now and then, but I would never kill myself as I know logically this would be stupid and that I always feel better again. In my mind, I am just a highly functional individual who is able to achieve a lot, use my time to the max, sometimes feeling on the top of the world and sometimes not. I’m used to feeling like this and I have all sorts of coping mechanisms around it. I am completely alone, no family and few uninvolved friends, so my state of mood never affects anyone. I also have no support structure should it really be bipolar and should I need help. I don’t understand why I should go on mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. I’ve had no breaks with reality, just a few very minor private breakdowns where I have cried a lot. But I got over those and I was just overworked and under a lot of pressure and it didn’t affect anyone other than me. What do you do when you are torn between accepting a diagnosis and thinking it is total nonsense? I change my mind at least 20 times a day. I can’t imagine I will be able to be compliant with taking medication or accepting help. (age 38, from South Africa) [/INST]  Based on what you have described here, I tend to agree with the diagnosis that the psychologist has given you. It does sound like you meet the criteria. Most people experience some ups and downs, and yes, some personalities can include some opposing traits and tendencies, but the swings that you mention here do hit some of the classic extremes that are included in Bipolar Disorder and/or Cyclothymic Disorder.However, just because you meet the criteria for a disorder does not mean that you need to be medicated for it (or even treated). If you feel that you truly have the coping skills already in place to manage your mood and energy changes, you don’t have to pursue further treatment. But the fact that you consulted with a psychologist in the first place and state that you don’t have a support structure to rely on, indicates that you could at least benefit from the help of a therapist.Most people with Bipolar love their highs and hate their lows, so you are not alone in this aspect. Deciding how much the mood changes impact your life and your ability to function, as well as affecting your “quality of life,” will help you with the decision to medicate. Mood stabilizers will not change your personality, they will level out the highs and lows so that you have more consistency in your state of being. But you have every right to seek a second opinion if you are still struggling with the decision whether or not to pursue further treatment. I hope this information helps.All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have big goals, big dreams, big hopes for the future. I’ve built my life on working toward accomplishing these dreams. I’m generally a really optimistic, ambitious person. Anything I set my mind to, I succeed at in some way. [/INST]  You are obviously an intelligent and motivated woman who’s taken many steps to be successful in the workplace, so it makes sense that being unemployed and having multiple book rejections would be totally discouraging! It sounds to me like living at home isn’t helping either. Have you asked for your mom specifically for empathy and emotionally support? I suggest you let her know exactly what you’re looking for, even giving her the exact words, when you share your struggles with her. You mentioned that she’s the “only” one you have to talk to – why is that?I suggest that the first step you take is to branch out socially so you have additional support during this difficult time.  Try getting involved in some community groups that interest you, like book groups or hiking groups, for example.  Consider spending some time volunteering. Look for ways to broaden your circle of associates and friends beyond you mother.Since your current employment efforts aren’t going as planned, it might be time to get more creative in your problem solving by taking your passions, gifts, and training, and refocusing them temporarily. Here are a few examples of what I’m talking about.Housing: What about looking for a housing situation where you manage an apartment complex in exchange for rent, or you check in on an elderly person in exchange for living in a basement apartment?Employment: What about applying to non-teaching jobs while you’re waiting for the right teaching opportunity to come along? Any job will allow you to save money and move out on your own so you’re not “stuck” living with your mom. Consider refocusing your teaching experience by developing a course for community education classes in the evenings, for example.Writing: How about taking your love of writing and looking into writing a column for a local newspaper or website while you’re waiting for opportunities to get your book published? Have you looked into self-publishing options?My personal and professional experiences have taught me that, even when things don’t go as planned, no life experience is ever wasted. Many professional opportunities I’ve had have come through developing a network of personal and professional relationships that have opened up doors that I didn’t even know existed. As you expand social circles you’ll be developing key relationships that will likely open doors for you, too.Thanks for writing in.

"<s>[INST] I met my boyfriend on a social media site 6 months ago and we fell quickly and deeply in love. He lives in the U.S. And I in the UK and I’m planning a trip to meet him in the next month or so. I have never felt more cherished and more connected to anyone and 90% of the time things are wonderful but I’m plagued with insecurities. [/INST]  I am happy for you that you have met someone that brings so much excitement and joy to your life. While long distance relationships can work the insecurities you describe seem to be growing. Maybe because of this you can use some reflective distance to gain perspective. It sounds as if this relationship exists virtually and that you haven’t been in each others physical presence. If you have been chatting for six months and feel a deep connection this is wonderful — but long distance relationships often serve a purpose in that the distance itself is part of the formula for what makes it work. The longing — wanting but not having — becomes part of the dynamic. There are several reasons for why this can happen, but it isn’t an uncommon occurrence.What you are feeling is the potential of the relationship — the promise — not the reality. The reality is you feel good but you’ve never met him; absorbed in love and insecure; excited and worried. The hope is that the relationship can live up to the potential.Don’t jump too far ahead of yourself. While it is wonderful to be in love there are many surveys that show the first part of a relationship can inflate our view and expectations. Give this both time and perspective. Meet him, spend some time in his world, and have him spend some time in yours. Until you interact with each other in person you are projecting a future based on too little information.If he can’t seem to make time for you because of his work, what will it be like when you are actually in his world? Stay hopeful, but give yourself a chance to look past the potential to the reality of what is. Take each phase of this relationship with equal doses of love, hope — and a clear-headed reality.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a woman in the U.S.: My boyfriend has a 13 yr who is very clingy to him. She’s had instances where she would call her mother while she is at our house and cry when she doesn’t get her way. This of course would spark and argument with between her and my boyfriend. Of course when we first started dating she felt like he was spending too much time with me and my kids. So I felt the need to step back and let him handle that supposedly gain control of the situation. It seems to be there is an issue that arises every couple months where she gets upset with him about something that involves me and my kids. I can”t stand when she comes around and I can tell he knows how I feel. I’m on the verge of calling it quits. I don’t know what else to do. [/INST] What you are reporting isn’t unusual. Dating someone with children from a prior relationship is almost always very difficult, especially if they are teens. The daughter is not going to go away. She undoubtedly senses that you don’t want her around. This probably escalates her insecurities and sets off the behaviors you find so difficult.If you don’t find a way to be comfortable with her, your relationship with her dad won’t survive. Why? Because your boyfriend can’t be put in the position of feeling like he has to choose between his child and you. The loyalty to the child usually wins. In fact, it should.The girl is just entering her teens. This is a life stage when life becomes complicated. Remember being a teen? It’s normal for a teen to both want to be close to her parents and to want to distance from them. For young teens who are dealing with emerging sexuality, it’s not at all unusual for them to cling to the parent of the other sex for awhile. It’s a way to “try on” being in a relationship that is (hopefully) sexually safe. If that’s part of what is happening, the girl may see you as “competition” for closeness with her dad.In addition, If she had hopes that her dad and mom would get together again (and most kids wish for that, even when the parents were always fighting or worse), your presence signals that it isn’t going to happen. Furthermore, many kids get clingy when they are worried that their parent will “divorce” them too.To answer your question: What you do is learn more about how to manage the challenges of blending a family, especially when one of the people is a teenage girl. The girl is not the problem. Your information gap is. My guess is that lacking information causes your anxiety. The anxiety makes it difficult for you to be compassionate and probably makes you want her to go away.I strongly suggest that you and your boyfriend go for a few sessions with a licensed family therapist (LMFT) to learn more about your situation and to learn ways to handle the girl with sensitivity and understanding. You do need to go together. Blending a family is a problem for both adults — even if one doesn’t feel he/she has a problem. Hopefully, you and her dad can learn ways to be supportive of all the children (yours as well as his) so that together you can build a solid blended family.I wish you well. </s>"
"<s>[INST] Two weeks ago my wife said that she wanted to try a separation to find herself. I have not been doing the things she needs and treating her the way I should. Well it’s been two weeks, I still pay all the bills and am living with a friend. She has both of the kids, but I talk to them nightly. I want to move back home, even if it is in the other room. I miss my kids and my wife…and I’d like to come home. How long should I wait until I tell her I am moving home and if she needs more space then she needs to go somewhere else? [/INST] I’m sorry you and your wife are going through a rough patch. Most marriages do have ups and downs. Hopefully, by working this through together, you will come out stronger in time. The key word in that last sentence is “together”. I know you miss your kids. I know you want to be home. It’s honorable that you continue to pay the bills to support your children. But working this through means talking to her about how you feel, not simply “telling” her, as this implies you are not soliciting an engaged conversation. Working together is key in a partnership such as marriage.You and your wife need to figure out why it is that you have not been treating your wife as you should and why she thinks that she can’t ‘find herself’ within the marriage. You need to work together to regain the love and interest and attention that has somehow been lost along the way.According to Family Education website: “When a married couple decides to separate, the people in their lives often see it as the first step toward divorce. However, this isn’t necessarily the case. Some couples find that a temporary separation is just what they needed to work on their marriage and reconnect, while others might find that just remaining separated without ever taking that further step into divorce suits them just fine. It really all depends on the couple and what they come to realize is best for them.”“Separation, physical or legal, doesn’t always lead to divorce. Sometimes separation can be a time of forgiveness and renewed commitment. Many couples separate in hopes of saving a marriage, and sometimes, that can work. After all, just getting distance from a painful, antagonistic situation can provide you with enough perspective to come back together weeks or months later and sort things out.”“We often view separation as a trial period that either ends in reconnection or divorce, but in some marriages, separation — rather than divorce — becomes a permanent way of life. For some, divorce holds nothing positive. It would erode their joint fortune and diminish the money available to their children.”The separation will only help if you two work together to make significant and important changes. Some people can do that after a break of only a few days. And, in other cases, some people need a long time. It’s not the length of time that ensures success, but rather, it’s the quality of work you do. If you can’t do the work together on your own, please make sure to contact a couples therapist to help you learn how to communicate better and how to treat each other well and with respect.Please make the effort, as it is important both for you as individuals and the health of your marriage, as well as for the two children you have brought into the world.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] From a 15 year old boy in Australia: Ever since I was a very small child I’ve felt disengaged from everyone else, as a 6-10 year old only having perhaps one real friend who I very rarely spent time with and many more friends that seemed very real to me but were in fact figments of my imagination I suppose. As well as this I spent most of my time reading. I think this may be built around the sexual abuse from an older boy who I thought I was one of my best friends, or my parents divorce. This has also affected my ability to trust people in my life now. [/INST]  I’m very glad you wrote. I can’t, of course, provide a diagnosis on the basis of such a short letter. What I can do is strongly urge you to see a therapist who can do exactly that. You need a professional evaluation to determine if your symptoms are an outcome of trauma, a mental disorder or your sleep disorder. There are also signs that you should be evaluated for possibly being on the autism spectrum.In my opinion, you have suffered much too long. You deserve the treatment that can help you settle down and live a happier and more constructive life. You deserve to feel better, to have friends and to get a good night’s sleep every night.Treatment works! But treatment is only effective if it is targeted to what is wrong.You made an important step toward health and well-being by writing to us here at PsychCentral. Now do the next step. Make an appointment, today if you can, with a therapist who specializes in teen issues. A therapist will be able to hear your entire story and then make both a diagnosis and a treatment plan. You have nothing to lose except a few hours of your time. You have everything to gain.If you aren’t sure how to find a therapist, talk to your parents, your doctor, your school counselor or a teacher your trust. And do take your letter and this response with you to the first appointment. It will help you get started.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been dating this guy for 5months, and unlike what I had before, there was no honeymoon period. He seems to be a person who likes alot of personal time, while I thrive on closeness with my partner. So we’ve been rather distant to begin with, and he says its good to take things slow and have personal space. [/INST]  From what you have written he has made work his priority. This is not your “own doing.” If you had it your way, you and he would spend more time together. He tells you repeatedly that he’s going to change. You said it best: he is “basically a lot of talk without action.”Not many people would be willing to tolerate “a lot of talk without action” for very long, especially in a new relationship. You seem to have given him sufficient opportunities to change his behavior, yet he has not.From your letter, it seems as though you and he have already parted ways and you are considering whether or not to give him another chance. Only you can answer that question but before you do, have an honest discussion with him about the various problems you have had with the relationship. If you don’t, and you decide to give him another chance, then he will likely continue the same behavior. If he can get away with “all talk and no action” his track record shows that he probably will.If you decide to reconcile, inform him that he will have to prove that he can change by actually changing. Be specific about how you want him to change. The more specific you can be about the needed changes, the more success that is possible for the relationship.To the question of cheating, it’s not clear from your letter that he is. Having friends on Facebook with people you disapprove of does not equate to cheating. Nor is it necessarily a sign of betrayal. Hiding his friends list would be a form of betrayal. He is not hiding his friends from you.Having said that, since you expressed your dissatisfaction and he continues to keep his Facebook friends, then this could be a problem for the relationship. If it’s a problem for one party in the relationship, then it’s a problem for both. The question then becomes should his having certain Facebook friends be a problem for you? Unfortunately that’s not something I can determine from a short letter. I would have to have much more information about why you see it as a problem before I could determine if your concerns are warranted.Gradually, you and he were spending less time together but it is difficult to determine why. It could have been the dynamic of the relationship. Early on in the relationship you and he were not spending much time together. As you stated, there was no “honeymoon period.” It might also have been a sign that the relationship was degrading. I believe that it might have been the latter but I can’t know for certain. The fact the you decided to end the relationship (at least temporarily) also supports the idea that the relationship wasn’t going well.“Should you take him back?” is your primary question and regrettably I can’t answer that for you. If he is unwilling to change and he continues to put all of his needs before yours, then no, you should not take him back. A one-sided relationship would be unhealthy and unsatisfying. Relationships need to be balanced. If you continue to struggle with how to approach this relationship, then you may want to consult a therapist.

"<s>[INST] Even in the absence of conflict, my partner is unable to engage in deep conversation or to express his thoughts and feelings verbally. This has caused multiple relationships to fail in his life and he desperately wishes that kind of communication was available to him. He is an amazing listener, very open-hearted and present, but cannot engage in two-sided conversation unless it’s small talk. He doesn’t understand why this is the case and has experienced this since childhood. When he is asked for verbal feedback, he experiences obvious physiological symptoms of stress (sweating, elevated heart rate, possibly tearfulness as his non-communication is a trigger for having experienced a lot of pain from loss of relationships for this reason). He has said that he experiences his feelings more in terms of colors and shapes than in describable words, which obviously contributes to a communication issue that is certain to end our relationship too if left as is. He is interested in trying to understand what’s happening for him and becoming communicative, but has never had a practice of self-reflection or access of counseling or therapy. I love him and feel invested in giving him room to figure this out. My communication skills are highly developed and this is a significant stress on our relationship as I am accustomed to being able to process and engage verbally in a deep way with those close to me. I am making an effort to find less verbal ways we can also connect so that I am also participating in his realm, but when it comes to the nuts and bolts of our relationship we need to be able to have two-way conversation, and I need to be able to get feedback and validation when I open myself up and discuss something with my partner. Do you have any suggestions for a good starting point for him as he begins the journey of trying to unravel this? Whether or not our relationship can be saved, I want to support his desire to make this change for his own life and ability to connect with people. Thank you so much. [/INST]  It sounds as though he might be experiencing anxiety and/or panic attacks. Anxiety and panic are highly treatable. I suggest that he begin counseling. You and he might also be good candidates for couples counseling. As long as he is willing to participate in treatment and sticks with it, for however long it is necessary, expect a positive outcome.The fact that you’re asking for help on his behalf is a bit concerning because it would suggest that you might be trying to “fix” him. You can’t do the work for him. Your support is undoubtedly essential in assisting him through the process of change but he has to want to change and agree to participate in treatment. As long as he is willing and able to participate in treatment, there is hope for change.Another suggestion you can make is his reading self-help books about communication skills, relationships and anxiety disorders. Books are a good resource for education but therapy is the most efficient way to correct these issues. Continue to be supportive, suggest counseling and hope that he is willing to participate in treatment. I wish you both the best of luck. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I was recently married and we have a four month old baby. My husband has said/done some mean things to my parents that he has apologized for, but he is very vocal and feels that noone deserves respect unless they earn it. We were house hunting this weekend and my mother came to watch the baby. We do not live in the safest neighborhood so she bolted the door and we do not have a key to it. We came home and she was feeding the baby, it took her about 2 minutes to get the door. My husband flipped called her a f— moron and told her it was completely disrespectful. Am I wrong for getting mad at him considering it was our apartment? Then he called me a f— retard. I told him if he didn’t apologize to my mom then we were never going to work and he should leave for a few days. He called my mom and apologized through voicemail, but the damage is done, my parents are telling me he’s no good and to leave him and my husband is concerned with our family and wants our family to work. I don’t know what to do. My husband never wants to see them again, hence they cannot come to where we live for dinner or anything. His parents live two hours away, mine live 30 minutes. I don’t know what to do, my parents aren’t speaking to me because I still let him live with us. (FYI-he had a huge tax bill and he just finished paying it off, but I have paid for everything the past six months including the apt we live in now). Please help. [/INST]  Let’s review: Your mother comes to help you out by going to your apartment and, because she locks the door for her safety and has to manage the child as she comes to unlock the door, she is verbally abused by your husband. Further, instead of being grateful, he gets angry and verbally abuses you. More than that, he doesn’t apologize directly – he leaves a voicemail, and only because you’ve threatened him.The money and anger issues paint a picture that suggests you should see someone at the local women’s center for legal and therapeutic help. The fact that he has not managed money well, that you had to pay for everything, that he can’t regulate his anger, can’t be thankful for what others are doing to help, and isn’t invested in fixing these things isn’t a hopeful sign for the relationship as you have presented it.I would find out how to protect yourself financially and emotionally and what your options are for dealing with a man with these issues.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I’ve always been a bit weird with social interaction. Sometimes I’ll have days where I need to recharge after being around people too much, be too scared to talk to people, or more simply be content eith being alone. Though recently I’ve been hating social interaction and have felt completely numb in general. Then when I don’t feel numb, I distrust and don’t want to be close to people I trust dearly. Or I simply just want them away from me for no reason. So I’m either aggressive, numb, or randomly anxious that I’m being too distant or too abrasive. [/INST] A. You might try keeping a journal where you document the changes you are noticing. That might help to pinpoint the problem, if any.It’s also important to remember that this may be temporary. Moods change and its normal to feel a range of emotions, they fluctuate. Perhaps you feel a particular way after interacting with certain people. Maybe it’s worse after you have had a rough day at school or watch a particular program or listen to a specific song. Journaling might help you to uncover patterns in your feelings and moods.If this continues to be a problem, I would recommend counseling. It is ideal for these types of issues. Counseling offers many great benefits, the most obvious being the objectivity of the therapist. An objective, trained, third-party can sometimes see problems where we can’t.Finally, please know that you deserve to be helped. There’s no reason in the world why you are not deserving of help. Those types of feelings are likely contributing to what may be wrong. Counseling can eradicate these types of negative thoughts. Thanks for your question. Please take care. </s>"

I am stuck in a constant state of anxiety, and can’t find anyone to see me anytime soon. Where can I find free or medicaid covered help fast? [/INST] You might try going to your local community mental health center or local mental health hospital. Sometimes, churches offer free or low-cost services to individuals with psychological problems.There also might be support groups in your area. Two to consider are grief support groups and The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) support groups. For the former, Google “grief support groups and [the name of your town]” into a search. Regarding the latter, Google “NAMI” and you should find information about both their national organization and their local support groups.Another idea is the contact your insurance company and ask for their assistance. Depending on your employer, you might have access to employee assistance programs where you can receive immediate psychological assistance.Another possibility includes searching for local universities and whether or not they offer free psychological health clinics. Research universities are also often conducting studies and need participants. You may be eligible for one of their studies and in the process, receive psychological treatment. Some of their treatments are cutting-edge and quite effective.One final idea is to contact your primary care physician and ask for their assistance. They might prescribe medication, at least temporarily, to help get you through this very difficult and emotional time. The medication might help to ease your emotional pain while awaiting your counseling appointment.I hope these ideas help in some small way.

Even my bf said I looked dead it took about 2 hours for me to slowly start moving and talking. I remember I was able to see and hear everything but I couldn’t do anything. Eventually I became very scared of what was going on to me and I started crying and he told me it might be a way that my body just shut down so I wasn’t able to feel anymore.

"<s>[INST] I’m writing because my boyfriend and I have a lot of problems in the one year we’ve been together. Six months ago we went on a “break” because I wanted to live with him but he didn’t want to live with me. Even though I didn’t want to end it, the arguments we had over the living together issue seemed to push him to the point of wanting to leave. [/INST]  Thank you for asking. It is a tough question because of the way you received the information. But you know that already, and the details are too intense to ignore. First let me say something about how men talk to other men about women they are involved with. Men who respect and love their wives and girlfriends see the relationship as an extension of themselves. They don’t trash a woman they love. They might be upset, confused, frustrated, angry, and talk to their friends about what to do, but they don’t go trashing a woman they care deeply about. That tends to happen when there is little or no commitment.It sounds to me like your boyfriend may not be mature enough for a commitment. But the real question is what do you want to do about this? He has secrets from you and now you do from him.Couples counseling may be important because if you decide to confront him about reading the emails you can have the advantage of a professional there to guide you through. The risk of not confronting him is that you will carry a resentment. Individual counseling would be important for coping with that.

"<s>[INST] from New Zealand: Two years ago I became very anxious and suicidally depressed. I attempted suicide 3 times, the last time while hospitalised. I am ‘lucky’ to be alive after a fairly lethal attempt. Prior to that I had no psychiatric history. [/INST]  Once someone has been seriously suicidal (or been close to someone who has suicided), ending life becomes more of a real option. You’ve already faced the prospect of death and decided several times that your misery in life outweighed whatever fear you had of death. The fear of the unknown of death is an inhibitor to suicide for most people. It’s not there in the same way for you. (The same thing happens for some people when they survive a life-threatening illness or accident. Death just isn’t so scary any more.) There is a kind of peace that comes with that but it also puts you at more risk.With all you’ve been through, it’s not too surprising that you’ve developed a sleep disorder but it certainly isn’t helping things. Sleep deprivation makes people feel fragile and vulnerable. My guess is that it takes all the strength and concentration you’ve got to hold it together all day at work. Of course you fall apart on your way home. It also makes sense to me that you can’t read for pleasure. By the time you’ve taken care of your patients and your kids, you’ve about used up your ability to focus for the day.That you even entertain going back to a husband who demonstrates signs of being a habitual abuser worries me greatly. Although this is common among wives who’ve been on the emotional roller coaster of an abusive marriage, it does suggests that you still have some important work to do in therapy.You said you have been hospitalized. You didn’t mention whether you have had follow-up care. Continuing in therapy can help you work through your feelings of anxiety, guilt, and pain and will help you regain your self-esteem and confidence. You would probably also benefit from attending a support group for abused women or using one of the chatroom support communities.Please give yourself lots of credit. You’ve managed a job, kids, and your own inner turmoil for a long time. You’ve done it in spite of little sleep and lots of worries. You have a core of strength that maybe you didn’t know you have but you’re getting worn out. Regular, professional help will give you the added support you need until you replenish yourself. Write me in a month or two and let me know how it’s going.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I began to hear voices in my head at 24 years old which is weird because I have not had any psychotic mental history ever in my life until now. The voices sound real as if it is being transmitted to me and the voices are not loud it levels out to where I can never fully hear exactly what is being said, if I try too hard to listen it will go away but the more my mind drifts and pays attention to something else with the thought of hearing voices lurking in the back of my mind the voices come back, its as if who ever is transmitting this through to me is trying very hard to make me schizophrenic and appear as a schizophrenic person. I know I am not schizophrenic, I am pretty self aware of everything, I can separate imagination from reality but what is happening to me is full dead on real and I don’t know what to do about it or how it is being done I have been on psychotic medicine at least 4 none of them stop it I don’t think these voices are coming from my imagination I am very positive some how some way people are able to transmit voices in my head. [/INST]  The voices may seem real because they may be real. Though hearing voices is often a symptom of mental illness, it’s not always indicative of mental illness. It is estimated that up to 10% of the population regularly hears voices and are not mentally ill. Oliver Sacks, the famed neurologist, believes that hallucinations and hearing voices, for some people, constitute a “normal mode of experience.”Having said that, it would be advantageous if your symptoms were monitored by a mental health professional. The fact that you have been on antipsychotic medication in the past possibly indicates psychosis but further investigation is necessary.The bottom line is this: hearing voices may or may not indicate psychosis but if so, it’s imperative that you do everything in your power to prevent the development of a full-blown psychotic episode. It is important to be vigilant. Research shows that when it comes to psychosis, early intervention works, which is yet another reason to stay connected to mental health professionals. They can provide support, objective analysis of your symptoms and assist you in treating psychosis, should it develop. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have a way older sister that I am close to. We don’t live close, in fact, in different sides of the USA, but we are still kind of close to each other. We are close emotionally I mean, as sisters. Anyway, I have schizoaffective disorder and I have tried to talk to her about it. Although she doesn’t think I have it. We haven’t lived in the same house actually since she went off to college years ago before I got diagnosed. I got diagnosed at 17. We haven’t lived in the same house since I was 9, but we are still kind of close. We talk at least once a week a bit, sometimes more. I’ve become a lot more reclusive since I’ve been diagnosed and have kept and continue to keep things to myself. She believes I only suffer from depression or anxiety and has questioned whether I just make my, diagnosed, delusions up for attention. [/INST]  I think you are a resilient and brave person and it would behoove you to have either a family therapist or the doctor who diagnosed you to have a meeting with you and your sister. Involve any other family members who are interested so they can ask questions, get information and understand a little bit more about your struggle and courage in dealing with this. Having information coming from a professional is often a better way for family members to learn and understand.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] For nearly two years, I’ve dealt with increasingly worse anxiety symptoms. The biggest issue is my inability to sleep when I am away from home, including difficulties sleeping in my own dorm. I’ve dealt with these sleeping issues for over a year and generally find that when I can’t sleep, my mind focuses on all the things wrong with the room I’m in (too quiet, too hot, etc). I’m also constantly going through a mental list of assignments, meetings, and events, and rewriting the list in my planner each day. Usually, I just run through the list in my head, but I have also noticed that I will speak out loud to myself while walking to and from class and run through the list while making a plan of what order to complete those tasks. I’ll run through this order multiple times, typically until I get to wherever I’m going or encounter other people because I’m worried they will judge me for speaking to myself. Even when I’ve accomplished the tasks I set out to do on a particular day, I still find myself thinking about the items on that list and panicking about how much more I have to do. As a result, I feel as if I can never fully relax. I’m always worried that I’m going to forget something on that list and that something bad will happen because I don’t complete that particular thing. I also find that I have difficulty concentrating because I’m constantly thinking about these things. When I have difficulty concentrating and feel really anxious about something, generally experiencing a heavy feeling in my chest and difficulty breathing, I end up picking at the skin around my nails, and on particularly bad days, I do this until they bleed. Although I generally fear that others will judge me for my actions, I find that picking helps me calm down and refocus myself. While my worries about school are generally my main focus, I often find myself worrying about my relationships as well, particularly that my friends don’t really like me and that I don’t actually have feelings for my boyfriend. I’ve recently begun to fear that I have OCD rather than just anxiety. I’ve brought some of these topics up to my doctor, but should I voice my worries that the anxiety I experience seems to mirror some aspects of OCD? (From the USA) [/INST]   Thank you for having the bravery to talk about these anxieties. While it would not be possible for me to diagnose you over the internet, I can understand your concern. You may want to take our quiz for OCD here to see if it matches your experience.The key is in managing your anxiety and self-regulating your emotions. Here is a sample of techniques you can use to bring yourself under control. I would bring this up to your physician as he or she will be able to ask more detailed questions about your thoughts and feelings, and if appropriate, offer some suggestion for medication or additional forms of psychotherapy, like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) You may also want to try one of our forums to chat with others about your experience.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I don’t remember a time in my life where I’ve been totally happy but for the past approximately 2 years i have been extremely depressed as a result of my social anxiety and loneliness. I have always found social situations ‘awkward’, in fact the last time I remember frequently leaving my house for social reasons was when I was about 13. I then became more and more of a recluse from there on, i went out with my friends less and less outside of school, then upon leaving school i stopped doing things with my friends more and more until the point where i have not left my house for social reasons for about 2/3 years. I no longer have any friends and although my family is nice and supportive they cannot provide me with what I need. I have not spoken to anyone in person about my problems, I simply can’t. My parents will just tell me to go to a doctor. Doctors will just prescribe me with a drug that I don’t want. I don’t feel a psychiatrist can help me. I’ve become extremely lonely and depressed. My self esteem is extremely low and although I’m not a bad looking person I simply cannot accept my imperfections, no matter how hard I’ve tried. I feel I am in so deep that I cannot make a recovery. I cannot throw myself into social activities to make friends because of my social anxiety. I no longer find anything enjoyable and nothing at all interests me, this leaves me with the motivation to try nothing. I feel like I’m in a corner with no way out, every possible path I need to take to fix myself, I cant bring myself to walk down whether its my self esteem, depression or social anxiety stopping me. I hate it and I hate the person I am, I’m so sad it hurts. I feel so lost and lonely I cry randomly, its pathetic. There is no reason why I should feel like this, I’ve had a very normal life without any trauma, this only makes me feel guilty for the way I am. Guilt I don’t deserve to feel when there’s so many more out there in far worse situations. [/INST]  Thanks so much for writing in and reaching out for help. I have seen many clients in my therapy office who express similar feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, focus on their own imperfections, and have extreme guilt for feeling so sad and lonely because they’ve had a “pretty normal life.” It sounds to me like you are suffering from severe depression and anxiety that are keeping you in a downward spiral, unable to reach out for help. The good news is you have reached out on this forum, so I am very hopeful that you can reach out in other areas.I urge you to talk to your parents and ask them for help. You said you haven’t talked to your parents because they will tell you to go to a doctor. If they love and care about you they will tell you to go to a doctor or a therapist because that’s the right thing to do when a family member is ill. I suggest that you keep an open mind about medication. While it doesn’t need to be the first course of treatment, it can definitely be a helpful tool in treatment. Ask your doctor for a psychotherapist referral as individual psychotherapy can be very effective. Often, a combination of medication and psychotherapy can be effective in treating depression and anxiety.In order to experience some change in your life and find happiness you will need to take some action, even if you don’t want to, and even if it’s a small one – like talking to your parents about how hopeless you feel. You can do it. It sounds to me like what you’re experiencing isn’t really “you” but is mental illness clouding your thoughts and feelings. You can have more satisfaction and joy in living than what you’re experiencing.Take good care of yourself!Julie Hanks, LCSW </s>"
"<s>[INST] I don’t know for a fact that my mom is cheating, but everything points to yes, what should I do? [/INST]  What a miserable spot for you to be in! It is terrible for you to know something isn’t right but to be stuck in how to move through it. There are lots of different ways to approach this, so keep in mind that my advice is just one avenue.I would talk to your mom and tell her what your thoughts and feelings are about how her behavior is affecting you. Don’t assume, accuse or blame, but rather give her feedback about how her behavior is affecting you. (“When I come over and you run off to the computer or leave the house on an errand it makes me feel upset because you seem so distant.”) Explain that it seems she is distracted and not focused on the family and that it gives you cause for concern. Let her know this isn’t something that has happened once or twice, but you have been feeling this way about her behavior for a while.This allows you to stay focused on what is real between the two of you without going down the path of accusation. If your mother is having an affair – which it sounds like she is, an emotional one at least — these tend to end badly for everyone. The chances are that your father has noticed the change in her behavior and they will have to deal with the eventual conflict. Stay focused on your relationship and how her behavior affects you. This will keep everything on the table as to the dynamics of her relationship with you. It gives you the chance to say something about your discomfort, and may give your mother a wakeup call that her (not-so-secretive) behavior is affecting others.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] My husband and I are presently living with my mother in her house for the last 10 yrs. I have a brother that moved in with us 2.5 yrs ago. Years ago he had some sort of breakdown and moved in with my parents and stayed for 4 yrs. I found some odd things on his computers. He was on some sort of online site with animals portrayed as humans. A curvy woman’s body with a sexy fox female face. I also found a small lion cub (Simba) stuffed animal with a small circular hole under the tail that was hot glued around the circle so that one could see the stuffing inside. I am guessing he was using it as a sex toy. I told my mother she asked me to call the psychiatrist he was seeing. I did he told me to get him out of the house immediately. I told my mother and she had him leave. He was laid off 2.5 yrs ago I found evidence of the same sort of behavior. This time it was a small black panther with the same odd hole under the tail and glued around, also his screensaver had a picture of a sexy woman with a fox face. I see little foxes scattered around the room he stays in. Guessing it’s his female animal of choice. I never said anything to my mother she’s been ill so I kept quiet. Lately he and I don’t get along. We (husband and I) don’t trust him. We lock our doors even if we are only outside feeding the dogs. He always lies and has already stole from us but denies it. My mother says she can’t survive without him. Rather than looking for he decided to stay here and care for our mother. She could do more for herself but he waits on her hand and foot. We got into an argument and I told her we were going to have to move I can’t stand living with him. She doesn’t want me to leave. I would like to confront him but not sure how far to push this. He’s very passive aggressive. I know I should leave but really can’t afford to and my mother wants us to stay. She may not live much longer anyway. How do I survive in the mean time? He’s creepy. [/INST]  This type of situation needs to be managed. As difficult as it is to make changes in your life and your mother’s life you;’ll need to face the situation now, directly. If the psychiatrist warned the family and told you to put him out, I’d honor that advice. I would encourage you and your husband to begin a detailed discussion with your mom about what is best for all of you. The goal is to keep the dialogue going with her so you can keep helping her understand your concerns. Also, I’d be certain that your mother’s affairs are in order. It sounds like you may not be able to trust your brother and will have to deal with him even after your mom is gone.Also, as a side note, research shows that successful aging comes for doing more things for yourself — not by being waited on hand and foot.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
"<s>[INST] I am 53 and one of 5 kids. Mother left Dad (us) in the ’80s for a woman in another State. She (they) eventually moved back but lived several hours away. We are only now realizing that many of our trials in life have been a result of her abandonment, lies, narcissism, and reluctance to acknowledge her hypochondria (which nearly frightened us to death as kids)or seek therapy for her own survivor’s guilt from when her own mother was killed by a drunk driver. [/INST]  Although you say you accepted the loss 35 years ago, you continue to feel guilt about the lack of connection and anticipate renewed grief when your mother actually dies. This suggests to me that you are suffering from what is called “incomplete mourning.” Because the loss was from abandonment, not death, it may be that you didn’t get the support you needed at the time. You couldn’t quite move on all the way because you didn’t have the finality of death. Instead you were left with some flicker of hope that you’d finally get the mother you longed for and deserved.You lost your mother in a very real way when you were only 18 and launching into adulthood. Research tends to overlook young adults who lose their moms, according to Taranjit (Tara) K. Bhatia, PsyD, a clinical psychologist who specializes in relationships, including mother-daughter bonds. Because they’re already adults, people assume these daughters don’t need maternal guidance. However, losing a mom has a powerful effect on young adult daughters. I imagine that you were angry, confused and sad. You might have even worried that you had done something wrong to cause it. You had a mother who was alive in the world who wasn’t really alive for you.Well-intended people are suggesting you call her, which seems to be triggering the incomplete mourning. Those people don’t know your history. They are basing their suggestion on an assumption of a healthier relationship than you have ever had. They don’t understand that sometimes personal emotional health depends on separating from a toxic parent.I see no reason for you to change your level of contact with her. Holiday visits and an occasional call acknowledge her, but maintain an appropriate boundary. There is no reason to think that increasing contact will get you the mother you always wanted. She isn’t likely to change at this point. You are likely to only re-experience the wounds of being left.Instead, focus on accepting the positive “mothering” that comes from your friends and others who love you. Positive adult friendships include the nurturing and loving elements of mothering without the craziness your bio mother offers.As for the people who are trying to give you advice: Thank them courteously for their concern and go your own way. They aren’t likely to understand your choice so there is no point in arguing with them. You don’t owe them an explanation. You certainly don’t need to follow their bad advice. Spend your time and energy with the people who count.If you continue to be distressed, I encourage you to see a counselor to help you finish grieving the biological mother and to find the mothering you need in others.I wish you well.  </s>"
"<s>[INST]  I am 19 years old and have a supportive family and live in a nice house, and I am currently in university however I hate my life. I hate everything about it. I hate myself, I have no friends, I don’t go out and I’ve never had a boyfriend in my life. I’m ugly and worthless. When I was in high school I was bullied because of the way I look, no one took me serious when I told them about it; they always said that it’s what kids do even teachers ignored me. A few years ago every day I contemplated life without me and thought about different ways of killing myself but I talked myself out of it. Every night I used to cry for hours in my room. I no longer do this but now I don’t feel anything at all, I find everything boring or dull and have no motivation. I just want to enjoy life like I used to without caring what others think. I don’t k now what to do anymore. [/INST]  It sounds as though you may have depression. Many of your symptoms are characteristic of that disorder, including: sadness, low self-esteem, lack of motivation, crying spells, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation. All of your symptoms point to that as a real possibility.You asked about what you should do. The answer is to seek treatment. Excellent and effective treatments exist for depression. Treatments include medication, talk therapy or a combination of both. You should consider entering treatment as soon as possible.Feelings of worthlessness are common among people with depression. Feeling that way can make it difficult to be hopeful or encouraged about treatment. “Why bother?” you may think. Your may erroneously believe that attempting treatment would be a waste of time, or that you are not worth helping. The challenge becomes getting treatment, despite your negative feelings.It is important to understand that depression clouds judgment. Abraham Maslow quotes the English psychoanalyst Money-Kyrle who believed that individuals with depression and related illnesses are “not emotionally sick” but “cognitively wrong.” In other words, individuals with depression are thinking incorrectly. They are not viewing reality clearly. Therapy could help to correct your thinking to make it more consistent with reality.I hope that you will consider seeking treatment. Many people who have struggled with depression have made full recoveries. Don’t hesitate to write again if you have additional questions. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] They’re around different times every year. It seems to be random, but every few months, a get delusional to the point of not leaving my house for about two weeks time. It goes away instantly, but not before wrecking my life/relationships/stability. I suffer from major depression and anxiety. I’ve been on all sorts of medications, but these delusional periods existed before any meds came into the picture. I also suffer from ptsd due to trauma as a kid. [/INST]  Without more information, it’s difficult for me to determine what might be wrong. If I could interview you in person, I would want more details about your delusions. It’s possible that they are not delusions, but more information would be necessary to make that determination.Understandably, you’re concerned about having to go to the hospital but you’re making a mistake by withholding this information from your therapist. If your therapist was aware of your symptoms, he or she would probably refer you to a psychiatrist for a medication evaluation. Delusions can be effectively treated with medication.You believe that your delusions are random but have you tracked them? Perhaps they occur more frequently around the anniversary of a traumatic incident or when you have not slept, or so on. Try documenting your experiences. Maybe they are not so random after all.You said that your delusions come and go. In that case, why not talk to your therapist about them when you’re not actively experiencing them and thus not a danger to yourself? Under those circumstances, you would not have to worry about hospitalization. That might be an ideal time to reveal this information to your therapist.Your therapist is in the best position to help you but only if you’re willing to be completely honest about your concerns. Always, always reveal everything to your therapist. I hope that you will consider my advice. Please take care. </s>"
"<s>[INST] I have been wanting to see a therapist about self-harm and depression but I don’t want my parents to ever be aware of either. I have seen a therapist in the past for social anxiety and I was highly considering asking my parents to take me to another therapist for social anxiety but in all reality it would be more for the depression. Can I do this without them knowing about the depression and self harm (I’m not currently self harming)? Is the therapist required to tell them that I am depressed and such, because my parents have no knowledge of it? I want to be 100% sure of what they’d have to tell my parents before I do this. I don’t want my parents to know because it could be potentially stressful or painful for them and I have worked very hard on keeping it a secret for this long and I hope they will never know of mainly the self harm. I’m 17. Thank you for your time. [/INST] A: Let me begin by saying that I think you are putting way too much energy into keeping these issues from your parents; energy that you could be putting into getting better. What would be so bad about your parents knowing that you have struggled with depression?  I can understand that you don’t want them to know about the self-harm, but chances are that it is related to the depression, too.Each therapist may handle the lines of disclosure between a parent and teen differently. Although, in most states, there are some basic laws and guidelines that must be followed, such as disclosing if someone is at risk of harming themselves or others. But again, the definition of self-harm typically means suicide, not self-harm such as minor cutting.I suggest that you ask your parents to take you back to the therapist you saw before or a new therapist, if you prefer. Use any reason you are comfortable with to get there, but once in therapy, ask the therapist about their policies of disclosing information to parents. You are 17 (almost an adult) so most therapists would be willing to work with you on some things without full parental knowledge as long as you are truly not in danger. The therapist can help you decide what is important enough to tell your parents. However, there may be reasons beyond your control that would lead to disclosing more to them, such as needing a medication evaluation.Your parents love you and want what is best for you. You don’t have to suffer in silence. They may handle all this much better than you realize, but you won’t know if you don’t give them that chance.  All the best, </s>"
"<s>[INST] Ever since I was a kid I have been struggling through friendships connecting to people and doing things on my own because my parents have always been strict with me . They never let me go out or anything or make friends and I reached the point where I was afraid to ask them do anything without their supervision. Today , I am a college student who struggles to make friends, has difficulty with social cues , and has a low level on knowledge in pop culture , often making it difficult for me to make relationships with anyone because I was never exposed to these things as a child. Additionally I have difficulties accepting my adult responsibilities and although my parents now pressure me to, I continue to procrastinate and refuse to take on my adult responsibilities on things that everyone else in my age group since to be taking care of. This includes things like getting a license, getting a job, making friends, or things as mundane as simply doing exercise so I could feel better about myself. A strong feeling of laziness has taken over me and whenever someone tells me I should do these things I become defensive and genuinely irritated and sometimes angry. This has turned into a destructive behavior I seem to have adapted to, and have lost many opportunities and even a relationship because of this behavior and the stress that accompanies it. Im 19 and still afraid of asking my parents if I can go out with friends. I want to change and I recognize that what I am doing isn’t healthy or helpful at all so what can I do to surpass my laziness,  my fear of doing out and things normally and assert independence from my parents ? How can I begin to move on into adulthood ? How can I work on changing this negative behavior myself ? [/INST]  Working on things by yourself is only going to help up to a point. In fact, believing you can handle this on your own is one of the issues — not where the solution lies. Since your concern is with other people and taking responsibilities the resolution is taking responsibility with others. I recommend going to your university counseling center to ask them if they have group therapy. If not, ask them for help in placing you in a group. You won’t be able to avoid the issue within the structure of group therapy. You will be encouraged and supported to find new ways to connect to others, while at the same time get straight feedback about your own behavior. It is a very direct form of dealing with your issues head-on.Wishing you patience and peace,  </s>"
