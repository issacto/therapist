About 8mths ago, my husband woke one day and said he was hearing voice, he complained of headaches; he wasn’t sleeping and became very religious. He said my family had tried to poison him or something spiritual- he also was paranoid. He was very cold, almost like a different person. He was loosing weight- just said things that didn’t make sense. I believe he had a psychotic episode either suffering from psychosis or depression- he may even be bipolar. About a month after, I came home and some of his things were gone. And was the last time I seen him. He is ok now, living on his own and sounds very functional, except that he calls with private #s, and still talks about my family poisoning him which is not the case. He’s a very intelligent man and so stubborn. I know he would have to be Denzel Washington to pull off what happen to him, so I don’t believe he was faking. I’ve seem him in the club drinking and dancing as if nothing happened. He didn’t seek medical attention (counseling or medication)…is it possible to recover the way he is now, functional without medication or at any given time it could happen again?<|im_end|>

 It may be possible to recover from psychosis without treatment but that is the exception rather than the norm. Generally, untreated psychosis becomes worse over time. Individuals typically continue to experience symptoms until the psychosis is treated. He may seem “okay” right now but you may not be seeing the full picture. His unwillingness to seek treatment is concerning as is his drinking. Alcohol and other drug use can exacerbate psychosis.Based on information that you have provided, I do not think he is well. He needs treatment. Psychosis does not generally improve on its own. In virtually all cases, treatment is necessary. Without such treatment, decompensation occurs.This is a very challenging situation. He is an adult and as such it is difficult to force him into treatment, especially if he does not want it or does not think that it is needed. Unfortunately, in many states, the only time that you can force someone into treatment is when they are on the verge of seriously harming themselves or someone else.My recommendation is to try to convince him to seek treatment. I understand that he may not be willing but it is worth a try. I would also recommend attempting to connect with other friends or family members who are concerned about his condition. He may be willing to attend treatment if several individuals share the opinion that he is not well.Two websites may be of assistance to you: the Treatment Advocacy Center and the National Alliance On Mental Illness(NAMI). The Treatment Advocacy Center provides information about state civil commitment laws. Their website also provides information about how to handle psychiatric emergencies and when to call for help. NAMI may be a helpful resource because they provide educational information about mental health disorders as well as guidance about navigating the mental health system. NAMI has support groups for family members who have a loved one with a mental illness. Most communities throughout the United States have such support groups. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I’m having existential issues. I have very good affect regulation and impulse control. I am on medication and have been in about 2 years of psychotherapy. I’ve struggled with suicidal ideation, not as a function of seeking attention or because I don’t feel loved or valued (I very much am) – I am also accomplished and motivated and have a life full of things to do – I’m physically healthy. My primary psychological issues are PTSD from extreme childhood abuse and neglect and I have almost no ability to attach to people. I’ve found suicide to be a rational expression of what I feel is a pointless life that I don’t care for anymore. I need to talk to someone about this in a philosophical sense and my therapist is on the side of life and it is dangerous to her professionally to help me with this issue. I also cannot get the personal (though still detached) reflections due to boundary issues. I really REALLY want to explore what I feel about death the way I may explore the issue of abortion (I’m pro-choice but anti-abortion for myself). With suicide I feel I am pro-choice there too but I’m wondering if it’s the right option for me. I need someone to consult with who isn’t professionally obligated to “save me” and can be impartial? Like a spiritual advisor? Or are there therapists you can sign a pre-release to make sure they do not get bothered for malpractice if I choose to die?<|im_end|>

 You are essentially asking for assisted suicide. Assisted suicide is almost universally illegal. I am aware of no cases in which a mental health professional has or would knowingly agree to assist a client in ending their life.In virtually all cases of assisted suicide, the individual who is considering suicide is experiencing agonizing physical circumstances. Their distress and pain are typically the result of an incurable medical illness, the prolonging of which could be characterized by some as tortuous or inhumane.With regard to psychological problems, under no circumstance is suicide an appropriate choice or action. Research supports this assertion. Case after case, study after study, has shown that suicide ideation is temporary and fleeting. The feelings eventually dissipate. Studies of individuals who have survived their suicide attempts report that survivors strongly regret their actions and were grateful to have lived. Many of those individuals feel so strongly about their mistakes that they have dedicated their lives to suicide prevention.You stated that you are loved but that you believe you’re not. That is evidence of an inability to see reality as it is. Nothing is more important than one’s ability to see reality clearly. Simply believing in the truth could prevent you making the biggest mistake of your life.The inability to see reality clearly might also be a sign of depression. Individuals who are depressed are more likely to consider suicide than individuals who are not depressed. Those around you do love you but you do not believe them. It could be that you do not feel worthy of their love so you deny that it exists. Feeling unworthy of love is a signature characteristic of depression.I would highly recommend that you strongly reconsider your plans. Take suicide “off the table.” Do not allow it to be an option. Realize that psychological pain can be eliminated from your life. It is often a matter of finding the right therapist or the right medication, or a combination of both. Explore your existential questions through meeting with a variety of mental health professionals. Become familiar with the work of Abraham Maslow, Viktor Frankl, and M. Scott Peck, all of whom wrote extensively about existential and psychological problems.Finally, consider how suicide would forever alter the lives of those who love you. You may not believe that they love you but the reality is, as you have stated, they do. That is reality. In all probability, your loss would be devastating and their suffering would be immense.I sincerely hope that you get the help that you desire. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Hello, my brother is 24 and was diagnosed with borderline syndrome a year ago. However, it was managed only with medication because he refused psychotherapy. For the past 1.5 months, after my mother refused to give him money, he said that he would stop going out. And for the past 1.5 months he didn,’t go outside. Lately, he was a bit more anxious and he did drink alcohol again (not too much) and started smoking again. Nothing was too alarming until 3 days ago he received some messages, went outside for 1h and when he came back, he started talking to people that weren’t there, yelling, than talking quietly, and it was like he was hallucinating. At one point he even changed his personality. At hospital they said that it was brief reactive psychosis (f23. 9) and gave him clozapine and risperidon, and some other medication that i don’t know. Since then, he did sleep, but he still talks, quietly, but still does.What do you think how long is this going to last? When will he stop talking? And does these hallucinations indicate that he has schizophrenia? I am very worried, so please answer me. Thank you.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
It’s impossible to diagnose over the internet. I would recommend asking these questions to his treating professionals. They would be in the best position to answer them since I can only provide a general response.You mentioned that he was diagnosed with brief reactive psychosis. The name is just as it sounds, he apparently had a short-lived psychotic episode. Some people have one psychotic episode and never have another. Others, continue to have additional psychotic episodes which may be indicative of a more severe disorder such as schizophrenia.It’s important to determine what caused his psychotic episode. You mentioned that he used alcohol which could have contributed to the problem. If he uses alcohol, he may also be using drugs. Drug use has been linked to psychosis.A schizophrenia diagnosis requires a certain number of illness symptoms to be present for a certain period of time. Delusions and hallucinations are indicative of schizophrenia but are also associated with brief psychotic disorders. Only time will tell what disorder he may or may not have. Encourage him to take his medication. Medication adherence and avoiding illicit substances will reduce the likelihood of having another psychotic episode.Do your best to encourage him to follow the orders of his treating professionals. That is the best way to prevent future psychotic episodes. If you have additional questions, please don’t hesitate to write again. I hope this helps. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Lately I have been having some really weird and crazy thoughts and questioning reality.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 The nature of your current thinking is worrisome. Your thinking may indicate a break with reality, also known as a psychosis. Psychosis occurs when someone has difficulty distinguishing what is real from what is not real.You described several delusional beliefs including strangers laughing at you, that you are living in “The Matrix” or “The Truman Show,” and believing that you are God. Delusions are a sign of psychosis.You also described having a frightening experience while being high. That experience led you to question reality and whether or not anything is real. That particular type of delusion is called a nihilistic delusion. It involves the belief that nothing is real.Diagnosis over the Internet is impossible which is why it is important for you to undergo an evaluation by a mental health professional. You should also stop using drugs. I receive many letters from individuals who seem to experience psychosis-like symptoms after using drugs. We don’t know if drug use causes mental illness but it does exacerbate symptoms of mental illness. It would be dangerous for you to continue to use drugs.You should not ignore your symptoms. Research consistently shows that untreated psychosis is associated with a poor prognosis. It is extremely important to intervene sooner rather than later. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I don’t know where to begin. It seems stupid just to come here and write about what’s wrong with me. Or what I think is wrong with me. All my problems seem made up by myself. I ocassionally feel depressed, but I don’t deserve to be depressed. I have everything in my life to be happy: family, some friends, upper middle class upbringing, material things. I feel guilty and ungrateful.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You have expressed three main cognitive errors that may be contributing to your distress. I will describe them below.The first cognitive error is that you should not be depressed because you have material wealth. The implication is that wealth should make you happy. Of course you should appreciate your good fortune and your blessings but wealth does not equal happiness. Study after study shows that to be true.There is no roadmap in life; for any of us. Many people feel lost. Each of us, rich or poor, has to find our own path. It’s easy to get off track and to become depressed, especially when lacking guidance and a strong mentor. Counseling could provide you with the necessary guidance and mentorship.Depression is often the result of a lack of purpose in one’s life. In order to be happy we have to find meaning in life. That’s an overly simplistic view of depression but without that key element, many people, no matter their socioeconomic status, feel empty, sad and alone. The good news is that depression is a highly treatable condition.The second cognitive error expressed in your question, is that everyone is in a relationship except for you. I believe that what you meant is that everyone else is happy except for you. That is a fallacy. People who are depressed often think that everyone is better off than they are. They are intimately familiar with their own pain and suffering but they do not perceive the pain and suffering of others. That’s largely because people don’t generally express their negative emotions in public or even to close friends. They think it will make them seem less likeable, less cool, and more needy. They suffer alone, in isolation, where there are no witnesses. Even though you can’t feel it or see it, many people are suffering. Life is challenging for most everyone.The third cognitive error is that you should be able to solve your own problems. You didn’t say that directly but you implied it when you wrote that you have tried to help yourself and it has not worked. The disappointment has led you to feel like you have failed. That is common thinking about mental health.People don’t believe that they should be able to treat their own physical health problems yet it’s common for them to think that they should be able to treat their own mental health problems. Mental health professionals undergo years of rigorous training to learn how to treat mental health problems. These are learned skills. You shouldn’t expect to be able to solve your own problems. No one should.When you know that something is wrong, you should ask for help. You could greatly benefit from counseling. Counseling is an effective treatment for depression and many other emotional problems. Medication might also be helpful. I urge you to ask your parents to assist you in seeking treatment. That would be the right thing to do. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Met a girl in church, about 1.5 years ago. Relationship mostly good, but – 4 times now – when she doesn’t have her kids for the weekend, and I want to have an alone night, she gets really angry and demanding. She takes her house key back, “breaks up”, then calls me two hours later crying wanting to know “why do you date me?…”. Very dramatic.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Thanks for sending in your question. It actually sounds like you have a pretty good sense of what to do. You’ve only been dating a short time and as the relationship is going on you’ve seen and experienced more things that aren’t okay with you. She’s asking you to do something you don’t want to do, and don’t believe in. Don’t assume this is going to get better. She’s telling you very clearly where she is –and what she wants. You seemed equally clear in saying you don’t agree with her.So for right now –keep dating. There is no pressure for anyone to get married and there’s a lot more to learn. There are some clear differences that would have to be worked out if you did decide to get together.Take your time this is a financial, emotional, and complex situation. No need to rush.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Hello, to start off i want to ask why i have the urge to kill someone, i keep getting ideas and plans to kill someone i dont like. It occurs at random moments but more often when im pissed. I make real plans for it, things like injecting them with poison or making it look like an accident. And there is also another thing, i am really distant from other people and dont really have a social life anymore, i like it but am also unhappy about it at the same time. As that builded up i also started to have more strange things like talking to myself and talking very much like a toddler, people rarely understand me if i dont try hard enough. I also have somewhat my own religion, and i am the god. When i am falling asleep i always feel that i must lay down very normally within ten seconds because else some evil ghost sees it, but after that my guard ghost sets up a force field, so i dont have to care anymore. I also had some really strange hallucinations when i was younger, like seeing beheaded bodys with their heads next to them staring at me in the middle of the night, waking me up instantly. And also a sort of eaten apple thats tinted red with a birds mouth making a scary noise and chasing me. And theres more of those things. I dont thinks this is normal so please help.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You are concerned about the normality of your experiences and I share your concerns. It’s not normal to have the urge to kill. It may indicate that you are feeling out of control, not thinking clearly and you may be a danger to others.Your symptoms also seem to suggest that you have difficulty distinguishing reality from non-reality. The urge to kill, isolation and losing touch with reality are concerning symptoms.I would strongly urge you to have a psychiatric evaluation. The purpose of an evaluation is to determine if a mental health condition is present and if so, to identify the most appropriate intervention. Ask your primary care physician for a referral for a psychiatric evaluation. Make sure to involve your parents in this matter.You should also go to the hospital if you feel out of control or believe that you may harm someone else or feel that you are losing touch with reality.Intervention is important in cases where an individual feels that he or she might be dangerous or is losing touch with reality. With the right treatment, your symptoms can be controlled or eliminated, allowing you to return to a healthy state of mind. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I have 6 kids. Three are from my previous marriage and three are from my husbands first marriage, he was widowed when the kids were 2,2,5. All of my kids have suffered loss. I have adopted the kids and we are raising them very intentionally as one family. I love them all and that is our commitment to them. It has not been easy handling a family of this size. My husband and I work very hard to do it well but we are doing it and everyone is doing well. The problem I have is with my Mother in law. She treats her non biological grandchild ( she actually does not consider them grandchildren at all) distinctly differently. (examples: from not displaying pictures of them, unequal gifts, unfair discipline, general lack of interest to outright directly unkind treatment). I have noticed this for years and hoped it fade. The kids are all very good and loving children and love each other as full siblings for which I am very proud.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Your mother-in-law is missing the chance to be in a loving relationship with three more children. What a loss for her! My guess is that she isn’t going to listen to you. But she may listen to her son. He has embraced all of these kids as his own (as have you). He needs to protect them all as well. That means having a difficult conversation with his mother about treating all of his kids as her grandchildren, regardless of bloodlines. None of his kids is “just” anything. To love him as her son means to respect his choice, to love the children he loves, and to respect you as his wife. I hope your husband can enlist his father’s support as well.If she won’t or can’t change, it’s important that you and your husband to talk with the children. Kids, even middle school kids, usually accept the judgments of older people in their family. Make sure they understand there isn’t anything wrong with them and that it is grandma’s loss that she can’t see them for the wonderful children they are. Make sure they understand that in your eyes how people come into the family doesn’t matter. Family is a way of feeling, not a function of genetics.Unless and until she changes her attitude and behavior, I don’t think it wise to leave the kids in her care. The kids certainly see the unequal treatment. It’s to their credit that they stood up for one another. But they are too young to be expected to just let her unequal treatment roll off them. It’s enough that they learn to be polite around her. It’s potentially damaging to their self-esteem and their relationships with each other to ask them to accept her as an authority figure in their lives.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My sister was diagnosed schizophrenic recently. After researching it and dealing with her, I am worried I have it. I have believed for a long time that I can know peoples thoughts, feelings, and problems. I believe they can know mine. I get scared to think about things without having tons of blankets on, because it protects me from them knowing what I think about or feel. when i think under blankets i can meet people in my mind through our spirits. My body feels really cold even though I have on tons of blankets. I have problems talking to people in person. i get confused and cant concentrate. I do okay writing to people. When I am talking face to face I have a voice inside screaming obcenities at me. I avoid people. I have not had a job for 10 years and when I have in the past I never had one for over 6 months. I am not lazy but I am so nervous I cant go. Luckily my husband is understanding. I have sexual abuse and rape in my past. I have hiegene problems. I am afraid to wear different clothes. I always wear the same ones for years at a time. i am afraid to drive. I am depressed most of the time. I wouldn’t kill myself but sometimes I feel like I really should to give my family a better life. I am fat. My sister doesnt eat but I over eat. I never realized these things could indicate mental illness until studying about my sisters illness. do i have it, too? what should i do? I have no insurance or money. i would love to have a more functional life for my kids and husband.<|im_end|>

 It seems as though you may have some of the symptoms of schizophrenia but without knowing the severity or frequency of your symptoms, I cannot know with certainty.For instance, you stated that you are frightened to think about things without covering yourself with blankets. How often does this occur? Five times a day, once a week, once a month?When speaking to people in person, in what ways are you confused? Do you not understand what they are saying? Is anxiousness or nervousness part of the problem?The voices screaming obscenities at you, how often does this occur? Every time you speak to someone? Does this happen with family members or just strangers?As you can see, there are many questions for which I do not have answers. It is unusual and a potential sign of psychosis for an individual to hear voices, especially those that are screaming obscenities.Individuals with schizophrenia often have problems with hygiene. Your problems with hygiene stem from your fear of wearing different clothes but it’s unclear why this fear exists.It’s unclear whether the issues you’re struggling with are due to anxiety, schizophrenia or any specific mental health disorder. What I find particularly encouraging about your situation is the level of insight that you have about your symptoms. Individuals with schizophrenia often do not have this level of awareness.The best way to determine if you have schizophrenia or any mental health disorder would be to have an evaluation by a mental health professional. The local community mental health center (CMHC) may be able to provide you with a free psychological evaluation. Most communities have CMHCs that offer free or low-cost services to individuals struggling with finances.The staff at the CMHC can assist you in accessing treatment which would likely include medication. Medication could greatly assist with your symptoms and allow you to live a more functional life. Medication often cannot extinguish all symptoms but many medications dramatically reduce symptoms and greatly improve the quality of an individual’s life. I wish you the best luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Hello, thank you for reading this, People say overthinking is to think about a given issue way too much for me let’s say I had some trouble a week ago and now I have made a decision and that problem Is all solved and I know it however when I am free or happy I force myself to think about it and everything I just can’t stop it and I do that until I stop feeling happy. I do believe I have OCD however could this be a symptom of it? Also when I am very frustrated I cut it doesn’t give me happiness and isn’t an addiction it’s very rare but when I do cut I feel calm again and my mind goes to rest usually people cut to feel something and after that they feel happy which is not my case so is my cutting still an issue? I hope to hear back from you. Thank You so much for your time and efforts I appreciate it.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
It doesn’t matter why you cut yourself, it only matters that you do. Self-harm is always concerning. It should never be considered as a viable solution to any problem. It’s a sign of unhappiness and a lack of healthy coping skills. If you knew a better way to feel better, you would utilize it. People utilize unhealthy coping skills when they don’t know what else to do.Regarding your thinking, it could be a sign of an anxiety disorder. You have difficulty preventing rumination. That’s often a sign of anxiety or a related disorder such as depression. People who are depressed also engage in cutting. Sometimes depressed people will cut themselves because they feel like they don’t deserve anything better. In other words, they punish themselves.These issues could be resolved with counseling. I would strongly advise you to contact a local therapist and ask for help. These are very common problems and they will know how to help you.In the meantime, you might try meditation or other mindfulness techniques. The idea behind these techniques is relaxing and quieting your mind. Some people find that listening to music or watching ASMR videos on YouTube are good ways to relax. There are many other examples. It may take some time to find something that relaxes you but it’s worth the effort to find something that helps. Good luck with your efforts. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My boyfriend immigrated here when he was 5. His family is very involved in their native culture/church and he is not. Due to them previously needing financial help and therefore him being in debt, he is unable to move out for another 1-2 years. They strongly prefer he be with someone from their culture and would constantly pressure him about it. Throughout our relationship they would tell him he should leave and try to set him up with other people (sometimes while I was standing there in their native language).<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I admire your persistence and grit for each other in this relationship. But not much will move you forward as a couple until he moves out. At your ages it is time to carve out the kind of life you are looking to live independent of his family. They sound abusive, demeaning, and unsupportive. The question for you is whether or not this relationship works for you. If you move in together it is likely they family will not accept you as you move forward.The work for your boyfriend is to make the break independently from his relationship to you. He would need to leave because of issues with the family — not only because he loves you. This is difficult but likely to be a needed step. If he leaves only for you they will blame the relationship (and you). If he leaves because they are not honoring him it will be understood differently. It is an act of independence rather than because of his feelings for you.I highly recommend you find counseling through your university for yourself as you work things through with him. If it is possible for the two of you to see a counselor together this will be important. It will help clarify what needs to be done as a couple, and what needs to be done independently.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From a 17 year old young woman in the U.S.: My sister tells on me about everything like we’re 5. She tells my dad if I go outside, if I talk to boys, If I use my laptop or phone, or if I go outside. What is wrong with her? Why does she do that?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I don’t know what’s wrong with your sister. I do know that her behavior is unacceptable. Where are your parents? How is it that she is allowed to hurt you? If she is living in the home, your parents have the right and obligation to tell her that she can’t behave like this. You (and her son) deserve their protection.My only guess about the way she treats you is the same as yours — jealousy. It may be very painful to watch you have a life that is so different from her own. She had a baby when she was only 16. She may regret her choices. She may feel that she missed out on the fun of being a teen.Go to college to get an education, not to get appreciation from your sister. Whatever her issues are, it’s unlikely that seeing you move forward in life is going to cause her to think differently.Meanwhile, I hope your sister is getting some therapy and some parent education. She is only 20. She has a long life ahead of her. She will do herself and her son a big favor if she takes care of her issues now so they both can be happy and healthy.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 You asked if anxiety could be the cause of your medical problems. The answer is yes. Untreated anxiety can negatively impact physical health. Panic disorder, a type of anxiety disorder, involves having severe anxiety attacks. Panic attacks are intense episodes of anxiety and fear. During these attacks, people can experience shortness of breath, heart palpitations and chest pains. Severe cases of anxiety can be mentally and physically debilitating.While anxiety disorders can lead to physical health problems, it’s always wise to rule out medical problems before confirming a mental health disorder. If your doctors have ruled out medical problems, it increases the likelihood that you may have an anxiety disorder.I would strongly urge you to seek mental health treatment as soon as possible. There are many effective treatments for anxiety and panic. The most comprehensive treatments include both therapy and medication.In severe cases of anxiety, a doctor may prescribe a quick-acting medication called a benzodiazepine. Eventually, antidepressants and beta blockers may be added to assist with long-term symptom management.My recommendation is to consult a mental health professional who can evaluate your symptoms and determine the proper course of treatment for your possible anxiety disorder. The vast majority of people who seek treatment for an anxiety disorder have success. I hope you will consider this recommendation. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I think I’ve been depressed a long time, and providing self-therapy without knowing it, and it’s not enough. I’ve been told that depression runs in my family, though my mother’s never specifically told me who has it (and my extended family isn’t close enough for me to figure that out myself) and I’m afraid I may be too. It started early in high school. Hanging out with other people wasn’t appealing, I didn’t want to join any clubs, at lunch I sat with people I knew marginally just so as not to sit alone. Mind you, plenty of people tried to be my friend and I just wasn’t open to it. I was very self-conscious about my looks until about last year, when I got my first boyfriend, and now it just marginally haunts me; however, I know, if we broke up, I would still have that confidence regardless. People in my family are very smart and successful (doctors, scientists, lawyers…) and though I have my own talents I can’t seem to show them. Working at all feels so difficult. I used to be active and now it mentally hurts and is so strenuous to exercise. Occasionally I’ll feel normal and it feels so amazing to not hurt at all. Sometimes I’ll go beyond that and just do, do, do- clean everything, write essays, write short stories- but that only happens up to 3 times a year max. Much more often I sink into awful depression where I cry for hours without reason (about once or twice every 2 months, more in the winter and summer).<|im_end|>

 I would concur with your assessment that your attempts to help yourself “[aren’t] cutting it.” The proof is that your depression symptoms remain present. I admire your continued efforts to help yourself but it is important to recognize when those attempts are not working and to be willing to seek help from a professional. The latter should be your next step.It’s not clear from your letter why you are reluctant to seek help. You might fundamentally believe that asking for help is a sign of weakness or that you “should” be able to solve your own problems. That type of mindset can be self-destructive in that it often leads to prolonged suffering. It is also an inefficient approach to problem-solving.In the American culture, many people find it perfectly acceptable to seek medical attention when they are experiencing physical health symptoms. That same logic should be applied in cases of mental health symptoms.It is obvious that you are suffering. You can begin to end your suffering by seeing a mental health professional. Virtually all college campuses have mental health professionals on staff to help their students. I would advise that you make an appointment as soon as possible with a mental health professional. Seeking professional help would be the most efficient and responsible way to handle your situation. I hope that you agree with my assessment and are able to receive the help that you deserve. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Need help dealing with high conflict ex-wife of boyfriend. They share custody of 3 teens; divorced 7 years. He let her stay in his house while between apartments after getting evicted, but then stayed 8 months longer while all the kids lived there and she continued to collect child support and stay overnight with her new bf. She has bad credit and dogs so this was her excuse for not being able to find a home. When he insisted that she leave she got angry and left her dogs behind. This is the second set of dogs she has abandoned and one set has lived with my bf for 7 years now. He refuses to keep another two dogs and has told her she must take them. Her solution was to take them to the shelter with his 14 year old son, telling him his father was forcing her to do it, that his father is selfish for not letting her leave the dogs “for just another few weeks.” My bf’s son, who is a “young” 14, is sad and angry at his father, which is typical of these scenarios. This isn’t, as you might imagine, just about the dogs – boundaries that are enforced are punished through the kids. I encourage him to keep strong boundaries and he does increasingly so. In the big picture, I think it is the right thing to do for him and his children, but the stress of these constant “punishments” is making him physically sick. He spent years bending over backwards so as to keep some kind of relationship with his children, but they are older now (and he is late 50s and exhausted) and is really trying to change the dynamic. Yesterday, she stole his EZ pass out of his car and had her oldest daughter text him that they needed to go on a college visit (note that she already receives 40k a year post tax for the kids, works part time, so desperate for $ is kooky). I would call the police for even small infractions to make a point, but my bf knows only his kids will suffer and he just can’t stand to watch. The kids cling to “mommy” and crave her affection — the more inconsistent she is the more they cling. Sad. Any advice? Help.<|im_end|>

Okay. This all started from when I was eight years old. My mom and step dad both worked a lot so they would have my cousin Amber babysit me. One day she kept me inside the house and pulled all of the blinds shut. She proceeded to force me to perform oral sexual favors on her. She was 16 at the time I believe. So, after forcing me to do this she took me to the bedroom and forced me to have sex with her. After she was done she made me clean everything up saying if I got caught she would kill me. A little time passed from there and she took me outside to go play with the neighbor kids. We all ended up taking a walk back through the woods until we came across the interstate. Amber and the older kids started playing chicken with the cars and then they thought it would be a good idea to force me into playing. They put what looked like a screen material over my head and shoved me out in front of a big rig. Luckily I fell short of the truck. I am now 22 and over the past few months I have several nightmares a week reliving the event. Also, when I was 10 I watched my great great grandmother pass away in front of me. Now I see her from time to time out of the corner of my eye. Could this be PTSD? Also I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I feel the need to self harm a lot but can refrain from it most of the time. I’ve been clean two weeks now but the urges keep getting stronger. I did just get back on my insurance policy and am currently considering a therapist again and getting back on my celexa. I was initially out on it after a suicide attempt 3 years ago. Please help me figure out what direction I should head in.<|im_end|>

 Be proud of the fact that you have been able to withstand the urge to self-harm but as you noted, the urges are growing stronger. Don’t ignore those feelings. They are a clear sign that you should seek professional help. It would be a very wise decision.It’s possible that the experience of seeing your dead grandmother is a sign of PTSD. It might be a flashback but without more information, I can’t know that with certainty. Reliving the truck incident is likely a flashback and related to PTSD.You can learn more about flashbacks and PTSD once you begin counseling. You can also educate yourself about PTSD. You can read more about it at Psych Central’s website as well as other websites including the National Institute of Mental Health, among others.You are a victim of abuse. It can directly affect your self-confidence and self-esteem. Your babysitter was a predator. Had anyone learned about what she did to you, she would have likely been arrested. At the very least, she may have been mandated to undergo counseling.You are considering therapy and my recommendation is that you do so. Fortunately, you have health insurance, which affords you the opportunity to seek treatment. You are on the right track. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I would like to be able to talk to someone but know the only way I’ll be able to talk about personal issues is to pay a therapist. The problem is that owning to a number of previous experiences, I can’t find one that seems to work for me. I have post traumatic stress disorder. I have been receiving an increasing number of death threats as the country becomes more polarized. My most recent death threat came just last month. In December I was held at gun point and in May of 2014 someone actually took a shot at me. Because of the nature of my work law enforcement cannot be involved as that is a violation of the offender’s privacy. Everything is reported through work, but I’m having trouble coping because most people in the area, including my family, thinks that shooting at Federal Employees makes for good sport. (These are people who deify Cliven Bundy and probably Ted Bundy.) I was seeing a professor through the University of Idaho, but stopped seeing him in private practice after he killed his girlfriend in 2011. He’s in prison now. In 2013 I was seeing a different therapist, but he told me that I was under satanic attack and the President Obama was brainwashing me. I stopped seeing him immediately because I was pretty sure he was crazier than I was. Most recently I was seeing a man from January to April who insisted that my life would be better if I converted to Christianity and started attending church. He wasn’t as crazy as the previous guy, but I do wish I could talk to a therapist who isn’t trying to change my religion (I’m not christian), sexuality (I don’t know if I’m hetero, homo, or bi and I don’t see how it’s relevant since I haven’t been on a date since 2006), career path (I work for the Federal Government), or relationship status (single and staying that way). What are some key questions to ask a person before starting therapy and ultimately wasting my time and money? Also, what kinds of answers do I need to be looking for from the therapist?

 Wow, you have had some incredible bad luck with therapists. I’m so sorry and hope that your next experience will be much more helpful. The best ways to find a therapist are to get a referral from someone you trust, such as a like-minded friend who has been to the person themselves, or to read up on the therapist before you ever make an appointment. Many therapists have personal websites these days or have profiles on public sites like Psych Central or Psychology Today. This way you can see what they are all about and narrow down the field of candidates.The next step is to request a consultation, either by phone or in person, if available.  This gives you a chance to see if you think it will be a good match. I would recommend that you ask how much experience the person has treating PTSD, especially in relation to complications with government employers. For example, a therapist who has worked with police and fire or military clients might be well versed in the issues you face. Based on your past experience, I would also recommend that you specifically seek a therapist who does not describe themselves as a Christian counselor.My last thought on the matter would be to speak to your human resource department regarding EAP services or to see if they have contracts with therapists to help employees such as yourself. This may be the easiest and most affordable way to get help. I hope that you stay safe and find a good match with a therapist soon.All the best,<|im_end|>"

 You are in a difficult predicament. The person who you are trying to help is refusing all of your efforts. That further complicates the situation.I believe your concerns are valid. Your friend may be experiencing psychosis. Most people with psychosis are not violent but they can be, under certain circumstances, such as in the scenario you have described. Though it is unlikely, that scenario is not outside the realm of possibility.There’s also the issue of possible suicide. He stated that he knows that he will not be living by the age of 19. That statement might be indicative of a delusion but it could also mean that he is planning to end his life.Psychosis jumbles the mind. It is a struggle to know what is real and what is not real. Psychosis can be very frightening but it is treatable with medication.My recommendation is to contact the local mental health crisis team and ask for their assistance. They can come to his home and evaluate his condition and determine if hospitalization is necessary. You can identify if mental health crises services are available in his community by doing a Google search or by contacting the local hospital or health department.In Florida, an individual is eligible for inpatient hospitalization (even in the absence of health insurance) when they meet at least one of the following criteria:<|im_end|>"

I have problems organizing my thoughts or connecting them. My long term and short term memory are always fuzzy. Trouble focusing. Sporadic sleeping patterns. I’m 20 now, but since about 7th grade I’ve had strange feelings and emotions. I could never focus in school. It was like I thought about everything and nothing all at once and it just became a huge gnarled mass of abstract thoughts with little foundation. I’ve had some darkness in my life since I can remember. I look at photos from long ago of myself and my family and I can barely connect. In middle school the only people I looked up to were the Columbine school shooters and demonic idols. I wanted to commit mass murder. I fantasized about it. I have discovered myself in the past 3 years to be a nihilist and somewhat of a misanthrope. I can’t be happy. When I am it’s for a few minutes to an hour or two. Then I get really self critical and start questioning everything in existence. I have no friends around. I’ve never had a relationship with anyone from the opposite sex. I find it hard to get aroused watching sexually explicit material sometimes. I usually end up questioning the workings of society and humanity at some point during the viewing of sexually explicit material. My only joy in this world is masturbation, nicotine consumption, and recording music. I don’t really enjoy those things anymore. I haven’t for a while, but I keep doing them. I write poetry about humanity and narrow minded ideology. It’s painful but I end up laughing at its frankness. I can’t keep a job. I make detrimental split second decisions on occasion. I hate socializing most of the time. I rarely move. I forget I even exist a lot of the time. I hate life. I’m terrified of death. I’m terrified of the unknown. Just today I was playing with the idea of mass homicide just to leave a mark on this god forsaken planet. Please don’t contact the authorities. I wasn’t making plans. the idea just popped into my head for some reason. people tell me I’m handsome, but I cant see it. I want to be alone all the time. used to fantasize about being in a padded room and sleeping and dreaming for eternity. My dreams are usually about places I’ve never been and people I’ve never seen. I get deja vu quite often. There’s more, but this is already too long. I don’t know what I’m looking for and I can’t afford a therapist or medication. Any advice or insight would be appreciated. I’ve felt this way for too long.<|im_end|>

 I’m very concerned about your letter. This is no way to live and you have been living in this dark place for so long. I sincerely hope that you will get some help. Your beliefs may be shaped by clinical depression or another psychological disorder, or could be a reaction to negative life events, and both can be treated. Life does not have to be so desolate and full of despair. There are good people all around you and positive life experiences waiting to be perceived. It is easy to develop tunnel vision and only see the negative. It may take some work to open yourself up to a different way of being, but it is worth it.There are community mental health centers that offer services to those in financial need. Please look into what your area has to offer. If you ever feel that you might act on your thoughts of hurting others, please take yourself to the closest ER immediately. It is not fair to hurt innocent people because of your pain, and your pain can be treated.Give yourself a chance to get better. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.All the best,<|im_end|>"

Moving on from heartbreak requires doing exactly what you are doing – moving on.  Making contact with this young woman is a great start. But now you are letting your fear put too much stake in what has only been an intermittent online contact.  Her rate of response may be simply because she is busy. She may be cautious because she has suffered a similar heartbreak. She may not be looking for love and senses that you are. I don’t know. Neither do you.Rather than playing a tortuous guessing game about her motives, why not ask her if she would like to meet for coffee at someplace where both of you would feel safe. Her response to the suggestion will settle your questions. In the meantime, I encourage you to take it slow. Healing takes time. It would be a good idea to make friends with a number of different women and to just hang out for awhile as a way to take the pressure off yourself – and the women you meet. If you do, a relationship is more likely to evolve naturally.I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

I’m 25 weeks pregnant with my first child, his second, and I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing. Before I got pregnant we were into alcohol and weed and clubs and we lived the fast paced city lifestyle. After I got pregnant, I decided to change my life for the better, cut off bad influences, and become a sober parent for my son especially since I know the pain of growing up with drug-abusing parents. My child’s father hasn’t changed any, and he says he doesn’t want to.. not even for our son. He says because of things that happened in the past, he loves me but he doesn’t trust me and he believes after I have my son I’ll go back to my old ways and that my changes are an act. He texts other women in my house, he barely talks to me, and he makes me feel unappreciated in every way. Because I didn’t have a father in my life growing up.. I’ve been trying to keep him around for my baby but, I’m starting to have second thoughts on whether this is more beneficial than it is harmful.. I don’t know what to do. WHATEVER I do needs to be the best possible option for my son.<|im_end|>

  Thank you for asking this. I applaud your decision to manage your behavior in the service of becoming a mom — good thinking. The next thing is to get some legal advice from the local woman’s center. The life-long financial responsibility and other concerns needs to be squarely placed in front of the baby’s father. His opinions, behaviors, and lifestyle need to be secondary concerns to his primary responsibility. The woman’s center can help you with counseling and legal advice. Take care of that first, then worry about if he should be in your life in any other way.– <|im_end|>"

I’m 14. My mom and dad yell at me when i am not happy, or i dont smile. I cant do anything to vent so i scream at them and i get into even more trouble. They dont know whats going on with me, in my head and if i try to tell them they get off topic and start yelling at me even more! Then i go to my room to cool down and they bust in and yell at me even more. I dont know what to do to get them to understand im going through a hard time in school and in my life and yelling is just adding to my stress.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 When people yell, they usually can’t hear each other! I don’t know why your folks are yelling. Maybe they don’t know how to communicate in any other way. What I do know is that it doesn’t help the situation one bit for you to yell back. You are only adding your noise to their noise and no one hears anyone else.You can’t make your folks change. You can work on changing yourself. And you know what? Often when one person in a family makes a consistent change, over time other people start to change too. Even if that doesn’t happen, you need to find better ways to cope and to manage conflict. Otherwise you are going to take this kind of behavior into your own relationships and repeat the whole thing. You already know what it’s like to be a kid in this kind of family. My guess is that you don’t want to do the same thing to your own kids some day.So — here’s what I suggest: Something about hearing your problems unhinges your parents. Maybe they can’t stand to see you unhappy. Maybe they don’t know what to do. Maybe it makes them feel like failures. I have no idea. What I do know is that it doesn’t do any good to argue with them. You need to find another way to deal with your problems and manage your stress.I wonder if there is a relative or another adult friend you can talk to. Many kids your age find that a favorite aunt or grandparent can be really helpful since they understand both the parents’ and the teen’s points of view. No relative? Well – once school starts, you could talk with the school counselor or at least ask where you might find some help. I did an Internet search of your city and found that there are many counseling services that offer help to teens and their families. The school counselor might be able to get your folks to think about doing some family therapy.Meanwhile, if you need someone to talk to, call the counselors at the Boys and Girls Town Hotline. People are there 24/7 to talk to kids just like you and to help them through the rough spots. Here’s their website.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

1. She arbitrarily ‘chooses’ people, distrusts them and thinks of them as liars, amoral, inferior, etc. People arbitrarily chosen are the ones close to me. 2. Thinks her family, her morals and beliefs are ‘superior’ to mine but bends her ‘superior morals’ whenever needed to suit her convenience. 3. My wife has a similar personality. She will make a fuss out of something, call her mother and trigger her off (Eg; During my wedding reception, my parents got carried away greeting guests. My wife blamed my parents for ‘not offering her water on purpose’ – she did not even ask for it. She triggered her mother. Her mother asked me to ‘offer water to a thirsty woman even if I am not willing to feed my wife’. Both women soon got enraged.) 4. Shows dual behavior – first she is this soft ‘parent-of-an-abused-girl-god-believer’, transforms into a raging verbally abusive woman derogating me and my family, cursing death/dismemberment/etc. to my parents. Later, she absolutely denies all she said in her anger and swears on gods that she never lies – I am the liar. 4. Every time we try to speak about these issues, she ‘faints’. My wife says there is ‘no oxygen flowing to her brain’ and asks her father to violently shake her head while blaming me for what happened to her mother. She ‘regains consciousness’ after a few minutes. Opportunity to address problems lost. 5. Recently, she began exhibiting literal split personality. She went into a trance – some ‘god’ had entered her. She said my birth was flawed and that god has come here to save me, threatened my parents with curses and death and asked me to treat my wife well. She physically hits my wife when angry. 6. My wife is very similar – dual behavior – shows affection, romance, we live normally for a few days and then finds a random fault with a sudden mood swing and goes into a rage-crying-despair cycle. In her rage mode she is absolutely uncontrollable. She hits me physically, abuses me verbally, weeps and threatens to call the cops and book me for ‘dowry harassment’, degrades me in front of her mother, plays the victim and so on. 7. My in-laws seem to act mostly on impulse without thoughts about consequences. My wife and FIL both rigidly obey my MIL.<|im_end|>

 The behavior of both your mother-in-law and your wife is unusual. Without being able to interview them in person, a diagnosis is not possible. However, based on what you described, it would seem that they are emotionally unstable and perhaps dangerous. The physical abuse and rage is concerning.If you can help it, limit your contact with your mother-in-law. Interact with her as little as possible. You also should strongly encourage your wife to seek treatment with mental health professionals. If she’s unwilling to seek help, then you should consult a mental health professional. He or she can assess your situation and provide guidance for how you should respond. These issues are significant and cannot be ignored. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

She lived as it was a dump,garbage sitting in the trash for 2 weeks, smell of rotting food,dirty dishes all over the place,wearing weird clothing,not showering… Then when she got fired from her work… She said it was a plot and everyone there was out to get her and stage something to fire her… Few years later shes gets a computer and starts to beleive conspiracy theories (like the goverment creating tornadoes to control the population, mosquitoes injecting people with poisons, vaccines actually putting some min controll thing inside you.. ) Although I dont believe its severe now it will get worse like it is now…<|im_end|>

 I’m sorry to hear about your mother. She is not well. Her denying the fact that she has schizophrenia is not surprising. Some people with schizophrenia are unaware that they have the disorder. This lack of awareness is called anosognosia. Lack of awareness is not a deliberate form of denial; it is a symptom of the disorder.I admire your desire to help your mother but this situation may be too much for you to handle. I’m concerned about the fact that her symptoms seem to be worsening and she is not receiving treatment. It’s also concerning that the house was in such disarray and nothing was done about it. You mentioned your father but did not say much about him. Is he able to assist you and your mother? Is he attempting to help her in any way?I would recommend speaking to your father about your concerns. Advise your father to seek the assistance of mental health professionals. They can help your father to know how to handle this situation with your mother.This is a situation that requires immediate intervention. Many communities have crisis teams trained to deal with mental health crises. Check to see if your community has a crisis team (see the white or yellow pages). If so, call and report what is happening with your mother. They can come to your home, assess your mother’s condition and provide immediate intervention.If you believe that your mother is a danger to herself or your family, call 911 or the police. A person is dangerous to themselves when they aren’t eating, aren’t caring for themselves properly or are deliberately attempting to physically harm themselves. Emergency services can protect your mother and can protect your family. They can also ensure that she receives the proper mental health treatment.

I feel so ashamed about myself and the moment I wake up, the thoughts comes haunting me. Sometimes I feel like I do not deserve to be with my fiancee or to get married to her but this will completely break her down..

 It would have been helpful to have had more details about your “disturbing” thoughts. I do not believe that your thoughts are the main problem; it is the shame that you feel about those thoughts that prevent you from properly dealing with this problem. Shame has prevented you from detailing your thoughts in an anonymous letter. It also stops you from seeking professional help.You are ashamed of your thoughts because of a belief that they portray you in a negative light but the reality is that you have no control over them. Would you feel shame if your appendix burst or if a heart valve malfunctioned? No one should feel shame in those situations because there was nothing that they could have done to have prevented these physical problems. The same logic applies to your thoughts. If you had the power to control your thoughts, you would. You would just stop thinking negative thoughts. You have tried doing just that but it hasn’t worked. You should not blame yourself for something that you have no control over. Trained professionals understand the nature of psychological problems and they can help you with your problem.You have nothing to be ashamed of. You are not to blame. Continuing to blame yourself will only prevent you from receiving the psychological help that could cure this problem. My advice is to see a therapist and to be as honest and as detailed as possible. The sooner that you receive help for this problem, the quicker it will be remedied. Click the “find help” tab, at the top of this page, to locate a qualified therapist in your community.

 I can’t tell you whether you should get a divorce on the basis of only a letter. I can sympathize with your pain and confusion. The situation you describe sounds awful. I’m guessing he is as miserable as you are. He can’t not know that you are turned off by him. It’s to both your credit that you have stayed together this long. I suspect it’s partly because neither one of you really wants your kids to be split between houses and partly because there are still memories of that intoxicating time when there was great sex and passion between you. Sex can be a powerful glue.My best advice is that the two of you should go to see a couples counselor. Counseling isn’t always to help a couple get back together. Sometimes it’s intended to help people learn from their experience and to pull apart in a way that takes care of everyone — you, your husband, and the kids. Even if you do divorce, you two will be co-parenting for years. If your children are to grow up emotionally healthy, you need to reclaim your respect for each other and to operate cooperatively. That alone is good enough reason to spend some time in a counselor’s office. Further, chances are the two of you will also learn things that will help you not make the same mistakes when you start looking for mates again.If he won’t go to see a counselor, please go yourself. You need help to either change this destructive situation or to get out of it.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I’m a 20 year-old female, and in the past I was on the promiscuous side. My downfall started when I was 16, and was coerced into having sex with a 20-year-old guy I wasn’t even into. From there I had several more casual encounters. I acted like I wanted it, and was proud of “being a slut”, but to be honest I died a little on the inside every time.<|im_end|>

 You have struggled with this far too long. From my point of view, your introduction to sex was a rape. Like many rape victims, you tried to gain some sense of control by acting as if casual sex was okay with you. It wasn’t. It isn’t. You are still reacting to that initial experience and to your desperate efforts to resolve it. The result is that you have only two settings for sex: Victim or Disconnected. You don’t mention a single relationship in which sex was a deeply satisfying, loving connection. That’s understandable, given what you’ve gone through, but it’s also very sad.Please consider seeing a therapist to help you resolve your feelings about sex. With some time and attention, you can reclaim your positive sexual self so you can have the loving intimacy in your life you deserve.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I’m sorry you are in such pain. And I’m very sorry that you aren’t going to like my advice. You met this guy online when you were at the very impressionable age of 13. The two of you had a wonderful fantasy about love and relationships that simply won’t hold up as young adults. Although you have powerful feelings for him, they aren’t the feelings of mature love. He can’t be “yours.” People who love each other don’t own each other. You two broke up 3 years ago. He has grown beyond the fantasy and you haven’t. Unfortunately, staying in contact has only helped keep the fantasy going on your part.My guess is that you are afraid of having a real life relationship with a person who is truly available to you. You cover those anxieties with your obsession about a boy you’ve never met. Both wanting a relationship and being scared of what it means is a normal part of the teen years. The way past the fear is to be friendly with guys you like and to start going out in a group to fun activities.If you can’t do that, I do suggest you consider some therapy at this point. Three years is a long time to mourn the break up of any relationship. In your case, it is preventing you from experiencing an important period of personal growth and development. You can and will find real love. But only if you make yourself available for it.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I understand your concern. It is important to keep in mind that your thoughts are just that, thoughts. It is difficult to know for certain what prompted them. I suspect, as does your counselor, that the reason is related to your own unresolved psychological and emotional issues stemming from your less-than-ideal childhood. There is a strong possibility that your negative thoughts are a symptom of your own personal suffering.To believe that you are evil is to pass a moral judgment about yourself but let’s look at the facts. As you wrote, you don’t really want your friend to die. You long for the attention that you might receive from being the friend of an individual who died. In addition, you have guilt about your feelings. As M. Scott Peck discussed in his book about the nature of human evil, evil people are not “blessed by guilt.” Guilt is a blessing to “good” people. Guilt is a blessing because it prevents behavior that would be considered evil or sinful.I would strongly encourage you to discuss this matter with your therapist. The fact that you are bothered by your thoughts makes it a very important and appropriate topic for therapy. You feel shame about your thoughts but it is imperative that you are as honest as possible throughout the course of therapy. The therapy process is stymied when an individual withholds important information.The other aspect of your question is why you continue to need support. An individual who has been damaged during his or her early formative years often experiences psychological problems as an adult. That is the standard psychoanalytic view of psychological problems and it seems to be true for many people. In addition, most people throughout their lives need guidance in some form or another. Needing that guidance is nothing to be ashamed of. Unfortunately, many people believe that needing help is akin to being a failure. It is one of the primary reasons why some people refuse to go to therapy. In their view, needing help is shameful and it’s a sign of weakness. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are not born knowing how to live. The fact of the matter is that life can be very confusing and guidance is often necessary. You have a therapist and many would consider you to be very fortunate. If you have access to the proper guidance, then I would suggest utilizing that valuable resource. I hope this helps. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From S. Africa: My cheating habits started a few years back. I feel that I was pushed into the hands of another woman. My wife hadn’t been working for some years at that time and we just had our second child a few months back. As a sole bread winner it was getting very difficult to support my family. We were very stretched financially. I tried to discuss with her to try find a job but she would have none of it. She would flatly refuse to look for job. I was getting depressed and drowning in debt to try to just to survive. I took up loans and exhausted my credit cards. I felt unloved and unappreciated. This led me to having a fling with a colleague at work. It was mostly sexual than any anything else but it somehow made me feel “loved” again.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You are correct. You are drowning in self-pity and you have a long history of substituting blame for action. You were never “pushed” into someone else’s arms. The fling with the colleague was a decision you made to make yourself feel better. It’s not “unfortunate” your wife found out. It’s the usual outcome of such poor decisions.This is not to say that you haven’t had a troubled marriage for a very long time. It appears that you and your wife never figured out how to be on the same team. You still haven’t. Children have to be fed and cared for. A house has to be kept up. Finances have to be dealt with. Instead of negotiating how to accomplish these tasks together, you or your wife have each taken on tasks and then resented the other person. It’s not a way to make a marriage. Sadly, you have apparently never gone for counseling to learn how to have a cooperative and mutually satisfying life.It’s not too late to save your marriage, unless you two decide it is. You loved each other enough to marry and to bring children into the world. With some hard work you can reclaim that love and learn how to have a mature relationship.Even if you don’t do that, you do need to do some individual work to learn how to be a functioning partner in a functioning relationship. Otherwise, you’ll bring the same lack of problem-solving skills to whatever new relationship you decide to pursue. However much you may think you are in love with the married woman, a relationship with her is bound to fail, if you don’t take responsibility for your part in the failure of your marriage and learn how to forge a different kind of relationship. That’s necessary whether you decide to make another go at your marriage or if you are to be successful as a divorced co-parent of your children or if you decide to start over with someone new.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I am writing this because I have met the most wonderful man, who I love very much and who returns this sentiment. He has been so patient with me and now I fear I have pushed things to breaking point with my constant feelings of jealousy and the mad behavior that ensues. E.g., reading through his phone and email messages, asking him who he was talking to on the phone, how/why he knows female friends, causing scenes in front of his friends if he happens to talk to a girl while he is queuing at the bar. All sorts of things that, if the other way round I would find unacceptable. The problem is I feel like I am going mad. I don’t know why I feel the way that I do because writing it down it doesn’t make sense. I haven’t had a particularly rough time in the past, I have had perhaps one ex that maybe cheated on me but I was never sure. The others have been good guys and yet I am convinced that they are trying to pull one over on me or make a fool of me, are only with me because of the timing and basically feel insecure about the relationship. When I am single I am completely different, outgoing, confident (maybe this is just a front) but as soon as I care about someone deeply I seem to lose the plot, and become (as my boyfriend put it ‘smothering’). I think this insecurity and jealousy that I feel is basically due to low self esteem (I have been with a couple of people who emotionally and verbally abused me). I feel like if I knew what it was to trust someone completely I wouldn’t feel insecure or jealous within the relationship but I just don’t have the confidence to believe that someone wouldn’t prefer someone else to me. For example with my current boyfriend I am constantly trying to find things that will ‘prove’ that he is no good, or that he is encouraging someone. I suppose I just don’t know what it is like to trust someone. Now my boyfriend is saying that he wants some space. Not as in not seeing me, but just time for him to see his friends and socialize sometimes without me there, or without me checking in. I know this is perfectly normal and reasonable and not something he should even have to ask for, yet I completely freaked out, feeling really hurt and rejected. It’s almost as if I enjoy feeling hurt and upset or get a kick out of thinking about his past – which upsets me. I obsess over his ex partners, even though when we first started dating I wasn’t bothered about his past, its only as the relationship progresses that I seem to get more and more insecure as opposed to the other way around? What can I do to stop doing this? I can see I am driving my lovely man away, but I have this almost toilettes like impulsion to say things I know are hurtful because of my jealousy or insecurities – things like – ‘I’m sure your ex-girlfriend was much better than me at that’ or whatever.<|im_end|>

 Your intuition to do some counseling is a good one. The find help tab at the top of the page will help you find someone in your country.The more intimate relationships have different rules of engagement because of the intensity involved. When you are single and dating is casual you don’t have much to lose because the investment isn’t so great. But it sounds like once you are emotionally invested it feels shaky because now have something to lose.Just because you have a feeling of being insecure doesn’t make it real. When you feel these concerns, particularly about your jealousy, you are going to want to challenge these thoughts. I would encourage you to work with a therapist who can teach you the basics of resilience so you can have the thoughts and move past them.The find help tab will give you lists of people in your country. I would explain to the ones you choose to interview that you’re looking to find specific coping skills. This will help them work with you to put a plan of action together to bring about the changes you want.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I think I may be getting depressed. Since my divorce five years ago I have been single with only a couple of casual encounters. My ex was alcoholic and mentally very abusive (not physical) also my childhood was quite abusive with a violent father and a mother (both of whom have died) who was depressed (due to the violence.) Also I have a physical condition called brittle bones, which resulted in me having many broken bones as a child and missing years of schooling. After university and having largely overcome my physical condition I went overseas traveling (in part to test myself and in part to get away from family.) I ended up in the US and married the first person that seemed to care and love me. When I did finally leave my husband after trying to make the relationship work longer than I should I was at breaking point mentally – life held no joy, I was in a low paid menial job and felt that I lacked ability to find something better, that I had no friends and that I was utterly unlovable (my mother told me as a child that she feared no one would love me.) I decided to take a year out and look after myself I went into counseling which was a rewarding and healing experience if very confronting and at time harrowing. I realized that I did have friends who cared for me and as the healing process continued I made many more and feel truly blessed to have these people in my life. My job situation did not improve and after being turned down for another promotion I decided to take time out have a think and see a bit of the world, I spent some months traveling which was mostly wonderful. I returned to the US for the best part of a year and found work with a large company who valued me. I came to realize that as much as I loved my friends in the US I did not have a family and no relationship (and no real hope of one.) I decided to move nearer to my siblings (all in the UK), as with both our parents gone we are all we have. Not wanting to live in the UK I relocated to Germany where I had some friends and as a means of earning money trained as an ESL teacher. Teaching has been a revelation – I never expected to enjoy it but I find it so very rewarding and am motivated to make a go of it and have a two year plan for experience and training (the first time in my life I’ve had such a thing.) My problem is I feel overwhelmingly lonely, when I arrived a friend (who I had feelings for) confessed that he had feelings for me and we began a relationship after two weeks he told me that he changed his mind and didn’t want to continue (but never told me why.) I cannot get rid of the feelings of rejection and that I am doomed never to be or even experience a loving nurturing relationship and that there must be something wrong with me. Despite relocating my relationship with my siblings is almost non-existent – they have made no effort to visit me or reply to my emails. My two sisters are not on speaking terms which meant when I did visit them I had to choose who to see and when, as ever I made the wrong decision and no one sister is not talking to me and the other if she does contact me talks mainly about what is wrong with the other. My brother is the only one of my siblings who even asked about my time in Germany. I feel so lonely and unloved that I often cry (I never realized how much a person can cry.) I have made some other lovely friends since my arrival but as ever they have their own relationships and, well Saturday’s nights and weekends generally are just lonely. I do enjoy the delights of my new home – the museums, art and beauty but it’s always alone. I am at the point where I cannot bear to see people in love (which you see a lot of in Europe!), as it is just a reminder that no one loves me. I know a relocation such as I have undertaken would involve periods of loneliness but I am worried that I may be falling into something more. I don’t seem capable of taking joy in my achievements – relocation, finding a job so fast, finding a beautiful apartment etc. At present I feel as if I could disappear and no one would notice. I am unable to seek counseling here as at present I am only on a part time wage so would welcome any advice you could give me. I apologies as I fear I have taken more than the 400 guide.<|im_end|>

 Give yourself some well-earned credit. There are two primary forces that motivate us in our lives: moving away from pain, and moving toward well-being. You have been able to move away from what was unhealthy. This is a major and essential ingredient in being able to move toward what you want.In the past counseling was helpful, and I suspect it will be helpful again. You may want to look for both an individual and group therapist. The advantage of adding group therapy is that you will be able to get feedback and learn from many others in the group.You have proven to yourself that you can flourish when the right conditions are present. The work now is for you to find the right conditions for your growth. Making new friends, engaging in the process of therapy, and finding a creative outlet will be important ways for you to grow.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I moved to a new state about 5 months ago. I now live in a very small, very rural area, 9 hours from my nearest family member. Today is my birthday and I spent most of the day on my couch alone. The rest was spent shoveling my deck. No one made any effort to spend time with me today.<|im_end|>

 I’m so sorry that you feel so alone. At first, I thought that you are experiencing a normal adjustment to moving so far away from family and friends. But then you said that you have never had the kind of friends you long for. That suggests a much more serious and long-term problem.You indicated in your personal information that you are in grad school. It’s a concern to me that after a whole semester, you don’t know anyone well enough to call them and don’t have anyone’s phone number. Chances are that at least some of your classmates are as new to your new community as you are. Usually the members of a class reach out to each other. If you were seeing me for therapy, I’d be asking you to look at what you have done to initiate contact with others and how you have responded to others’ attempts to know you.You won’t find friends or love by wishing for them. My guess is that you need to take a new look at how you are interacting with others and what you can do to invite others to be your friends. It could be that you aren’t aware of your part in your isolation. If you understood it, you would be taking steps to change it. For that reason, I suggest you make an appointment with a mental health counselor who can help you figure that out.I hope you will follow through and make that appointment. A counselor will be a caring person in your life while you work on developing a natural support system.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Every time I see my dad, the first thing he asks is if any guys are chasing me. He thinks that I need a boyfriend. I’m a Sophomore in college and haven’t had one since my Junior year of high school. I’m fine with not having a boyfriend, though it would be nice to have one. But he is very concerned and is acting like he thinks there is something wrong with my personality, so I need to rely on my looks to get a guy.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 There is nothing wrong with you. There is something very wrong with your dad’s over-involvement with your relationship status. Beyond quietly wishing you the happiness of having a relationship someday, it is none of his business. He has some odd ideas about what makes women attractive to men. He has an equally odd idea about what your priorities should be at this stage of your life. I would hate to think that we women need to “hook” a man in order to be okay. That kind of thinking went out at least 50 years ago.Your letter shows you to be a normal, healthy young woman who would be fine if her dad would just leave the subject of romance alone. There is nothing unusual or inappropriate about not having a boyfriend at your stage in life. Both men and women are getting serious about relationships older. The average age of marriage for women now is 26.5 and for men is 28.4. The days when people felt they needed to be married to be adults, to have financial security, or to have sex, are long over. You have plenty of time. Even though your girlfriends are beginning to find men they call “boyfriend,” it doesn’t mean that all these relationships will last. My guess is that your girlfriends will try out a number of relationships before deciding they’ve found the person they want to spend life with. You’ll probably do the same.You didn’t mention your mother in the letter. If she’s also bothered by your dad’s over-concern, perhaps you can enlist her help in getting your dad to back off. Ditto for your sister. He needs to be told that his comments are out of line. He should instead be celebrating that he has a bright, sensible daughter who likes herself fine.If you are worried about meeting guys because you are shy and reclusive, that’s a different story. In that case, I would encourage you to get involved in some volunteer work or a cause or a club or a job where you will get to know people over time because you are all focused on getting something done. That’s a more natural and productive way for a shy person to find like-minded people than trolling for guys at a bar or using the personals.Please don’t let your father’s comments get you down.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My entire life, I’ve tried to make sense of things and be able to put them into words. When I came across borderline personality disorder, I thought that maybe I had found my answer. I feel like I’m not real. I’ve never been able to jump in with the world. I feel hollow and empty, numb. I have no identity. So no goals, hopes, dreams, interests. There’s nothing to me. I know nothing about myself. I have been depressed for years. That’s the only thing I can feel. I can’t feel joy. I “act in” rather than out. I have self harmed in the past. I do not, however, drink, participate in risky behavior, or have abandonment issues. I have no friends, and have completely isolated and withdrawn. I’d rather be alone, but I’d like to be able to at least have conversation. I’m having hard a time getting a job, forming relationships, and just going on with daily life. I literally feel “out of my mind” like I’m not in my body, or in control to make myself do anything. I just sit and watch as the world blurs around me. So can you have BPD without all the symptoms? Thanks in advance!<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Thank you for writing in with your question. Aside from the emptiness and self-harm behavior, I do not think you are describing Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). There are identity issues with BPD, but it is usually instability of identity (changing frequently) rather than a “lack” of identity. Also, rather than feeling nothing, clients with BPD typically feel lots of feelings, but again, they fluctuate and can be extreme.In personality disorder terms you seem to be describing qualities more similar to Schizoid and Avoidant Personality Disorder than BPD. However, your symptoms could also be accounted for by chronic depression and possibly social anxiety. Seeking the help of a mental health professional would not only be the best way to identify an accurate diagnosis, but also to begin the process of change. It is sad that you have no hopes and dreams and no close relationships. Yet treatment is out there and you are certainly young enough to discover and/or create these aspects of yourself. Life can be much more enjoyable than it has been thus far, but you have to yourself a chance to find out.All the best,<|im_end|>"

 Hello. I suffered from depression from January 2010 to January 2011. Honestly, I think I still suffer from it but, its harder to put a label on it ever since I quit counseling. Now that I am going to start meeting with a new counselor, I need to know how or when to tell my new counselor about my sexuality issues. How do you tell someone something so personal about your life? How do I open up about the issue?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You’ve written an articulate letter about a sensitive topic. I’m sure that there are many people reading it who understand. Sadly, you’re not alone in feeling so alone. Issues of sexuality and family acceptance are often what bring people into therapy.Once you’ve established that you like and trust your new counselor, a simple way for you to introduce the issues is to ask him or her to read your letter. I do think it’s essential that you find some way to do this and do this early. It would be very difficult for a therapist to be effective in treating your depression without understanding such a central issue in your life. We therapists only have whatever people tell us to go on. When information isn’t shared, it’s hard for us to do our best.Although I could venture some guesses about the basis for your beliefs and feelings about sex, I’d be stretching. Such issues are so individual and so complicated, that a general response often entirely misses the point. You’ve been wise to find a counselor who can really get to know and understand you. I urge you to make the commmitment to be a good partner in the effort.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 It’s really, really important to remember that you are the adult and she is the child. You are not competing with her for your boyfriend’s attention. You need adult attention. She needs the love and attention every child needs.I do not think this child is jealous. I think she is traumatized. She is only two and has lost her mother. Separating her from her mom may absolutely be the right thing to do but a little baby doesn’t have any way to understand that. All she knows is that her mother has gone away. It sounds to me like she is clinging to her daddy because, in her baby way, she doesn’t want to lose him too. You and your boyfriend need to talk to a therapist who can help you learn how to help this little girl feel more secure. If you two go forward in this relationship, you will need to do some serious work together for her to understand and learn to relax and to accept you into the family.In the meantime, go slow. You are not going to be able to turn this situation around during a visit so it’s better to not push for change. Start out by just being a friendly person in their lives. She needs time to learn that you are not a threat. You and your boyfriend need time to learn what it’s like when you are on the same couch, not on line. By all means, wait for your turn for your boyfriend’s affection when she is napping or in bed for the night.Please be patient with the situation. Going slow now will pay off in the future.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I was married for 20+ years (I’m 48) and have 2 teen aged children, one at home and one at university. My marriage is over, I am separated, and I am ready to move on. I am still good friends with my ex and we are supportive of each other. 2 years ago I met a man in a very similar situation. He was separated a year before me, and has two children also the same ages as mine. We hit it off immediately, and fell in love. We love each other very much. In the early days of our relationship I told him that one of my goals was to have one more serious relationship in my life and to be living together with that man. He said that he would like that too, one day.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You’re right. He isn’t moving forward. By keeping the two families separate, he is preventing the “blending” that happens when people with children move from “dating” to making a new kind of family.You and your ex have moved past your hurt and anger and have an amicable relationship. When this can happen, it’s best for everyone. The children aren’t conflicted about spending time with either parent. The parents aren’t still living in old pain. This is what it means to move on. Three years after the breakup, your boyfriend isn’t on speaking terms with his ex’s partner. It appears he was so hurt by the breakup of his marriage that he can’t take the risk to start again.That’s sad. Your relationship sounds like it has promise. All you can do is try to talk to him about it. In a way, he is letting his “controlling” ex still control how he lives his life. His reaction to her behavior is holding him back.He might find it useful to talk to a therapist to help him resolve his feelings about his prior marriage and divorce. Another route to go would be for the two of you to see a couples therapist – together – to help you find ways to reassure him and to help him trust you and your relationship as being different from him first marriage.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hello…I planned to do technique called (Image Streaming) to increase my IQ and this technique will increase the intensity of inner voice of me and I am afraid if this technique would cause psychosis or schizophrenia or any mental disorder to me So,is it possible?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 To the best of my knowledge, image streaming is not something that has been rigorously studied by the scientific community. I could find no peer-reviewed studies about this technique. There are books written about it, but they have not been subjected to peer review. Peer review is a critical element of the research process. It involves new ideas being thoroughly vetted by expert researchers. Without empirical validation, you should be skeptical of claims being made about image streaming.Because image streaming is not something that has been well studied, it’s impossible to answer your question about whether or not it would cause a mental health disorder. You might consider consulting a mental health professional, in-person, to address your concerns. This would allow you to explain the process of image streaming to the therapist and he or she could offer an opinion.Generally speaking, you should avoid engaging in any behavior that has not been scientifically validated and might negatively impact your mental health. If your neighbor down the street came up with a new drug to make you smarter, would you swallow the pill? It could make you smarter. It could make you dead. It might damage your brain and make you less intelligent.No drug manufacture can offer a pill that has not been scientifically proven. First of all they need to know if it will harm you and secondly they need to prove, through scientific testing, that it works. Anyone can claim anything, but only scientific testing can prove a claim to be true. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

How can I tell if I have depression or if I’m just a moody teenager? I’ve taken many online surveys before, including the SanityScore one, and they all say I have “Severe Depression” but I’m still skeptical. I have extreme mood swings, I feel hopeless and worthless sometimes, I feel like I can’t control anything in my life, but then sometimes I think I’m just overreacting. I think that there are people who have it worse than I do, and that I should just stop thinking about it. I sort of want to bring the idea up to my mom, but I don’t want her to judge me. I wrote a letter to her but I haven’t given it to her yet. Do you have any advice?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
You have asked a very good question. It’s probably a question that many teenagers and parents have pondered. To give you the best answer I would need to interview you. My questions would be geared toward determining the seriousness of your symptoms. I would want to know information such as how frequently the symptoms disrupt your life, to what degree and whether you have contemplated or attempted suicide. Your answers to those questions could help me to determine whether you have depression.From what you have written, it does seem that your symptoms are significant and concerning. Having extreme mood swings is not normal. Many individuals will occasionally experience periods of irritability but it’s unusual to have “extreme” mood swings.The National Institute of Mental Health website states that “if you have been experiencing some of the following signs and symptoms most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks, you may be suffering from depression:”“Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood Feelings of hopelessness, or pessimism Irritability Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities Decreased energy or fatigue Moving or talking more slowly Feeling restless or having trouble sitting still Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions Difficulty sleeping, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping Appetite and/or weight changes Thoughts of death or suicide, or suicide attempts Aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems without a clear physical cause and/or that do not ease even with treatment”NIMH also goes on to say, “Not everyone who is depressed experiences every symptom. Some people experience only a few symptoms while others may experience many. Several persistent symptoms in addition to low mood are required for a diagnosis of major depression, but people with only a few – but distressing – symptoms may benefit from treatment of their “subsyndromal” depression. The severity and frequency of symptoms and how long they last will vary depending on the individual and his or her particular illness. Symptoms may also vary depending on the stage of the illness.”You mentioned feeling hopeless and worthless. You didn’t specify how often you feel that way. Teenagers especially may experience those feelings occasionally and that may be relatively normal. To experience them on a regular basis (a few times a week) would be abnormal. You also feel that you can’t control anything. I am not certain what you meant by that expression but usually that feeling is associated with anxiety. Depression and anxiety commonly co-occur. I wonder how often you feel out of control and if you have a reaction to that feeling.I tried to provide a nuanced answer but the simple answer is this: If you feel depressed then you should seek help. It’s not advisable to let your depression symptoms worsen before you decide that treatment is warranted. It’s better to be proactive and treat the symptoms as soon as you notice them occurring. You already have a letter written to your mother. The next step would be to give it to her. It is important that she knows how you are feeling. It would be helpful for you to discuss this with her and put a plan in place to make an appointment with a professional. Please take care. Thanks for writing.<|im_end|>"

From Canada: My brother started by reading about the chi power and other stuffs related to it. He is 15 years old and in 10th grade of high school. After almost 2 months, he told mom that there is no reason for him to study, this is not what he wants to do and that he will work a part time job to get money to rent his own apartment, and that he will take a career related to the power and soul stuffs that he reads about.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Your brother is lucky, indeed, to have such a caring sister. Unfortunately, you and your mother probably can’t convince him as long as you are in a fight with him. Although I absolutely agree with you that it would be better for him to finish high school, I know that fighting with a teen who is on a mission never goes well.It might be more effective to talk with him about how he can get ready to leave. That means getting an after school job and saving enough money to be able to get that apartment. It means identifying and learning whatever skills he needs to successfully live on his own.Does he know how to shop, make decent meals, do his own laundry and manage money? Does he have a realistic budget for what he will need to support himself? Does he have enough money in the bank to buy a used car when he is old enough? Does he know what he needs to do to maintain one?Don’t overwhelm him. Do have a serious talk. Stress that you do want him to be successful out there but you are concerned. He won’t be at home for the important years when most young people make the transition to adult life. Sincerely offer to give him a crash course over the next months or year to help learn what he needs to know to be independent and successful. If he takes you up on it, do keep your end of the bargain. He needs to learn those skills for independence regardless of what he decides to do about school.Meanwhile, encourage him to teach you as much as he can about the power of chi. See if you can come to an understanding of why it is so important to him. If you express interest, he may not need to be in such a fight. If you learn more, you may be able to have a more useful conversation with him about what he needs to do to pursue that interest and be taken seriously in the world.You may not be able to get him to stay in school. That would be a shame because it is much harder to get a high school degree as an adult. But it can be done.

Hello. I am concerned lately as to the state of my mind in relation to psychosis. I have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, however the symptoms I am experiencing fall out of the regular signs associated with this personality disorder.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Research shows that individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) can experience brief states of depersonalization, hallucinations, paranoia and suspicion. They can also experience psychosis-like symptoms such as feeling as though they are losing their grip on reality. The symptoms you described may be part of BPD. I cannot say for certain whether your symptoms are associated with BPD or if they are a sign of another disorder such as schizophrenia but generally speaking, your symptoms are fairly consistent with BPD.I would recommend having a psychiatric evaluation. An evaluation would be helpful in determining whether your symptoms constitute the development of schizophrenia. As I remarked above, your symptoms seem consistent with BPD but it is important to rule out a possible developing psychosis or schizophrenia diagnosis.You did not mention whether you are in treatment. If not, you should be. It would be difficult to experience the many frightening symptoms you have described. I get the impression that you may feel like you are living in a fog, not sure of what is real and what is not. This is not a healthy way to live.Psychotherapy may help to address symptoms such as mood instability, racing thoughts, confusion and memory loss. Medications might be helpful as well. Medicine may be particularly helpful for hallucinations and paranoia. Some physicians prescribe a low-dose antipsychotic to treat hallucinations and paranoia in individuals with BPD. Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have been found to be helpful for mood instability. These are all treatments you could explore with a therapist and a physician, preferably a psychiatrist because of their additional training in mental health.Here’s a link to Psychology Today where you can search for a therapist in your community. Many individuals with BPD prefer to consult a therapist who is specially trained to work with this population. If possible, I would recommend you do the same. Thank you for your question.<|im_end|>"

My fiance and I have been together for 4 years. About a year into our relationship I had to take a break from it because I had a history of violent sexual abuse that I had to get help for and our relationship was hard for me to participate in during that time. About 3 months into our break we started going out on dates and working toward getting back to normal, but we were not officially together. During this time of dating and him pursuing me he had sex with another girl. 3 years passed and he never told me about the incident — since that happened we had moved in together and he asked me to marry him. I recently found out about the sex because he left his email logged on to my computer and he was emailing her an apology for his poor behavior with her. This is the first time he has been physical with another girl, but during other parts of our relationship I have caught him sexting his ex and at one point I found him texting one of his peers at school telling her that he didn’t get enough attention from me and he wanted to kiss her and see if she was the thing missing from his life. I don’t know how to proceed with him. I love him very much and our wedding is in 2 years but I’m not sure after all of this if it is even worth the work it will be to fix our relationship. So should we work it out or should throw in the towel?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Don’t throw in the towel until you sort through what has happened. Couples counseling right now is important. There’s a lot invested here, and it seems as if your prior history and break up is playing a part in this. You do not want to go forward in a relationship with a person you cannot trust. Yet it seems there is much working with the two of you.Take the time to explore what is happening in couples therapy. Get a third person opinion from the therapist and bring the issue out where someone skilled can help you determined if trust can be re-established. If it can’t, then you throw in the towel and take the lessons forward. If it can, you’ll have established a better foundation on which to build.

I know there have been many in my situation, but I have yet to find a submission that has presented a clear answer to help with my situation. In October 2009 my wife found out I was cheating with a co-worker. I did not feel comfortable telling her all of the details at first so I continued lying as I felt I was protecting her already fragile state. I have been a liar since I can remember and I don’t know how to stop. I realize I personally make the decision to lie every time I do it, but that doesn’t seem to get in the way when it comes down to making a decision whether or not to lie. We have severe financial problems and will more than likely lose our home. My wife has told me we won’t be married after she graduates from nursing school but we haven’t separated yet because we have 3 children together and she doesn’t have an income. I have been getting payday loans to subsidize my income and have paid a significant amount towards those loans to keep things as normal as possible for the kids. So goes the lying. I get loans my wife doesn’t know about to keep things normal and she always finds out I have been getting money somewhere and I end up telling her the truth. She says I am childish for always lying and adds what I’ve done to the list of reasons we are getting divorced. I told her tonight I fear for my life sometimes because she doesn’t seem to have control over herself when she is in a fit of rage over what I’ve done. She has made comments in the past that she would “stab me” and she would “get off” if she were to kill me (because I cheated). I know what I did to her was terrible and I feel like a terrible person every day. I live in a manic world to keep myself from going off the deep end. I have been told I can’t leave my house because I will be abandoning my children and the courts will not award any custody to me if I do. She, however, wants me to leave immediately. I told her about my fear and she got extremely angry, told me I was selfish and started crying because that statement meant I didn’t care about what I put her through. The fact is, I didn’t know how to help her. I let myself get in the way a lot since she found out and she wouldn’t let me provide comfort when she was in pain. I have never, nor will I ever inflict harm on her, but I fear her statement are true and the mental anguish I have caused is the reason she cut herself some this past year and almost overdosed on drugs. I am writing this because I want to stop lying. I am writing this because I want to know how to get out of the situation I am in without a huge legal mess. I love my kids; I love to be around them. If I had my choice I would never leave their sides. I can’t, however, feel like I am a good parent for allowing them to live in the environment I have created. My wife has not recovered to the point where she can get out of bed at a decent hour and function with them. For months after she found out she would sleep most of the day while they were left to fend for themselves. I didn’t know what to do because I feared I would lose my job and make things even worse. PLEASE HELP!! Or, help me to find a good counselor in my area that accepts my insurance. I can’t afford to pay the co-pays all the time so that has kept me from going. The last counselor I had fell asleep in the chair while I was talking.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I am glad that you are making an effort to reach out and seek some help. The find help tab at the top of the page will help you find a counselor in your area. See if you can negotiate a sliding scale fee where the co-pay can be reduced. You may also want to look into the offerings at your local hospital for an outpatient program that will accept your insurance. I mention this first because you will need to have therapy to go through the changes I am suggesting.I can’t give you legal advice, but I can encourage you to seek several opinions. Your wife wants you to leave and you are looking to do the right thing—so the question becomes how to make that happen. Your wife may want to get the names of some lawyers from the local women’s center. Often lawyers connected with a women’s center are savvy when it comes to helping with legal issues surrounding separation and divorce. You need someone with a great deal of experience legally in this area and getting more than one opinion is important. Often psychological needs and legal issues clash, but you won’t be the first couple to be in this dilemma. Learn how others have found a legal way through. Otherwise the situation tends to get worse as couples marinate in their own negativity. Let’s not wait for something drastic to happen before making a change that sounds necessary.People who continually lie to others are usually lying to themselves. It sounds like you need to start taking much greater responsibility for yourself, your situation, your children’s future and your own. Ask yourself what your truth is and begin with that.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

 I don’t feel anything. I have no attachments to most of the population. Other than about 15 people that I actually care about, the rest of the world could die tomorrow and they’d just be names on a piece of paper to me. Including my wife and children. I genuinely don’t care about them. I know according to society and psychology that should bother me, but it doesn’t.<|im_end|>

 The one missing element in your letter was what may have preceded your feeling desensitized. You listed your occupation as “military.” Is it possible that your desensitization may have been the result of your military training or experience? Military training often involves the use of virtual reality systems. That training has been found to increase desensitization. It is also common for soldiers to return home, especially those who have experienced combat and war, and feel disconnected from the world.Desensitization involves the inability to feel emotions. It’s akin to emotional numbness. This may happen as a defensive mechanism. Think of a defense mechanism as a psychological protection system. They are involuntary and unconscious and are meant to reduce psychological stress. Desensitization is also a common feature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).There are multiple, evidence-based treatments for PTSD including cognitive behavioral therapy and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy (EMDR). You should strongly consider visiting a mental health professional. Your local Veterans Affairs hospital should be able to help you.Recent longitudinal studies have indicated that the majority of people experience transient mental health symptoms at some point during their lives. In other words, we all struggle from time to time. It is nothing to be ashamed of because it happens to virtually everyone. If you’re willing to seek treatment, you will likely experience a positive outcome. I hope that you will consider it. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

After we got engaged, my fiancé masturbates 1-3 times per night in bed next to me. This starts as soon as the TV is turned off. It wakes me up every night, and I end up sleeping in a different room. When I asked him about it, he got upset, called me a “crazy person” and said maybe I was sexually abused earlier in my life; why else would I think that? He said he is a good, Christian man that would never do anything like that and he is horrified that I would think he would do this in bed next to me. He says he wants proof he is doing it, which of course, I don’t have. There is no evidence. He is a good man, and a man I want to marry, but I don’t know how to marry a man that I can’t sleep next or that lies to me about this. I know he is faithful, but we have no sex life. Do we need counseling before we get married? Please help.<|im_end|>

 Anybody who responds so vehemently can’t have your best interest at heart. This is important. Don’t let yourself be swayed by his reaction. Explain that you’re bothered enough that you are leaving the bed. This isn’t your problem alone — both of you are involved in. While the issue is of a different caliber, countless couples go through this with one accusing the other of snoring. The offender is often unaware and demands evidence. Your husband may not know he is doing it, he may be lying, but in either case if you are being woken regularly — it needs to be resolved. Explain that a sexless relationship and calling you a crazy person isn’t the life you are looking for. On the other side of the coin, the next time you are woken up by this reach over and find out exactly what’s happening.Whatever is happening I think couple’s therapy would be a good idea.

From the U.S.: My divorced parents are using me to get information about each other to use in their child support trial.

 A: What you do is exactly what you want to do: Stop being the mediator, translator and soft shoulder for both of them. There is no way you can participate in the argument between your parents without hurting your relationship with both of them. Leave it to them and their lawyers to work it out.Do not fall into conversations with either parent about what’s right, just or fair. Do not let either of them tell you secrets and swear you to secrecy. It’s inappropriate for them to do so. It’s equally inappropriate for you to even pretend to listen. Simply remind each of your parents that you love them both and that this is their problem to figure out, not yours. People can be wonderful parents even though they were terrible partners. You have a right to have a loving relationship with each of your folks, even if they can’t even talk to each other.I do suggest you contact the behavioral health services at your college and make an appointment with a counselor — not because I think you are ill but because I think the situation is understandably distressing. You need to be able to vent to someone without worrying about tales being carried to either parent.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From a 18 year old girl in Sweden: I enjoy getting in relationships only to completely destroy the person later on. Or well, not really. I enjoy it in the moment. I get all gittery and giggly and I feel really good inside. It’s not a sexual thing either, it’s just fun. I feel like life without hurting others would be boring and mundane.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 When I read your letter, my first thought was “What happened to this person that created this problem?” Generally, people who want to hurt others have been terribly hurt themselves. If you were seeing me for therapy, I’d want to explore whether your thoughts of violence are a way you try to protect yourself. Thoughts of violence certainly give you the feeling of being in control or having the upper hand.If that isn’t part of the picture (or if it’s only a part of it), I’d want to talk with you more about the “switch” — tracking when and how it happens.Obviously I can’t do any of this. I do think what you are describing is serious enough that you should make an appointment with a therapist who can. You don’t like these feelings. You are concerned about them. You are scaring people you care about. Those are all good reasons to get an assessment from a mental health professional. It may be that you just need some reassurance. Or it may be that you need some healing. You and the therapist will decide the best way to help you.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Me and my boyfriend have been going out for about 6 months, and he’s NEVER given me any reason to not trust him. He’s never cheated, lied, or anything remotely close to that. He’s always been honest with me and never fails to be affectionate and tell me how much he cares about me. But I can’t trust him. And I get extremely bad separation anxiety when I’m not with him. I always want to try and control him, who he’s with, where he goes, what he’s doing, and I never want him to do anything if I’m not involved. Which, clearly isn’t healthy at all. I get so anxious and jealous about everything he does that I’m not there for. And it’s starting to ruin our relationship.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Thank you for writing. I agree. If you don’t get hold of this, you’re going to lose a great guy. No one wants to live with this level of jealousy and distrust. It’s not fair to him for you to treat him like someone he’s not. And it’s not fair to yourself to hold onto the hurts from a prior boyfriend.What you can do at this point is get yourself into some therapy. Medication isn’t going to fix these issues. Therapy will. You need help to recover from being betrayed and badly hurt. If you could recover on your own, you would have done it already. You’re clearly motivated. You just don’t know how to go about it.Meanwhile, you can ask your boyfriend to put up with your behavior while you work on yourself. If he knows you’re in treatment, he may be able to stand it awhile longer — especially if you also focus on the good times.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I’m 17. I’ve suffered from depression since i was 15, have recently been diagnosed with Crohns disease, and on a daily basis i suffer from chronic migraines. Now that’s not just it. what im here to ask is for your professional opinion on how to deal with my mother. Right now shes unemployed and basically a single parent. My father was sent to prison leading me to fall into depression. I stopped eating for a while and started cutting. But then one night i did attempt suicide. After that i realized i needed professional help and my mom helped me get that (at the time i was 15 when that happened) i attended therapy for a few months on and off then it eventually came to an end and i figured i didnt need that help anymore things appeared to be better.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m very, very sorry that you have so much to deal with. Your letter shows you to be a sensitive young woman who is trying extra hard to be fair in spite of it all.I wish I had a recipe for making it all better. Unfortunately, I don’t. I would need a whole lot more information to come up with a solution to the fighting. For that reason, I’m recommending that you call up that therapist. You had a successful experience with therapy before. Why not give it another round? Once you’ve made a relationship with a therapist, you have a resource you can return to whenever you need to. She will know your story up to when you left so you don’t have to start completely over. Therapy can help you sort out how best to handle your situation. You could also invite your mom to join you so the two of you could work on your relationship.While you wait for an appointment, please remember this: Someone can only fight if someone else fights back. You have some responsibility – and some power – in this situation. Just because someone invites you to a fight doesn’t mean you have to participate. You could just say something like, “I’m sorry you feel that way” as gently and respectfully as possible, promise to try to do better (there’s always room for us to do better) and go about your business.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I am looking for some insight on a very personal matter that no body knows about me. Not even my parents. I have seen numerous posts on reddit that detail early signs and symptoms of psychopathy and I’m just a bit concerned. I do by no means believe I am a psychopath but I am aware that I may be a bit more prone to mental illness (My granddad and Aunt were Manic Depressive). I know I should seek proper counseling and not ask questions online but I’m curious to hear your opinions on the matter. What it boils down to are my actions as a child. It began even before my stepfather (who played a huge role in my teenage turmoil) came in to my life. I have a memory (it grows weaker by the day) of being around 4-5 years old and sadistically chasing my mums canaries around a room with a hammer. Although I don’t remember killing them I do remember running around the room with the hammer and also when my mum asked me what happened to them. I asked her about this recently and she said she cant remember anything. The next instance was when I was 9 years old. My Stepfather had a baby boy with my mum. There were multiple occasion where I would twist his arm to make him cry, the crying would irritate me and I would twist it more because of this. Unfortunately I broke his arm one time (This my parents found out about of course). I don’t want any judgement on this please. The baby was only maybe 8 months old and of course I am disgusted by what I did but I’m looking for insight not j udgement. The last sadistic behavior I remember was at about 10-11 years old. One of my cats gave birth to 4 kittens and I am pretty sure I caused the death of all four. I would be in the room on my own and I would press down on their stomachs to make them squeal. Although they never died on the spot they passed away pretty quickly and I am sure I caused some major internal injuries. I remember some of the moments very clearly but what I remember mostly was the guilt. In particular when my brother would scream in pain I would have the feeling wash over me instantly and I would keep doing it for some reason. It was the same feeling I got from telling him that his mam and dad weren’t ever coming back (Parents gone in to the shop, me and brother in the car) I will finish up by saving that I consider my self a normal young adult right now. I have some issues with anxiety but I put that down to smoking grass. But I’m just wondering if this behavior as a child could manifest itself again in my later years when my mental health starts to deteriorate. P.S I have a great relationship now with my family and stepfather who actually provided my mum with two more kids after this. They mean the world to me so I’m curious as to where this behavior stemmed.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I don’t think there are easy answers to your questions. Part of the problem in providing a definitive answer is that memory is fallible. Your first memory is fading and cannot be corroborated by your mother. Therefore, it may not have actually happened.Your childhood behaviors are concerning, but they may not be indicative of psychopathy. There are many reasons why children behave the way they do. You could’ve been acting out of frustration or curiosity. It’s important to remember that children and adults are very different. Children are not mini-adults. Developmental science supports that view. Children are still developing and maturing and therefore are held to a different standard than adults. Children, who commit crimes, are typically adjudicated under laws that apply to children and receive a much less severe punishment than when adjudicated as an adult. They are held less responsible because they are less responsible.Psychopathy is not a diagnosis that can be found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM-5), the book that mental professionals use to diagnose mental health disorders. If psychopathy is suspected in adulthood, they might receive the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder. If psychopathy is suspected in childhood, a diagnosis of conduct disorder may be given. Conduct disorder represents a group of behavioral and emotional problems including: aggression to people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness, theft, and violating parental and societal rules. Simple displaying one of these behaviors would not be enough to warrant a diagnosis of conduct disorder.The fact that your problematic behaviors have faded is a good sign. There’s also evidence that you felt guilt. Psychopaths typically don’t feel guilt.You may never know why you did what you did but thankfully those problems seem like a thing of the past. However, there is one concern that you seem to be minimizing, which is the anxiety associated with marijuana use.Recreational marijuana use is becoming more acceptable but that doesn’t make it any safer. Anecdotally, I receive many letters from people who smoke marijuana and have developed a host of negative symptoms including anxiety and derealization. Scientific studies have indicated that marijuana use increases the possibility of psychosis. Continuing to use marijuana is risky. It can be difficult to stop using drugs. You might consult a therapist who can help. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 hi i am 25 years old. I am still a virgin and have only messed around with my ex of 5 years. I cant help it i try not to get scared and tense up but every time i came close to having sex with him i would tense up and make it impossible. i tend to do the same thing when i go to the gyno i make it impossible for them to do an exam. I cant even use tampons. how can i get over this i want to be able to have sex and get married and have kids. I am pretty sure my ex fiance who i was with for 5 years left me and got with someone else because i couldn’t have sex. please help<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I hope you have a gynecologist who will talk to you about how to solve the problem and not just give up on trying to do an exam. If not, change your doc! There are a number of reasons that sex can be painful for a woman. Vaginismus is a muscle spasm that happens when a woman attempts intercourse. Then there’s genital warts, herpes, or other STDs, an injury or infection, or problems with the ovaries, uterus, or cervix. So the first thing to do is to make sure that you are physically okay by having a thorough physical exam.If everything checks out medically, it may be that you are right to diagnose the situation as “fear.” Once a woman has had a painful experience, it’s common for her to brace against pain. That tension causes the very pain she was trying to avoid. Then the next time she tries to have sex, she braces even more which makes penetration even less likely. Over time, the situation gets worse and worse.If that’s the case with you, please consider talking with a psychologist or social worker who has experience treating such problems. You can learn new ways to manage your fears so that you can relax. You and your partner can learn ways to help you calm and get ready so that you can enjoy the closeness of an intimate relationship.I’m glad you were motivated to write. You don’t need to give up on having the intimacy of a sexual relationship. It’s probably that you just need the right treatment.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I can’t help but wonder why you hate your sister so much when your parents are the problem. They have raised her to behave this way! She’s still a self-centered teen. Eventually, she will ask the same question. But for now, she is getting away with what she can as a way to prove that she is her own person. It’s not attractive, but it is typical.Why not try to have a talk with your parents? Is there a secret that makes them want to coddle your sister? Have they just run out of steam? Do they need help for parenting a child who is so different from you?You are old enough to get past petty sibling rivalry and to ask questions instead of making accusations. it sounds to me like they need help, not recriminations. If that’s the case, only you can decide if you are the person most able to provide the help or whether you want to recommend that they talk to a therapist or another helpful resource.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 Yes, you have a disease. It’s called adolescence The teen years make most people uneasy in lots of ways for a time. Please understand that I’m not being dismissive or disrespectful. I understand completely that it is confusing and painful to be in turmoil about so many things. You are asking the big important questions about values, compassion, morality, and mortality. You’re trying to figure out who you are and what kind of person you want to be. None of that is easy. But fortunately, your mind and emotions will settle down over time.You will get through it faster if you start focusing on doing good things in the world for other people instead of thinking so much about whether there is something wrong with you. If you really want to get better, join a service club, do some volunteering, and look for opportunities to do random acts of kindness. Research shows that doing positive things at a ratio of 3 – 5 to 1 (3 – 5 positive things for every negative one) builds people’s self-esteem and has all kinds of positive benefits.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 You are not weird for wanting to understand things. It is your brain we’re talking about.You are a central member of your treatment team. You need to have sufficient information to make informed decisions about medications. The doctors need you to be able to accurately report effectiveness and possible side effects. So please don’t back off looking for answers to your questions.The members of the Ask the Therapist team are psychologists and social workers, not medical doctors. You need to be taking your questions to a psychiatrist (MD) or a pharmacist.I urge you to have a frank discussion with your prescriber about your concerns. It’s absolutely appropriate for you to request literature to help you understand what a medication is supposed to do. It’s very important to ask about drug to drug interactions as well as drug to food interactions.If you are at all inclined to change the dosage or timing of your medications on your own, please don’t. Work with your treating physicians.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My ex re-appeared before my wedding. That was three years ago. I have been talking to him secretly, even though I love my husband dearly. However, for different reasons. My husband is loving, loyal and a great provider -however our chemistry/sexual passion is not where it should be. On the other hand my ex and I were over the top in that department. He only says he wants sex from me and nothing serious.I have seen him twice to talk, but not so much as touched him- as I do not want to dishonour my husband or myself.)Is this just a case of reclaiming what was his? I think I am in love with him and I think I would leave my husband to be with him if he seriously wanted another relationship. The thing is, I am unsure if he can be trusted, or ever will…what should I do?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You said that you do not want to dishonor your husband or yourself, but you are actually achieving both by secretly talking to and meeting with your ex. There are many marriages, a surprising number of marriages, that are open sexually. Both the husband and the wife engage in sexual practices with other people. These marriages seem to have no higher a failure rate than marriages where both parties are monogamous.When a spouse has a sexual affair, without the knowledge of their partner, the problem is not the actual sexual act but is instead the deception and lies that came with the affair. If you don’t believe me, ask anyone whose spouse has had an affair. What was the overwhelming problem? What thought filled their mind and did not allow them to sleep or function normally? Here’s what I’ve heard, in my counseling practice, over and over again. “How can I ever trust my spouse again?”When I attempt to save these marriages, the issues that I will deal with, the problems in a relationship, will all deal with trust. Quite naturally and normally the person that was cheated on, who I will now referr to as the “cheatee” will have major problems believing and trusting the cheater. That makes sense and it will take not months but years to once again trust the cheater. That’s assuming that the cheater has been completely trustworthy over that period of time.The second problem, which the layperson would not assume, will come from the cheater’s perspective. The cheater very quickly becomes tired and annoyed by being treated as if they are not trustworthy, which of course they are not and have proven that to be true with the deception and lies that they have committed during the course of their affair.Quite erroneously, the cheater believes that they can re-earn the trust of their spouse in a matter of days or perhaps a few weeks. Nothing could be further from the truth. It will take several years of fully trustworthy behavior for the cheater to be trusted once again.My advice to you? Immediately cease all contact with your ex-boyfriend. No phone calls, text messages, e-mails, Internet contact of any kind, is acceptable. If he works out at the same exercise facility as you do, quit and find a new place to exercise. If he works at the garage where you bring your car for repairs, find a new garage. If you share mutual friends, make it clear to your friends that they are not to discuss your ex-boyfriend with you in any manner. If they do not respect your wishes, end your relationship with them.Work on your marriage. If all is well with the marriage except for the sexual element, see a marriage counselor or sex therapist. Do this of course as a couple. If you are dissatisfied with your marriage and the therapy does not help, then you should end your marriage.It is normal to have feelings for people that you used to love. They may always have a soft spot in your heart but your loyalty and devotion belongs to your spouse. Do your best to maintain the sanctity of your marriage. You will never regret having done so.I hope things work out for you and I wish you the best of luck.<|im_end|>"

My problem started when i started seriously training in ballet. I loved ballet and considered it my life. Around the age of 12 my mother made it seem to me that ballet was the only thing i could do in my life and i had no other option but to do it. Ballet made me hate myself, i constantly felt like i was not good enough and even my teachers would tell me i wasnt good enough. So i quit ballet and everything went downhill from there. I made a bad decision just like im sure every teenager has done once in their life. I went to hang out with friends during the day without telling my parents when i moved 1000 ft away. instead of being grounded for a week or two i was told all of these horrible things such as your a failure, your a disappointment, your a whore, your a slut, no one likes you, your trash, you have no real friends, kill yourself. Ever since then (that was around 6 months ago) ive been told that every day. My whole life has been one bad event after an other and nothing ever seems to get better. I have no one to talk to about how i feel and dont know how to fix this. I feel like nothing will ever be better for me and im starting to believe that i am what my mom tells me. I cry every day for at least 4 hours. I dont sleep at night anymore. I eat junk food constantly. I however have still managed to focus in school and get good grades because i know if i do that the closer ill be to leaving my parents and finding happiness. These past 6 months I’ve never felt worse and things haven’t worked out for me in even the slightest bit. I feel like if im living in this house with someone who sees me a certain way and accuses me of being someone im not, the only way out is to kill myself. Ive tried many times but get stopped by fear. I have been to a therapist once before but my parents never allowed me back. I need something worth living for. All of my happiness has been taken from me. I dont know why they dont love me like i love them.<|im_end|>

The words of your mother are mean and hurtful. It’s unclear why she would say them. Personal problems may be causing her to treat you badly. Nevertheless, it’s abuse.I’m curious about your father’s role in your life. Does he know how your mother treats you? Is he someone with whom you can talk? Would he be willing to take you to a therapist? If you haven’t talked to him, you should try. He needs to know how she treats you. Make him aware of how you are feeling and that you’ve thought about suicide. This is a serious matter. She is abusing you and he needs to know about it.When a parent is abusive, it’s common for children to blame themselves. How your mother behaves is a reflection of her character and or the problems in her own life. It has nothing to do with you. Understandably, it feels personal because it’s directed at you but it is not about you. Something is wrong with her.Consult the school guidance counselor about this matter. Tell them how you’re feeling and what’s happening. They can assist you in receiving the proper treatment. If not the school guidance counselor, then tell a school faculty member or another trusted adult. Go to the hospital or call emergency services if you feel that you might harm yourself. They will ensure that you are safe and protected. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From a teen in India: My mom has not been getting along with my dad for some time now. Its making the entire environment of the house very intense. Its like sitting on a time bomb and trying to get it to explode. My mom, she’s very career oriented and we all support that through whatever she needs,<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
It was not wise of your mother to share information with you that is painful for you and that you can do nothing about. But what is done is done. I suspect that your dad is well aware that your mom is distancing herself from him.This is a matter between your parents. Although you may want your parents to get counseling, you can’t make it happen. If your dad wants to keep the marriage, he needs to face the problems. It might be helpful for him to get into counseling and then to urge your mom to join him.It’s important for you to remember that parents who can’t find a way to get along with each other can still have solid and loving relationships with their kids. Focus on your relationship with each of them separately. At 18, you are about to launch your own adult life. Although it complicates things, you don’t need your parents to be sharing a household to be close to each of them.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I’m 23 and up until about 4 years ago, I was outgoing, had a big social circle, and a part time job I had maintained for a couple years. Since then, I’ve somehow become very depressed, self-hating, antisocial and have terrible anxiety whenever I’m obligated to a work or social situation, sometimes even when it’s just a family get together. It gets so bad that I’ve quit about 8 jobs in the past 4 years. It’s very hard to explain it in writing, but it feels uncontrolable when I start to feel the anxiety and apprehension. It’s embarassing and I feel like a child having a temper tantrum but I can’t stop it. I’ve gone as far as hysterically crying until my boyfriend told me I didn’t have to go into work, I’ve pretended to go but actually went somewhere else to kill time, or I’ve just stopped showing up to work all together and never called. It sounds so irresponsible, spoiled, and childish which is why it’s so hard for me to talk about because I can’t convey the way it feels to me inside. I prefer to spend my time alone in my apartment or with my boyfriend only and I don’t understand why it’s so hard for me to be around other people. My family growing up was very dysfunctional and my parents were verbally and sometimes physically abusive toward one another my entire childhood. I can still to this day vivdly remember some of their fights and the things I’ve heard them say and seen them do. As I’ve gotten older, I get preoccupied thinking back to those times and it bothers me more now that I can reflect back on it as an adult. I’m very hypervigilant and I’d say I’m in a state of fear or anticipating something bad about 75% of the time for no valid reason. I’ve been that way my entire life though, not just recently. I slept with my parents until I was 11 and I still have night terrors to this day, usually about myself being killed by a man. I just don’t understand how I was so fuctional as a teenager, but now as an adult I’m falling apart emotionally. I hate the way I am, it’s shameful and embarassing and the more I feel shameful, the harder it is for me to snap out of it.<|im_end|>

 Psychological problems are no more shameful and embarrassing than developing the flu or a toothache. You are not purposely causing your symptoms. You are doing your best to deal with your symptoms but you’re not a trained professional. Most people are not and thus can’t treat themselves.You were doing great until about four years ago. Try to think back about what may have happened to trigger these problems. If you think about it, there’s probably something that caused a change. Identifying the trigger might provide important insight about what might be wrong.As you already may recognize, untreated anxiety tends to become worse over time. That’s because people with anxiety disorders tend to inadvertently reinforce their anxiety. It’s called negative reinforcement. In your case, each time you avoid something because of your anxiety, you are inadvertently reinforcing your anxiety. This will cause the anxiety to increase in the future. Avoidance only makes the problem worse.Highly effective treatments exist for the problems with which you are suffering. You should not hesitate to seek help. Mental health professionals are specifically trained to deal with anxiety and depression. Counseling and medication have both been shown to improve the symptoms of anxiety and depression.Finally, do your best to refrain from self-criticism. I highly doubt that if you had the flu or a toothache you would refer to yourself as yourself “irresponsible, spoiled or childish.” Mental health problems affect many people, including smart and successful people. Your continued self-criticism might make the process of seeking help more difficult for you. I hope that you make the wise decision to seek help because it is the correct way to deal with this problem. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Tonight my boyfriend of five years told me that he cheated on me (protected) last week while drunk at a party with a girl he dosn’t know. About two years ago he slept with another female during a brief break up and contracted and eventually gave me a STD, I broke up with him then. At the time he was about 18 and I about 16. About a year and a half ago I decided to give the relationship another chance in hopes that he had matured enough for this commitment. This past year and a half has been amazing, we handle all problems like adults and are able to compromise and he had ultimately gained my trust back. This recent infidelity has come as a complete shock to me. Our relationship seemed to be at its best and I was considering marriage as the next step. I am now completely devastated and I just don’t know what to do. He is BEYOND remorseful and has been begging for me to stay offering to do anything. Everyone I talk to claims “men cheat” and that what he did, while wrong and inexcusable, shouldn’t be ground for break up. I know more detail is needed for a complete response but to sum it up I have been with him (solely) since I was 14, now 18 and in college (& a little mature for my age)with our relationship/love being SO strong plans on moving together to our own place and marriage were in the making. I know how sorry he is and I am sure he really will do w.e. it takes to get me back, I just don’t know if I should. I am so hurt and I feel like it may be more hurt to leave that stay. I feel like I found something good and I wish he didn’t put me in this position. I am beginning to consider couples counseling? Please help!!!<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Couples counseling is a great idea. However great your relationship is, your boyfriend has twice acted in a way that pulls you two back from a permanent commitment. He needs to take a serious look at just why he has done that. You need to take it seriously too. It could well be that he isn’t as ready to take the next steps toward a life together that you are but isn’t able or willing to face it to himself or to you.It’s not incompatible for him to care for you a good deal and still not be ready. You two have been together through your teen years and have no experience with other people. There may be a part of him that wonders what he’s missing if he slips right into marriage.It’s wise to think about couples counseling. A skilled counselor will help the two of you bring any doubts or fears to the surface so you can deal with them directly instead of by creating a crisis. You will deepen your understanding of yourselves and each other and you will improve your communication.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I am very unhappy with my life and myself. I feel like I don’t know what a normal life is. I am not capable of running my life the way I need to lead a normal life in this society, or of running my life the way I want to. But I don’t know why it is like this which makes it impossible for me to change my situation. I don’t really know who I am. I don’t know what things I am good at. I don’t even know what I want. I feel like I missed some important experiences in life, you need to make. I am extremely overwhelmed with my everyday tasks and my responsibilities. I basically don’t do anything throughout the day anymore because I just don’t have life energy anymore. And it is also unhealthy because I don’t get any exercise. I am a student at a University, but currently I don’t get anything done anymore. I don’t know how to cope with my studies anymore. And doing nothing also leads to losing more and more skills. And I also don’t have any other skills. I spend all my life only with working for school. I didn’t have any activities in my leisure time, or any other responsibilities where I could have developed any other skills. I am disgusted by the way I look. Since I was a teenager, I started to have severe acne in my face. And now, my face is full of acne scars. I also developed a skin picking disorder, which makes me destroy my face even more. I hardly had any friends my whole life. I have been bullied since I was a child, my only friends left me without telling the reason. I have a lot of trouble with my family lately. I wouldn’t even say we’re a family anymore. It is like everyone hates each other. I can’t talk to my parents about my problems because they wouldn’t take it serious or don’t care. I often said I want to end my life in front of my parents. The only thing they answered was that if I did it all the other people would blame my parents for doing something wrong and so my parents would be seen as the bad ones even if they weren’t. I don’t want to kill myself but I deeply wish I could end my life and start all over again. (From Germany)<|im_end|>

   I want to challenge what you are saying because there is a part of you that has done anything but give up. Look at your email. You took the time to think about it and craft it. This means that you have probably been reading the Ask the Therapist column for a while, and most likely looking at our other resources on the site, like the forums — all in the effort to feel better.The email you’ve sent didn’t fall from the sky. It reflects and ongoing struggle to feel better, get help, and be more productive. You start all over again with your next thought, not ending your life. Each thought brings us down a path that either leads toward hope or despair, and the first place to influence that choice is when the thought is happening. You did this very thing with your email. You made a conscious decision to write it and send it, which is the beginning process of hope. Why else would you have done this? From all that you have written it would have been easier to just shut down and not bother the write and send it — but you did.Keep following that impulse and let your next thoughts guide you to seek counseling at the university’s counseling center. You have done the right thing by reaching out here, and I’ll encourage you to continue this by reaching out to the university counsellors.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

My husband and I have been married for over a year now. While we were dating, I thought that he displayed traits of honor, loyalty, integrity, honesty, and kind-heartedness, as well as characteristics of a hard worker, and an overall well-rounded individual. Two months from now, I will have known him for five solid years (for all of which we were a couple).<|im_end|>

 When does a liar tell the truth? I’m so, so sorry that your husband has so disrespected you and it seems everyone else who has trusted him. He has gotten away with it too many times. From what you told me, I don’t see an indication that he is at all interested in changing. From his point of view, the only problem is that he keeps getting caught.I can’t tell you what to do on the basis of a letter. I can tell you that my opinion is that you should take a big step back and consder cutting your losses. At only age 23, you have a long life ahead. I think you’ve been betrayed enough.As for the relatives: You didn’t mind what your husband’s family thought about your marriage. Why be so concerned about what they’ll think about a divorce? If they have come to love you, I hope they will recognize that your only flaw is that you believed in your husband as much as various members of his family did. You, his dad, and his best friend are all in the same boat. As for your own family, it’s time to sit down with your parents and to explain all that has gone on. Admit that you were so caught up in the romanace that you didn’t pay attention to the red flags before you married. There’s no crime in having given the person you loved the benefit of the doubt. But at this point, there are just too many indications that he is a good con artist and that life with him is going to mean more of the same. Ask for their support and love in making the difficult decision to leave him. Ask them to help your grandparents also understand. The people who love you won’t want you to live in a situation where you can’t trust your husband.If a divorce is what you decide to do and it feels unbearable to live in town, there are at least two ways to deal. One is to hold your head high. You are not at fault for having been conned. You are the victim here. The other possibility is to go elsewhere for awhile and make a new life for yourself. In less than a year, you’ll be a college grad. You could consider grad school or you could look for a job in a new place. Why not use these next few years to go out into the world, to leave bad memories behind, and to grow in new ways?Whatever you decide to do, I hope you’ll give yourself time to grieve. This isn’t at all what you had in mind when you married. You are not only losing the man you thought you had, but you are losing the future you had planned. That’s huge. I hope you have good friends and family members who will understand that and who will be supportive.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hello. I have been friend with a guy since grade 6th. We were in the same grade and best pals of each other. Two years back I realized that I love him unconditionally and what all we shared was not merely friendship but I had other feelings for him. First I thought the feelings were mutual and so did all our common friends told me. But when I proposed the GUY, he refused me and said he never felt so. And everybody, including his brother and cousin who are my good friends too, have taken his feelings for me wrongly. He was just a friend to me always and had no such feelings for me. He certainly stopped talking to me. No contacts at all for 8 months. But I still loved him n I still do. I was always concerned about him. So kept a detail about him through his brother and friends but he fought with them too. At a point of time he broke all his ties with everyone and entered a new life.<|im_end|>

 I appreciate you asking this difficult question. It is hard to love someone who is addicted. Let’s see if we can sort some things through.In your desire to help your friend you see his potential. You can’t see what his abilities and capabilities are. But when someone is immersed in compulsive drug use, they don’t fully realize what is happening or what to do about it. You see it clearly and this is what causes the anguish.The struggle to find a balance between wanting to help and knowing you may not be able to has been experienced by many people before you.Because you live in another country I am not familiar with the availability of Al-Anon or Nar-Anon meetings. These are 12-step meetings for people involved as family or friends of people abusing or addicted to alcohol or drugs.If there are no meetings I would strongly recommend reading the book Codependent No More by Melody Beattie. This book specifically talks about how to untangle from this by detaching with love, and focusing on yourself.The best thing you can do for your friend is to know you are limited in helping him, but that you still care. This requires you to be strong enough to manage your life and continue to grow, while not letting his struggle with drugs become a drain in your life.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I have been married for 12 years to a 43year old woman, who has been diagnosed with bipolar. She was diagnosed in 2003 .Most of the symptoms were present throughout our married life together. She refuses to take her medication or receive any medical treatment, since her diagnoses. The last three years have been the greatest trouble for me. To be honest with you looking back on our relationship I would say the last 10 years have been a challenge. We have three children, two boys and one girl, ages 12, 10 and 5 and it has been hardest on them. In January 2006 I made the decision to leave the relationship. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done.<|im_end|>

I am sorry for your difficult and complicated situation. I am familiar with a very similar case of a woman with schizophrenia. She and her family have experienced the very same problems and it has been a difficult road for everyone involved. I am not sure exactly how the Canadian mental health system works but in the United States, it is extremely hard to get good quality treatment. I am sorry I cannot offer any specific recommendations for dealing with the Canadian system other than to keep trying to get her help.You mentioned above that your wife has a very hard time recognizing that she is ill and getting help for her problems. You must understand that this may not be her just deciding or choosing not to get help but instead that she lacks the insight to know she is ill. Approximately fifty percent of people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder do not take their medications because they do not believe they are ill. Approximately one hundred studies have been conducted on this “lack of insight” phenomenon and consistently report forty to fifty percent of individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder suffer with impaired awareness. The lack of awareness is a biologically based deficit known as agnosognosia. This deficit, or loss of ability to recognize one’s illness, is similar to what those with neurological disorders sometimes experience. There are occasions when people who have had a stroke do not believe their legs do not work despite much evidence to the contrary. Similarly, half of all individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder do not recognize they are ill. In these cases, they refuse treatment and will even generate alternative reasons to explain away their condition. According to research, people who lack insight into their illness are not simply denying it to give people a hard time; they truly do not know they are ill. Albeit extremely frustrating, their denial is not a deliberate act. Unfortunately, in America, and I am not sure if this is true in Canada, the mental health system leaves the decision to take medication or accept treatment up the patient, half of whom do not and cannot recognize they are ill.In the case I am familiar with, the husband also wanted to leave. He especially wanted to leave after spending years of having to involuntary commit his wife to hospitals against her will because of her refusal to take medication. He ultimately did not leave and decided to stick it out with his wife. In this case, after 20 years of her episodes, the family, including the children, now adults, finally banded together and took a hard stand with the mom/wife and demanded that she take her medication. After a few trial and error attempts to force her to take her medication, it finally worked. That was over a year ago and the mother/wife takes her medication every day and has not relapsed. This is quite a remarkable feat given she had relapsed and been hospitalized over 30 times over the years, all due to her refusal to take medication because she did not recognize she was ill. The family worked out a system where they take turns giving her medication; each person assigned a specific day.The doctors considered her a lost cause, so ill that really no one could help her. But after 20 hard years, the family’s efforts paid off and she is finally on her medication and relapse free. She still does not recognize she is ill, nor will she ever most likely, but she takes her medication that prevents relapses and for the family, that is all that matters.I tell you this story not to compel you to stay with your wife but just to show you that things can change. It took this family a long time to realize how to help the mother. Had the family been informed by the mental health system about what schizophrenia is and how, as a family, to best help her, it may not have taken this long. It was not until the family learned the best way to help their mother with schizophrenia, and that they were able to help her. The family in this case had three children as well and none developed any type of mental illness. If fact, two of them went on to have careers in mental health.You are in a tough situation. There are no easy answers. In America especially, it’s often the case that the families abandon their ill family member. In the case I spoke about above, had the family divided and had the husband left, its likely that the mother would be living in a state hospital or even more likely, be living in the streets or jail.Your wife is your children’s mother and will be forever connected to her children. My suggestion is before you truly consider divorce and dividing the family, read all you can and learn about bipolar disorder. Contact groups like National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) (www.nami.org). NAMI is an organization dedicated to helping the caregiver(s) of a mentally ill loved one. If you feel your children are/will be affected, take them to counseling. You can talk to them about their mother as well. NAMI has information about how to talk to your children about their mother. My advice is to learn all you can about your wife’s disorder and don’t give up on your wife until you have tried all that you can. Once you have tried all that you can, then perhaps revisit your divorce plans. That decision however, will ultimately be up to you. I wish you the best of luck and please, if you have any more questions, feel free to write again and I will try to help you the best that I can.<|im_end|>"

I’m a 13 year old girl and I’m a very violent, sadistic, unempathetic person. I’ve had very violent desires and urges ever since I can remember, and in recent years, it’s also become sexual. To put it simply, I want to kill people, I want to see them suffer, and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t get sexual gratification from doing so. When I was younger, and even a little bit now, I would try to hurt animals. I would throw things at them, try to run them over with a dirt bike, and would tear any bugs I found limb from limb, along with other things. I would even plot to murder my parents when I was around 8. I’m not saying I don’t do that now, but I fully intended on following through with my plans back then. I would pack a backpack, wait until my parents were asleep, and sneak knives into my room. I’ve never had much empathy, and the amount I do have has been gradually decreasing over the years. I have decent cognitive empathy, but I have no affective empathy, nor do I feel sympathy at all. In fact, for the longest time, I actually thought the words “I feel bad for you” was just an expression. I’ve never felt for another person, or at least, not for a very long time. I don’t care about other people, nor do I form emotional attachments with others. Thanks for any help.<|im_end|>

 Your violent desires and urges are very concerning. Desiring to hurt others is not normal. Most people don’t feel that way. It’s good that you recognize these feelings as being problematic. Solving a problem first requires acknowledgment. It is an important first step.It’s also worrisome that you have tried to hurt animals. Not only is it morally wrong, but it’s illegal. If caught, you could be charged with a serious crime. The federal government has recently increased the penalties for people convicted of hurting animals. The Federal Bureau of investigation (FBI) considers animal abuse a “crime against society.” It is often a precursor to serious criminal behavior. People who hurt animals might also hurt people.Some communities have created a registry of animal abusers. Much like sex offender registries, people convicted of hurting animals are placed on the registry and barred from owning animals. These registries are publicly accessible so that community members can keep their animals away from dangerous people.In order to protect yourself against future legal trouble, I would strongly advise that you consult a mental health professional. Ask your parents to help you find a therapist. A clinical evaluation will determine if something is wrong. Most importantly, the therapist will then create a treatment plan to address your problematic behavior.Finally, if you feel that you are a danger to yourself or to others, call the authorities. They can protect you from doing something that you would regret. Hurting people and animals could lead to your arrest and severe punishment. Treatment could help you immensely. It has the potential to positively alter your course in life. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 My boyfriend of just over a year, who is 33 years old, may have anger issues. I thought he had an issue even before he told me that his ex-girlfriend thought he had an anger issue and should see a therapist (which he did). The therapist told him his anger levels are normal. However, I disagree. He gets incredibly angry over the smallest thing, like a paper falling on the floor, or traffic congestion, or if he forgets where he put something, etc. One time he thought he forgot that he left a tool outside when we left his house, and he slammed on the brakes so hard that my forehead almost went through the front windsheld! He also punched the steering wheel in the car one time because he had the hiccups. I find that his actions in most cases are at a much higher degree of anger than the average person, but I would like to get a professional opinion. I would very much appreciate hearing your thoughts on this. Thank you! *Note: He’s never once directed his anger at me, only at inanimate objects.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It sounds to me like your boyfriend either has a very low tolerance for frustration or he lets frustration build up to the point that the slightest little thing makes it all spill out at once. He doesn’t have anger issues so much as insufficient coping skills. To his credit, he doesn’t take his frustration out on the people around him, only at objects. That means that he does have some control. People with genuine anger issues usually don’t. But he is controlling his feelings rather than dealing with them.A therapist only has what the client presents to work with. My guess is that the therapist was correct in assessing your boyfriend as not having issues with anger. What the therapist didn’t understand was how anxious your boyfriend gets when things don’t go his way.If your boyfriend will accept your help, you could go with him to a therapy appointment and explain what you see. Your boyfriend could use some help learning new and more effective ways to cope with mistakes, with unexpected disappointments, and with a buildup of pressures. Life without adequate coping skills is hard on the person and hard on the people around him. You both deserve better.I wish you both well. <|im_end|>"

It’s like someone else’s thoughts are in my head telling me to do bad things. I need some help but I don’t know what to do or who to turn to, but my mind is scaring me. Ever since I was little I’ve had bad thoughts and urges to do bad things, like harm other people. When my sister was born I often caught myself thinking of choking her and had dreams of such events. I also get these same thoughts with animals or pets. As I got older they seemed to disappear, or at least I learned to ignore them. But recently they have been excessively worse, ever since I was 15 when I sexually abused by a good friend of mine. Since then I’ve had thoughts (but they don’t feel like my thoughts) about hurting myself or others. The first major incident I had was with my friend, nothing happened to make me snap but out of nowhere I just wanted to hurt her, extremely bad. I took scissors and broke them so they were dagger like. I ended up chasing her around the house with the intent on hurting her, I was able to snap out of it before and harm was done, thankfully. Other incidents occur when I’m driving, many times I have gotten the thought/ idea to drive as fast as I can until I hit something, because I want to see what would happen and I felt as if everything would be okay once I did. I also get urges/thoughts at work to stick my head in the deep fryer (again to see what happens) or to throw one of our large knives across the restaurant.<|im_end|>

 It’s good that you have written and asked for help. It shows that you are open to treatment and want to change.You should be honest with your parents about how you feel. You think they won’t believe you but have you tried talking to them? Have you tried to discuss these issues with them? You might consider giving them this letter. It could help them to understand what you’re going through.When speaking to your parents, ask them to assist you in seeking mental health treatment. Medication might also be helpful. Your symptoms are treatable but not if you ignore them and do not seek help. The main concern is that you will lose control and harm someone or yourself. For those reasons, it’s important that you seek professional help.You said that you don’t trust therapists. I wonder why. Perhaps your lack of trust is based on fear or misinformation about therapists. The very essence of the profession is to assist people in improving the quality of their lives. There’s no reason to distrust therapists. They can and will help you. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

They’re around different times every year. It seems to be random, but every few months, a get delusional to the point of not leaving my house for about two weeks time. It goes away instantly, but not before wrecking my life/relationships/stability. I suffer from major depression and anxiety. I’ve been on all sorts of medications, but these delusional periods existed before any meds came into the picture. I also suffer from ptsd due to trauma as a kid.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Without more information, it’s difficult for me to determine what might be wrong. If I could interview you in person, I would want more details about your delusions. It’s possible that they are not delusions, but more information would be necessary to make that determination.Understandably, you’re concerned about having to go to the hospital but you’re making a mistake by withholding this information from your therapist. If your therapist was aware of your symptoms, he or she would probably refer you to a psychiatrist for a medication evaluation. Delusions can be effectively treated with medication.You believe that your delusions are random but have you tracked them? Perhaps they occur more frequently around the anniversary of a traumatic incident or when you have not slept, or so on. Try documenting your experiences. Maybe they are not so random after all.You said that your delusions come and go. In that case, why not talk to your therapist about them when you’re not actively experiencing them and thus not a danger to yourself? Under those circumstances, you would not have to worry about hospitalization. That might be an ideal time to reveal this information to your therapist.Your therapist is in the best position to help you but only if you’re willing to be completely honest about your concerns. Always, always reveal everything to your therapist. I hope that you will consider my advice. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I studied psychology myself and I know more than anyone that we tend to get into patterns of behaviors that cause conflict with others without even realizing it. What I would like to know is if I sound like I am in a bad pattern and how to overcome it?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
  As you’ve discovered, being friends and being business partners are two different things. You are correct that the two of you are in a destructive pattern. But it is a mutual dance. And it takes two to make a cycle. That’s why it is called a “cycle”.I don’t think the two of you can solve this on your own. If you could, you would have done so already. You need new eyes on the problem, preferably experienced “eyes”, who can help the two of you get out of a destructive pattern and into a productive pattern of relating.I therefore suggest you get a consultant to help you. No, this doesn’t have to cost money. Check out the website for SCORE: https://www.score.org/. SCORE provides free business advice through a network of volunteer business experts. You can get help by phone, online, or by arranging to meet with a mentor.The stakes are high. Most start-ups fail. When business partners don’t get along, the business inevitably suffers and often closes. I hope the two of you can get past whatever ego issues might get in the way and reach out for the help you need.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I first started searching about DID when I was 12, because the voices I kept hearing were giving me a headache. I scored 92 on the sanity test for Dissociation, and have taken several other tests that confirmed that I may have DID. I cannot remember most of my childhood, and certainly can’t remember ever being physically nor sexually abused. My personality seems to change depending on who I’m around, and I feel as though I’m not quite ‘there’ at times. I have a lot of memory gaps as well, and there are a lot of students at my school who claim who know me, yet I don’t remember ever speaking to them.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I would advise against self-diagnosis. Internet mental health tests are good at helping people know if they should seek professional help, but they should not be used as diagnostic tools. I would agree that your symptoms are concerning. I would recommend being evaluated by a mental health professional. That would be the best way to determine if you have a mental health disorder.You mentioned hearing voices that give you a headache, but you didn’t describe the nature of the voices you hear. We all hear an internal voice. This voice is familiar and recognizable. When a person hears voices that are not familiar or recognizable, he or she might be experiencing the symptoms of a mental health disorder. Voices that are demeaning might also be a sign of a mental health disorder.It’s common to not remember one’s childhood. In such cases, it does not necessary mean that trauma was sustained. I would need to know more about the nature of your memory, or lack thereof, to determine if you are describing a symptom of DID or any other disorder.I would encourage you to speak to your parents about your concerns. Some teenagers are reluctant to speak to their parents because of their fear that they won’t be taken seriously. It’s an understandable concern; however, your parents may not have the reaction that you might fear. If you can’t talk to your parents, consult your school guidance counselor or another faculty member whom you trust. They can help you access mental health treatment. Counseling could be a tremendous help to you. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From a teen in the U.S.: I’m not sure if it’s just my anxiety, but I’ve been feeling like I’m acting differently even though I don’t have proof I am. I have been feeling a little more anxious lately, but I’ve been able to handle it. I have been experiencing some depersonalisation, could be because I’ve been living in a basement and I rarely go outside anymore or even upstairs. I might be depressed, and really I want to know how to get over that. I just hope this isn’t something worse. I just really want to feel back to normal and take control of my life again. I really don’t want to lose control of myself. That has been a fear of mine since I first got sick with anxiety a few months ago.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The best way you can take control is to pick up the phone and make appointments with both your primary care doctor and a mental health counselor. When there is a change in someone like this, I always advise a visit to the medical doctor first to make sure that the symptoms are not a consequence of a medical issue.If you are physically okay, the next step is to continue to take control of your life by seeing a mental health counselor who can help you assess what is happening psychologically and give you recommendations for how to get out of the basement and back into life.No one can get you the help you need but you. I hope you will follow this advice immediately. The longer you wait, the chances are whatever is going on will only get more challenging. You deserve to reclaim your life and to enjoy your teen years.I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

I am 14 years old, I am female, and I have known I was different ever since I was about seven years old. When I was seven, these “voices” started talking in my head. I didn’t know any different, but what they were saying scared me. When I used to watch television and people would come on the show, the voice in my head would constantly say “I hope they die” or horrific things like, “I hope they get cancer”. I used to talk back saying “No. No I don’t. Go away, leave me alone”, and it upset me. I spent a whole year being scared and feeling terrible when the voices started talking about my mother. They still come back sometimes, and I always have to reply saying “No, i don’t” or “No, go away”. I used to have compulsions, such as tapping things that I already touched once a certain number of times (usually even numbers, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 etc), and before i was ‘allowed’ to sleep, I had to recite the alphabet (in my head) about 16+ times every night, as well as opening doors over and over again and lights. There are more compulsions but there are too many to list. These went on and off for about four years.<|im_end|>

 This is an incredibly well-written and articulate letter for someone who is only 14. I’m afraid I’m not going to be much help. As detailed as your letter is, I have too many unanswered questions. There are a number of both medical and psychological illnesses that share some or all of the same symptoms. I therefore can’t tell you what’s wrong. I can only tell you what you already know: What you are reporting is not typical or considered “normal.” The thoughts and compulsions take up a lot of time and interfere with your ability to function in regular life. I imagine it’s hard to make and keep friends, to do your school work or even to develop your interests.You didn’t mention whether you have shared any of this with your parents or your doctor. You need to. No one should have to go through days of fending off threatening voices. No one should be such a prisoner to her own compulsions that she can’t do life.Fortunately, there is medicine and therapy that can tone all this down. But in order to get treatment, you have to be willing to see a mental health provider and to be as honest in the initial interview as you have been in your letter. In fact, a good way to start is to simply share your letter with the counselor. You did a fabulous job summarizing the issues.Writing this letter was an important first step in getting the help you need and deserve. I hope you’ll follow up and make the next step. Ask your parents to help you find a counselor who specializes in teen issues.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hi there, I’m torn between accepting or rejecting a diagnosis of Bipolar II. A clinical psychologist diagnosed me with Bipolar II a week ago and now I am under a primary care physician to receive mood stabilizing medication this week. I don’t think I have bipolar disorder though. Can personality not sometimes resemble bipolar? I am sometimes hyperactive and able to take on a 100 projects, feel super smart and pretty and am at the top of my game. I need little sleep and in fact find sleep an annoying timewaster. Then I have times, probably more often, where I feel sorry for myself, feel ugly, stupid and can barely clean my flat or look after my pets. When I’m hyper, I harm no one, I don’t spend too much or gamble or drink or do anything that could be considered damaging. I just work really hard, accomplish a lot (I work fulltime as a project manager, am a freelance educational writer and am in the third year of a science degree for which I have had 18 distinctions so far). When I am down, I do feel very sad and think of killing myself every now and then, but I would never kill myself as I know logically this would be stupid and that I always feel better again. In my mind, I am just a highly functional individual who is able to achieve a lot, use my time to the max, sometimes feeling on the top of the world and sometimes not. I’m used to feeling like this and I have all sorts of coping mechanisms around it. I am completely alone, no family and few uninvolved friends, so my state of mood never affects anyone. I also have no support structure should it really be bipolar and should I need help. I don’t understand why I should go on mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. I’ve had no breaks with reality, just a few very minor private breakdowns where I have cried a lot. But I got over those and I was just overworked and under a lot of pressure and it didn’t affect anyone other than me. What do you do when you are torn between accepting a diagnosis and thinking it is total nonsense? I change my mind at least 20 times a day. I can’t imagine I will be able to be compliant with taking medication or accepting help. (age 38, from South Africa)<|im_end|>

 Based on what you have described here, I tend to agree with the diagnosis that the psychologist has given you. It does sound like you meet the criteria. Most people experience some ups and downs, and yes, some personalities can include some opposing traits and tendencies, but the swings that you mention here do hit some of the classic extremes that are included in Bipolar Disorder and/or Cyclothymic Disorder.However, just because you meet the criteria for a disorder does not mean that you need to be medicated for it (or even treated). If you feel that you truly have the coping skills already in place to manage your mood and energy changes, you don’t have to pursue further treatment. But the fact that you consulted with a psychologist in the first place and state that you don’t have a support structure to rely on, indicates that you could at least benefit from the help of a therapist.Most people with Bipolar love their highs and hate their lows, so you are not alone in this aspect. Deciding how much the mood changes impact your life and your ability to function, as well as affecting your “quality of life,” will help you with the decision to medicate. Mood stabilizers will not change your personality, they will level out the highs and lows so that you have more consistency in your state of being. But you have every right to seek a second opinion if you are still struggling with the decision whether or not to pursue further treatment. I hope this information helps.All the best,<|im_end|>"

I have been with my boyfriend since the very beginning of this year. It’s just the past few weeks/few months that we have been arguing at least once or twice a week. But the problem is, I am going to be completely honest with you as there is no point wasting your time. All of the arguments were started by him. The first one we had was due to someone outside our relationship accusing me of being something I am not. And he phoned me up as if he had all the facts to go against me and tried to manipulate me with his questions.. you know when someone tries to put words in your mouth. I was fuming at that point and I yelled the roof down and he backed down like a puppy, and we made up the same night.. ( I felt so weak by then to carry on.) Then the week afterwards I came back from holiday, and with work and social activities I am very busy. Yet I still spoke to him everyday via text and email. But when I phoned him he accused me of not being grateful of the gifts he bought me in the past and whilst on holiday, and also that I put him last due to not phoning him, and that I didn’t care. Again I couldn’t believe he said all this due to me not phoning him 3 days after getting back from holiday.. I told him I couldn’t continue this any longer or put up with what he says. He was groveling saying he only does it because he loves me so much.. I felt he understood.. I was clearly still mad on the phone, and he asked me to be happy and ” not awkward ” with him the next day. So I did. Then within a couple days afterward, I was on the phone to him for at least 2 hours, and I was talking to a friend of mine.. I was on cam. He asked me to move my ring to my wedding ring and to pretend I was married, and he was getting annoyed because the friend was complimenting me ( I didn’t encourage the friend, I hardly know the person to accuse him). Then all of a sudden my boyfriend asked me if I would show ”myself” on cam. I told him in the past I have done this, and it was a phase with an old boyfriend that I believed was a good idea at the time. ( Only teasing.. not any funny business with clothes off ). And he switched on me, saying how I clearly don’t love him ” as much ” as my ex. And how I don’t care about him clearly. So I couldn’t take it anymore and I hung up. I couldn’t believe the whole time he was saying he wanted to ” see my tan ” he just wanted to see my breasts!!.. Then he phoned for about an hour straight and I picked up, and he said it’s due to the love he has for me and he doesn’t understand why he acts the way he does. I was mad, he insulted me saying ” I don’t care what disgusting things you’ve done” and asked me why I told him what I did in the past. After, he asked me if I was still mad.. I said ” Yes just as any other person would be in my position, insulted by someone you love, and expect me to be happy and let it bounce off me? ” He said he understood but expected me to be happy with him when he texts the next morning! I was so tired at this point from lack of sleep, I just agreed and put on a straight face. But even reading what I have read to you now, I can imagine what I would think reading this. But I am calling out to people on this site if they could offer advice? any personal experience? anything I can say. I just know when I speak to him on the phone he is worming his way back in. I would never put up with this in the past, but I did genuinely fall head over heels for this man. And I have never felt what I have for any other person in the past, so there’s that voice asking me to not let go of something I’ve never had before, and may never get again.. any help is really appreciated.. I just feel as if I have two voices in my head, follow my head or hope with my heart.<|im_end|>

 This must be very disappointing. You fell for a guy in a big way and now there are all these problems! I don’t think you are getting anywhere trying to answer all his concerns and complaints. The larger issue is that you’re involved with a very insecure guy. My guess is that other women have left him because of this behavior.You can’t fix this. He has to fix himself. You haven’t given him any reason to be jealous and controlling. His personal insecurities are driving him crazy and driving you away. You could try to talk to him about it. If he’s willing to work on it – and really does – then he may be worth hanging around for. But if he keeps making it your problem, then the relationship probably won’t work out.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I was diagnosed with schizophrenia this year. Ever since I was diagnosed people have been acting as if I’m a violent person. I see violent things, but would never act on them, I’m not violent at all. I don’t have a history of violence, but I’ve been seeing things since I was 14. Oh I’ve had the occasional fight like anyone else, but not acted out in violence unprovoked or for no reason. I only fight when someone hurts me or my family members. I don’t understand why everyone seems to think I’m so violent when the last physical fight I got in was at least 5 years ago. My brother-in-law beat my sister and I did attack him, but he was beating her with a belt and welted her all up so I honestly feel it’s justified. I’ve been threatened to have child services called if I babysit for any of my sisters, I’ve had people telling me to stay away from them because they’re scared I’ll hurt them or their loved ones, I’ve even been told if I ever have a baby of my own (I’m infertile so that’s impossible anyways though) that cps would be called the day it was released from the hospital. Even my therapists try putting me in the hospital every single time I go off my meds (I take haloperidol and can’t currently because my gallbladder makes me throw up when I take any meds or eat anything) because “you’re a danger to yourself and others right now.” I only started taking the meds this year, 21 years after the problems started. If I wasn’t violent during those 21 years why do they think I’ll be violent now? It’s not bad enough I see demons and blood and horrible things that I wouldn’t wish on anyone, it’s not bad enough I hear screaming a lot of the time, no they have to make it so I can’t even tell them what’s going on without being put in the hospital or evaluated to be put in the hospital. I don’t get it, please can someone explain this to me?<|im_end|>

 To best answer your question I would need more information about the circumstances in which you were considered dangerous. Without that contextual information, I can only provide a general answer to your question.It’s possible that you are a victim of stereotypes or that your therapist is recognizing something that you are not. It’s not uncommon for laypersons to believe that people with schizophrenia are dangerous. Part of that is the result of media and misinformation in general. There are specific circumstances in which individuals with schizophrenia can be dangerous but generally speaking, they are more likely to be victims of violence than they are to be perpetrators of violence.Another possible explanation for why some people think that you have the potential to be violent could be because there may have been times when you were violent and didn’t realize it or even recollect it. Let me explain.Psychotic episodes are a symptom of schizophrenia. Psychotic episodes involve a break with reality. These episodes involve seeing, hearing or believing things that are not real. Some people who experience psychotic episodes don’t remember experiencing them. If you don’t remember having a psychotic episode, then you most certainly don’t remember your behavior during the episode.There are several possible theories about why someone might not remember having a psychotic episode. One is that psychosis causes brain damage which could affect memory. Another possibility is that because psychotic episodes tend to be frightening experiences, the memories associated with these experiences are repressed. Powerful psychoactive medications, or the use of drugs and or alcohol, can also impair one’s memory. There may be other reasons as well.Some studies have shown that videotaping oneself during a psychotic episode might provide insight into the nature of one’s illness. That might be something to explore, with the guidance of a mental health professional.Have you asked the people in your life why they think you have the potential to be violent? That might help you understand why people think the way they do about you.I hope that I have sufficiently answered your question. If you more inquiries, please don’t hesitate to write again.<|im_end|>"

I have been in a relationship with my best friend for five years. We are a great fit in all ways, but he frequently questions my integrity and his self-worth. A few years ago, I took a high paying job as a personal assistant. We were living in a bad neighborhood and I jumped at the opportunity to make more money- without questioning the logistics. It ended up being a personal assistant to a pimp, arranging dates, managing money, and sending out ads for the girls. We talked about what my job would entail, and he was not happy with it, but agreed that we needed the money and it wouldn’t be forever. A few months after I started, my boss forced me to do something not in my job description. In the situation, I feared for my life, so I obliged. I didn’t show up for my shift the next day, hoping it would all just go away and I could find a different job quickly. I started receiving threatening phone calls. My boss demanded all the money he had paid me back ($20,000). He had a copy of my ID and social from the hiring process. He made it very clear that my life was in his hands. I worked as a sex worker for a year and a half to pay him back in full. During that time, my boyfriend found out about it and understandably flipped out. Our marriage plans went out the window, I was forced out of our friend group, and was left to deal with the aftermath alone. That was two years ago, and we are in a much better place now. But for him, marriage still isn’t on the table and his friends haven’t welcomed me back. He says that he often blames himself for not figuring it out sooner, and blames me for not coming to him for help. I try to explain to him that I was scared to involve anyone else for fear of what would happen to them, but he just doesn’t understand why I didn’t go to the cops. I’m afraid this occurrence will always be a stain on my relationship resume with him, and that he will only see his pain of feeling betrayed and cheated on, when that was not my intention. Can we work towards forgiveness? Or am I wasting my time? (From the USA)<|im_end|>

There are several layers here, and I am very appreciative of your courage and resilience in discussing the issues. What is clear is that this isn’t a situation you alone got yourself into. Your boyfriend was very much part of the process and dynamics that got you into the dilemma in the first place. This wasn’t something you did on your own to benefit yourself.There are three important questions here that you need to answer for yourself. First, is marriage what you want? Are you looking for that in your life at this time or is this relationship good enough for now. In other words, does the relationship you have with your boyfriend meet enough of your needs for now. If marriage is no longer a big deal for you then this might be okay enough.Does your boyfriend’s unforgiveness knock him out of the running for a good long term partner? If you do want to get married does it feel as if your partner won’t be able to get over this? If marriage is what you want then let him know this in no uncertain terms. If he can’t forgive you and will hold resentment toward you then it is not worth going forward. He may feel that if he forgives you that he will lose his friends, or that he is settling rather than working through. But if he can’t get past this and you want to get married then you’ll have to let him know the relationship can’t go forward. In these terms, he can’t give you what you want and need.Finally, I’d encourage you both to read this book Forgive For Good, and find a workshop specifically focused on forgiveness. In addition, you may want to find a couple’s counselor who can help the two of you work together on this.There are two elements of forgiveness. There is forgiveness of the other and unforgiveness. The unforgiveness has little to do with the situation or another person. It has to do with the feelings you have that negatively ruminate about the situation. People can be unforgiving about someone who has passed on — or a situation that is long since dissolved but the bitterness remains.Perhaps is a good place to start because your unforgiveness of yourself and your boyfriends lack of concern for you during that time may be beneath the whole situation. One way to break this cycle of unforgiveness is with self-compassion. As it’s essence self-compassion is being able to treat yourself like a good friend would treat you. Nurturing yourself in this way can ease the discomfort of the past — while setting the stage for not only being more tolerant of yourself and your boyfriend. Obviously, this works best when both of you work at this level.Here is a brief video on self-compassion you may find interesting to help you connect with that part of yours or that needs nurturing.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I have a family friend, who I consider to be like an aunt. She is in her 60s and ran an art organization until her employees quit( after her negligence with bring profit and ect.). We are living with 3 other people, all in their 40s and up. When i moved in me and my ‘aunt’ were only planning on being here for a few months until we were able to save more money and get an apartment closer to where she wants to live/ where I’m transferring for college. The 3 other roommates dont clean, nor take care of their cat and almost starve and leave her waste out to stink. When I finally had enough I addressed it, and 2 of the roommates decided to move out because I was not going to compromise living with roaches or working all day and then being the only one who cleans the house. After talking among themselves they decided to stay, and thats when things went south. In response, I started working more hours and working out outside of that so that I could focus on our goal of moving out. My aunt was on board with me until the other roommates started to say mean things about me, which made me very uncomfortable because they are twice my age. One day i went to the store with ML(aunt) and I specifically asked her to not eat the food that i was buying separate (dietary issues), she agreed. The next day when I woke up for my 5am shift my lunch had been eaten! I had to hurry to work so I texted her and asked if she could please buy back what she ate. She sent angry text about me being selfish, ect. There have been many more situations like this, and it’s getting really hard to live in an environment where now everyone (all twice my age or more) pick apart even my phone conversations and yell about who they think i am. Im not sure how to respond, so I ignore it and stay focused however my stuff gets damaged, and i cant speak up without being turned into the “enemy”. Im not sure how to handle this situation, especially on a daily basis.<|im_end|>

If you want anything to change, then you can’t ignore your aunt’s problematic behavior. Ignoring it only increases the probability of it continuing. You may be ignoring it because you don’t have time to deal with it or you simply don’t want to be confrontational. Though it may be easier to ignore the problem behavior, doing so could encourage it. Eventually, it in order to properly rectify it, you’ll have to deal with it directly.To effectively correct this issue, you have two choices: 1) enforce the rules and risk her getting angry or 2) ask her to leave. If you go with the first choice, she may get very upset. She may call you names and so forth, but if you want the behavior to change, then it is important to stand your ground.The second choice may be much more difficult but it may be the best solution to this problem. Generally speaking, you should never tolerate abusive behavior. You shouldn’t nor should anyone else. Often, people engage in abusive behavior because they can. I’m not blaming you for what is happening because she sounds like a person willing to take advantage of other people, but whether or not you tolerate abusive behavior is within your control. Don’t let people take advantage of you and they won’t.Sometimes people become victims of abuse inadvertently because they don’t want to be confrontational or come across as difficult. They may worry about what other people think of them or about hurting someone else’s feelings but in doing so, they can leave themselves open to abuse. This may or may not be what is occurring in your situation.Let your aunt know where you stand. You can be direct without having to be confrontational. The word confrontational often conjures up an image of aggressively yelling at another person. It doesn’t have to be that way. You can simply state your position without being angry or yelling. Calmly tell her how you feel. If she’s unwilling to follow the rules, then you may have to separate.If you have access to a local community mental health center, you might consult a therapist about how to best remedy these interpersonal issues. Dealing with people isn’t easy. It would be helpful to have the guidance of a therapist who can assist you in resolving these issues with your aunt and others. Community mental health centers often have therapists who assist individuals even if they do not have funds or insurance to cover the cost of sessions. Contact your local agency to see what assistance may be available. Good luck with your efforts. Thank you for writing.<|im_end|>"

I met a woman online in Norway, we emailed for 4 months, our emails became intimate, she ended up flying to Florida to be with me for 17 days. On the 4th day, she told me she had no feelings for me, then a day later she said she wanted to be alone, I left her at her hotel and went home, an hour later she called and I went back to see her, she apologized and said it was her, she felt far from home, she did try to change her flight but couldn’t. The next day she said she thinks she’s falling in love with me. The next 13 days until she left for home, everything was great, she made me feel like she did fall in love with me. Sex was great, we were very intimate, she told me many things, made me feel she would return soon and be with me.<|im_end|>

 The distance, her instability, and the range of emotional responses suggest that what you saw in this person was her potential, not her reality. I wouldn’t invest too much with someone on the other side of the globe who doesn’t respond to your emotional needs. Chalk it up to a learning experience and move on.Often what makes a relationship attractive is the lack of availability of the other. We want what is unattainable. I don’t know if this is true in this case, but the variety of obstacles that are between you now makes it too difficult for you to keep trying.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

 I am 27, and my boyfriend is 24. We have been together for 3 years and lived together for 2 years. Two months ago my boyfriend texted another woman while at dinner with me and his mother. When we got home the woman he texted had gotten caught by her husband. He read everything and called my boyfriend’s phone late at night while we were asleep. My boyfriend then got up and was sitting on the couch in tears in the morning and confessed. He said he has texted her naked pictures and she has sent them to him. He sends her texts like I love you and want to take you away from your abusive husband. He also tells me that she threatened to kill herself several times and has 2 children.<|im_end|>

 He may not have had a physical relationship with her but he was cheating on you. Regardless of the other woman’s circumstances, he was directing emotional and mental energy to her that rightfully belongs in your relationship. We’re not talking about a momentary lapse here. We’re talking about three years of this nonsense. You even had to fight with him to change his phone number? That’s not a good sign.My guess is he was getting off on getting away with it. He had lots of time in the last three years to break it off. It took being caught and threatened to put an end to it.By the way, he’s just plain wrong when he says that “any other man will do the same.” Lots of men are loyal and faithful to their women. He apparently isn’t one of them.I can’t tell you what to do. I can only suggest that you be very careful. Until he genuinely wins back your trust, your relationship is on very shaky ground.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I’m 15 and am haunted by the question if I am wasting my life. I often question what the hell I am doing, but then I feel like physically hurting myself because I strongly wish I could disappear. My father is an alcoholic and has always been for what I can remember. My mother is a lying, irresponsible woman who abandoned her three children for other men and would come crawling back to my father once they had left her. My father has been emotionally and physically abusive to all three of his children and my mother. My parents do not know of certain traumatizing events that I experienced. My mother is currently living thirty minutes away from me and my family, with her ten month year old son and boyfriend. I see her about every three weeks and again and again only receive disappointment from her. When I was younger, my mother tried to overdose in front of me and she then and now takes medicine for her anxiety. At age 11, I began to cut myself and it is still something I struggle with today, and I am now nearly 16. I was diagnosed with Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder and though in the past two years have deeply contemplated killing myself, I am still here trying to be more than what ever my parents are. I write nearly everyday and work about three days a week to distract myself from the pathetic issues of my parents who try to blame their current suffering on their children. I have a deep, deep hatred for myself. I used to starve myself and still have a distorted vision of my body that haunts me everyday. My anxiety is slowly eating the only sanity I have left, and I do not feel as if I have the energy to fight back anymore. I feel as if I am fighting within myself. One part of me plays the victim, if that makes any sense, and only thinks about how this is all unfair and the other part of me questions my emotions and I tell myself I am only exaggerating. I feel as if I have a hole in my heart and such a lack of love and attention in my life and try to fill it with substances that I have experienced – alcohol, drugs, and I let married men at my work touch me and speak to me because I am taking anything to fill the vacant hole in my heart and soul. I am running out of options and nothing and no one is making me feel any better, and I hate myself for saying that because I know I am the only one able to fix my life, but then again, I feel so alone and need someone, something, anything.

 I’m sorry that life has been so difficult for you so far, and I know it sounds cliché, but please don’t give up hope — because your life is only beginning. You can’t help what you have been exposed to so far, but you will soon be an adult and fully in control of your own life. I’m assuming that you are in therapy or on medication since you mentioned being diagnosed with depression and anxiety. If for some reason you are not currently seeing a therapist, please do so. With all that you’ve been through, you need some help navigating the next few years. You also need to focus on healthy ways of coping. You’ve been hurt enough, why hurt yourself even more with the cutting, starving and substance use?I think it’s great that you are working but it is NOT ok to let adult men touch you at work. It might be time to find a new job and start fresh. Since life has been so negative, you also need to try hard to create the opposite and you do this by putting yourself in positive situations and by surrounding yourself with positive people. Some examples might be the local Alateen program or a sports league, or you could volunteer at an animal shelter, tutor elementary school children or find another agency of interest to you. It can be very healing to give to others in need. Many times, we get more than we give.Finally, it is not ok for either of your parents to abuse you emotionally, physically or sexually (or anyone else for that matter). If it happens again, or if you don’t feel safe, please talk to an adult who can help. You can speak with your therapist, a teacher or school counselor or you can call your local child protection agency directly.It really does get better than this. Please give yourself a chance to find out.All the best,<|im_end|>"

I’ve been in a semi-serious relationship for the past year and half with a guy I met on a personnel ad. My family does not like him and has wanted me to break it off. Mainly because of his financial situation, he does not have a great job, no money, no skills or experience (not that he’s not smart or tried), I support him financially when I can, but when we’re together none of that matters. I love him and he loves me and we’ve talked about our future together. But when I think about the responsibilities to come I get overstressed and think maybe my family is right. I’ll be the one suffering in the relationship. My boyfriend and I also argue a lot, mainly because of our financial problems. We’re both 30 and are ready to settle down and one of my biggest fears is that I’ve invested a lot of time, and money, in this relationship and am I ready to just throw it all away? Will I be able to find someone as sweet and wonderful as him, who makes me feel the way I feel when I’m with him, who accepts and loves me for who I am? I should also mention that this is my first relationship (if that matters). I’ve always been afraid to open up to people, but with him, I’m not afraid, and it comes easy, which is what made me fall for him in the first place. I keep thinking he’ll get a better job, things will change, but it hasn’t so far and I fear it’s going to get worse. I also get anxious and stressed when I think about how my parents and sister cannot accept him in our family. I am very close to my family and can’t imagine being with someone who they disapprove and cannot accept. This has been one of my biggest struggles and it’s been hurting our relationship. I’ve thought about ending it but can’t seem to go through with it. Should love trump all and just have faith in what we have, or should I reconsider and be rational with the finance and family situation as a factor? Please help!<|im_end|>

 You should listen to your heart and your brain! As much as we’d all like to believe that love is enough and can overcome anything, as a therapist who has witnessed many relationships fall apart, I can firmly say that love is not enough.Healthy long lasting relationships contain love and affection but also many other factors such as compatibility, good communication, trust, commitment, respect, shared hopes and dreams, and common values. If your boyfriend works hard and does his best to contribute, even if he has a lower paying job than you, it could still work if you have these other factors. However, if you feel that he is lazy or doesn’t seem motivated to improve his condition, then chances are you will eventually resent him.Our families cannot decide who we date or marry, but sometimes they do see things from an outside perspective that can be helpful. In the end, you are the one in the relationship and you have to trust your own instincts. If he brings enough to the table that you can imagine a happy future together then go for it, but if you have reservations and don’t have much dating experience to compare it to, it might really be worth taking some time to meet other guys and see how you feel when you are with them. Don’t rush yourself to make a decision and think about your future and what is most important to you. If there’s too much stacked against this particular relationship, have faith that you will find a better match.All the best,<|im_end|>"

My brother has been married 14 years and is considering divorce. He has been communicating with his wife about his feelings. She is a very jealous type of woman who has not allowed him to have female friends. He has two daughters ages 10 and 11 and recently the girls have been getting more involved questioning him about his female friendships. Recently he took both girls to a concert & his female friend came along. The youngest shared that she told her mom about the concert and mom said “She did not know” his friend would be there. The youngest then told her Dad that it is not right for him to be at a concert with his female friend and not her mom. Another time recently the oldest daughter called him to ask “Dad where are you and who are you with?” … I don’t know if this is normal behavior for young girls but I am concerned that they are adopting these behaviors from their Mom. She also shares certain things with the girls (since the marriage is having problems) like “I didn’t know your Dad’s female friend would be there” for example. Is this something we should be concerned about? I worry the girls are being brought into their parents’ marriage issues and in the process are being taught to interrogate their Dad and worry about boundaries with him and friends.

 You have a right to be concerned. Each element of this sounds like it is a burden for your nieces. I would strongly recommend that your brother seek individual counseling concerning his feelings about his marriage.

I discovered recently that my boyfriend of 1 and a half years had been talking to a girl online. I have since seen their conversations, and he told her he had a girlfriend, but made it seem like it wasn’t a big deal. They flirted and talked about a few sexual topics, and he implied that I was pretty much his roommate.<|im_end|>

A; The good news is that your boyfriend understands that he has “issues” and that he needs some help getting over them if he is to be a good partner for anyone. The hard decision for you to make is whether there is enough good in this relationship to be patient and see what comes of it. His therapy isn’t going to be a quick fix. It is going to take some time. If he talks to you about what he is learning and makes some observable changes, he may be serious. If you do stay in this, I suggest that you be included in the therapy sessions now and then. If he is part of a couple, his problems affect you as well as him.Then it’s a matter of forgiveness. Forgiving someone and trying again is a gift. Once he makes changes, there is nothing else he can do to reassure you or to further earn a second chance. You need to decide if you can genuinely do it. If not, it’s better to wish him well on his personal journey and let go. You don’t want to live your life always suspicious and distrustful of the man you are with. He can’t live his life always under a microscope. It’s not fair to either of you.But if he’s truly a fine person in every other way and you can forgive and move on, then it’s worth a try.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Copin it would be better if you can force yourself to sit through the anxiety g with depression and anxiety from being a possession: I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for most of my life. I was abused by my mother and stepfather from the age of 5 when my father died to the age of 12 when my stepfather sold me to his dealer. I finally escaped in 2001. I am seeing a psychiatrist who is giving me medication for depression, but I am having difficulty finding anyone who can help me with the issues I am having learning to cope with being a person instead of a possession. How do I find someone who can understand and help me?<|im_end|>

 I am very sorry that you have had to endure such difficult life experiences. I can imagine how challenging it has been for you. Thankfully you escaped that situation and are now on the road to rebuilding your life. I applaud your strength and courage.My recommendation is to consider therapy. Medication is only part of a comprehensive plan for treating depression and anxiety. For most psychological disorders, the most effective treatments typically encompass both medication and psychotherapy.It might take time to find a good therapist. Start by interviewing between five to 10 therapists. Interview them over the phone. Ask them many questions such as: Can they help you? How exactly would they help you? What would they suggest that you do? Would they be willing to see you and if so, how soon and how often? How long have they been in practice? Have they helped other individuals with similar problems? What were the outcomes of those situations?Choose several promising therapists and visit them in person. Continue this process until you find a therapist whom you feel comfortable with. This therapist will likely be your best choice.Another idea is to ask your psychiatrist or primary care physician for a referral. Your friends or family might also be able to provide a referral to a good therapist. Lastly, the find help tab at the top of this page can assist you in locating a therapist in your community.I hope this answer helps to guide you in the right direction.

My mom has been acting strange for a few years with her symptoms gradually getting worse every year. She kicked every family member out of her house and lives alone now. Whenever I’m around her I notice she will mumble or giggle to herself. She has theories that ALL television shows have secret messages about the afterlife and every single thing they say on TV has a hidden meaning. She now thinks we can communicate to her with our thoughts. She is 40 years old. She will call us by different names and sometimes will yell at us saying that we’re not who we say we are. She also frequently tells us that she’s a member of the FBI or that she’s secret agent and also that she doesn’t need a job because a rich family member is going to give her money. I was reading symptoms of schizophrenia and I noticed she matched a lot of them except for a few. She has great hygiene and she dresses well. She is also a bit narcissistic and admires herself in the mirror often. She will sometimes tell us she needs to see a psychiatrist but when we get someone who will see her she will refuse to go and will scream if we insist. Do these sound like Schizophrenic symptoms?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You have described symptoms of psychosis, which may be indicative of a psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia. The only way to know if she has schizophrenia or any mental health disorder would be for her to undergo a mental health evaluation. Without an in-person evaluation, it’s impossible to determine an individual’s diagnosis.Her symptoms are undoubtedly concerning. Try your best to convince her to seek mental health treatment. The ultimate goal is to convince her to voluntarily seek treatment. Otherwise, there may be little else that can be done. Forcing someone to seek treatment is very difficult and typically can only be done in emergency situations. In most cases, an individual cannot be forced into treatment unless they are a danger to themselves or to others. Short of that, an individual typically has a right to refuse treatment even if they are experiencing symptoms of psychosis.You said that she lives alone. You want to do your best to make sure she’s safe. Check on her or send someone else, whom she trusts, to check on her. You may want to contact your local community mental health center to determine if there are services available that can assist your mother or family.If you are worried about her immediate safety, call the authorities or your local mental health crisis team. They can go to her home and evaluate her mental health status. If she were to need hospitalization, that can be arranged by the mental health crisis team.If you have additional questions, please don’t hesitate to write again. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: When I was in middle school, my acquaintances would repeatedly slap me in the butt at the lunch table and that made me feel very uncomfortable. That happened regularly. They used to say “I love you” sarcastically. One of them said I would go to college at “Touch my penis state.” They used to make me try to push someone off the lunch table and then they blamed me for it to the authorities. One of them poked me in the back with a pencil in the middle of class. I remember a day when I was in gym 1 of the guys said “You got pretty eyes” sarcastically and another one poked me in the stomach. I was kicked in the back in the locker room stalls when I was changing. One day a guy slapped me in the butt and then said “get your butt away from me man!” and another guy was laughing when that happened. I got my lunchbox stolen the year after that. I still remember all the sequence of events that happened in middle school and I still feel all the negative emotions and all the emotional pain that I felt at that time. I still hold a grudge against the middle school. And the few times I went to the teachers about it, they thought I was lying and called me crazy. I am afraid that I might have post tramatic stress disorder right now because of that.<|im_end|>

 I’m so very sorry you were so mercilessly bullied. I’m furious that teachers didn’t take you seriously. You were right to ask for help. They were wrong and unprofessional in their response. It’s no wonder to me that you are concerned.BUT — this is a big “but” — not all kids who go through traumatic experiences like yours become traumatized. In fact, studies show that two thirds of people who go through difficult times come through okay. This is usually because of a combination of resiliency factors: They know they are loved by people who care for them. They have people to talk to and who try to help. They are born with a more flexible temperament. They figure out ways to hold onto their positive self-esteem despite the bullying.Not everyone is so lucky to have those resiliency factors going for them. These are the people who are traumatized by the trauma. They usually show a complex of the symptoms of PTSD that are outlined in detail in the DSM-5. Briefly, symptoms are in 4 categories:So the answer to your question is complicated. If you are one of the lucky ones who already had a lot of resiliency, you may have weathered the bullying, learned from the experience, and maybe even become stronger for it. If, however, you felt helpless to stop the bullying, there was no one to turn to, and you didn’t already have a fairly strong sense of self, you may have developed symptoms of PTSD.If you think you did, please don’t diagnose yourself. Talk to a mental health professional to establish whether you have the disorder and whether you need some treatment. If so, the good news is that there is solid evidence-based treatment for PTSD. The bullying of middle school doesn’t have to shadow your life forever.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 Normal has different meanings in different contexts. In the sciences, normal is a statistical reference meaning plus or minus one standard deviation from the mean. This number is about 68% of any total. Thus we can describe anything as being “normal.” We can have normal shoe sizes, we can have normal weights for men and women of a certain height, we can have normal IQs and normal and abnormal amounts of milk consumed for a person of a certain age. Describing normal in this way simply means that 68% of the population possesses this characteristic.There are other meanings of the word normal when used in the mental health field and by the general public. For instance, cultural norm violation. Doing something which is in opposition to the norms of one’s culture, could be considered and would be considered by some to be abnormal or not normal.Sexuality is like the dark web. It’s there and it’s accessible by virtually anyone, but it is not well understood or documented and generally not discussed. Sexual desire and behaviors are rarely discussed in conversations, even with close friends or relatives. Sexual topics are almost always heard in the context of humor.Sigmund Freud said that humans had only two drives or motivations. One was Thanatos, or the death drive, and the other was the sex drive — and the sex drive comprised almost the totality of human motivation. Many have disagreed with him, some on a logical or philosophical basis but by far the most, by the ever present desire to deny the presence of sexuality, by keeping its discussion and acknowledgment in total darkness.Generally speaking, you cannot control that which arouses you sexually. However, you can, in every instance, control your behavior. Your sexual behavior must not harm you or any other human being. That is why all non-consensual sexual contact between people is considered rape and could earn one life in prison, without the possibility of parole. It matters little that which you find to be of sexual interest as long as there is not the slightest possibility that you or anyone else will be harmed by your resultant behavior.Obviously, I could not possibly have answered all of your questions. Nothing short of a multi-volume set of three inch thick leather bound books could come close to explaining human sexual desire. Good luck.<|im_end|>"

 I wish there was a simple answer but people being what they are, there isn’t a step by step process for blending families that works for everyone. It may be that you are more ready to move on than your boyfriend so you are the one who is frustrated. It may also be that his relationship with his ex makes it more complicated for him.From your description, it seems to me that your boyfriend’s problem isn’t really with the 14 year old. Just because she scared off one woman doesn’t mean that she will be successful in doing so with you. You are a different person. Hopefully, the teen has grown up some.The problem of more concern is his relationship with his ex-wife. He seems to need more support in insisting that she keep to the divorce agreement regarding visitations and that she stay out of his personal life. You might be more successful in moving things forward if you addressed those issues directly. See if he can talk about what he needs from you in order to draw a clearer boundary around his personal life — including his involvement with you. He may not realize that the kids would do better if they had a predictable, stable schedule. Your relationship would do better too.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 The “why” question is not an easy one to answer. Maybe you were born with an inability to empathize. You didn’t mention this, but abuse and neglect are sometimes associated with a lack of empathy. There are many other possibilities, but I would need to know more about you to answer your question.Even if you knew why you behaved the way you do, it does not provide much guidance for change. What’s most important is your being aware of the problem and wanting to change and be a better person.My advice is that you seek professional help. Once the therapist collects information about your life history, he or she can provide insight into your “why” question and help you change.The life of a criminal is not a glamorous or pleasurable one. It’s likely to lead to your loss of freedom. Without help, you’ll probably also struggle to develop deep and meaningful relationships. A life of crime, abuse, manipulation and shallow relationships is the antithesis of a good life. It will lead to your suffering and the suffering of other people.We are all capable of good or evil, but it is a choice. If you are open to change, then there’s a great deal of hope for you.

I don’t have a family and there’s always a void there. It’s wrong to lay all that on him, but I feel crazy I cant help ALWAYS needing affection and being told I’m loved.

 You are probably right that being abandoned by your parents has left an emotional hole that is hard to fill. In addition, you’ve uprooted yourself and moved to a new place to be with your guy. You probably haven’t yet made other friends so you are more dependent on him. My guess is that scares you. Your experience of people who love you is that they leave. You may be scared that he will leave too so you cling. Ironically, clinging generally makes people want to go away — which is what you fear most.What you do with yourself is find a therapist. It’s unfair and destructive to turn your love relationship into therapy for your neediness. Therapy will help you resolve your grief and anger about being left by your parents. It can also help you truly understand that it wasn’t because you were unlovable that they left.I also encourage you to find your own group of friends so you can spread your needs for affirmation and contact around. Join an organization. There’s a political campaign happening right now. There’s a need for volunteers. If that’s not to your liking, volunteer to do some community service. Join a club where there are people who share your interests. Get a job and invite people you meet there and like to get together after work. Yes. I know that finding a way to belong in a new place is hard but it won’t get any easier if you stick to your boyfriend like a burr. And your boyfriend will rightfully feel concerned about you and annoyed that he can’t do enough.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I have very bad concentration and often get my thoughts mixed up, I sometimes also think people know what im thinking or that im being watched when im alone.. and sometimes i think of the weirdest thoughts that wouldnt make sense to someone else but to me its really convincing. I also see these weird outlinings or shadowish(see through) lines in the air which are very light.. are these hallucinations?

 It is difficult to know what may be wrong on the basis of a short letter. Your symptoms may be psychotic in nature but I would need to gather much more psychosocial information and many more details about your experiences to know with certainty.What also complicates your situation is that you have a history of using hallucinogenic drugs. Hallucinogenic drugs have been linked to psychotic disorders. There are many theories about the causes of schizophrenia, and drug use is among them. It is important to remember that no definitive cause of schizophrenia has yet been scientifically proven, though there exist many theories.It is theoretically possible that your drug use has triggered the symptoms that you have described or they are side effects of your drug use. On the other hand, is also possible that your symptoms are being produced by schizophrenia. I am not suggesting that the causes of your symptoms are limited to either schizophrenia or drug usage; there are many other possible causes. Each should be investigated.Your symptoms should not be minimized. My recommendation would be to be evaluated by a mental health clinician. Meeting with a clinician would be advantageous for several reasons. Chief among them would be to determine if your symptoms are indicative of psychosis and to then begin treatment as soon as possible (if deemed necessary).Finally, if you have not done so already, abstain from illicit drug use. To say that illicit drug use is dangerous would be an extreme understatement. In addition, it can lead to serious, irreversible changes in brain chemistry.<|im_end|>"

 Your symptoms indicate that something might be wrong. It’s possible that you are describing symptoms of psychosis, but only an in-person evaluation could determine a diagnosis.With certain mental health disorders, some people describe feeling one way at nighttime and a different way in the daytime. There are also some people who stay up all night and sleep all day. They essentially flip their sleep schedules. Those are possible signs of psychosis or depression.Studies about psychosis suggest that early intervention is one of the most important aspects of preventing more serious problems from developing. It could potentially delay or even prevent the development of full-blown psychosis and or psychosis related disorders. It’s imperative that you seek help as soon as possible. You can either contact your primary care physician and ask for referral to a mental health professional or go to an emergency room. It is wise to treat your symptoms early. The sooner you begin treatment the quicker you will improve. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 It is very true that the first step to getting better is admitting that there is a problem. As long as your wife blames others for the problems in her life, she cannot take control of the situation. If others are to blame, she cannot change them because she cannot control them. From your description, she has a substance abuse problem. In her suffering she is hurting those around her.She is misperceiving reality. You cannot trick a therapist into “siding with you.” She rejects your interpretation of the problem and she rejects the therapist’s interpretation because it differs from hers. Since she believes that she is right, she needs a rational explanation for why the therapist agrees with your assessment. She knows that the therapist is both well educated and intelligent. So why would the therapists with all of their training and intelligence agree with you? Because you have tricked them.There is often more to a story. I would need to hear your wife’s version of events. It makes it impossible to provide specific advice without it.I’m not sure what you meant by the expression “nearly out.” I interpret it to mean that you cannot or are not willing to tolerate much more of her behavior and are considering ending your marriage.Three things that you might want to consider before deciding on divorce are: 1) individual therapy, 2) an intervention or 3) a short separation.A therapist could gather many more details about your relationship and assist you in determining your next move. Ending the marriage could be particularly traumatic for both you and your family. It’s important to have a great deal of support when considering or pursuing such matters.Couples therapy may have been ineffective but perhaps she would be willing to enter treatment for her drinking. If she’s unwilling to go to rehab, then an intervention may be necessary. An intervention would involve confronting your wife, in the presence of concerned friends and family, describing how drinking has negatively affected your family and your marriage, and asking her to enter treatment. Should you choose to pursue an intervention, it would be advantageous to consult a family therapist or professional interventionist before attempting it on your own.Finally, you might try a temporary separation. Being apart might afford you the opportunity to gain a much-needed, fresh perspective about the relationship. Ending your marriage should be a “last resort” option, after you have tried everything within your power to keep the relationship together. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Hello, I need help. I have strong urges to torture people/animals and force them into a bloody death. Blood satisfies me, I find pleasure from leaving self-inflicted cuts on my skin. At first I thought I was just depressed but I don’t hurt myself for that reason, I hurt myself to see my blood. I like the way it looks and feels. But that’s not the only violent act I wish upon myself, I fantasize about being tortured, I want to die as a murder victim, I want my murderer to cut open my body, I want to see my insides. These strange fantasies scare me, I can’t stop myself from thinking this way. In my spare time I catch myself glaring at people, planning their gruesome murder and seeing how I’d get away with it. I physically want to kill someone but I mentally don’t. I’m not sure if this is making sense to you, because it doesn’t even make sense to me. The only thing stopping me from hurting others is getting my satisfaction from illegal videos online, on gruesome websites such as ‘bestgore.com’ and ‘liveleak’. On these websites, people upload either real-life murder videos that they have committed, or videos of gruesome things that they have seen. I am not disgusted by dead bodies, gore or blood. Instead, I wish to be in a situation involved with a lot of blood. I have two very close, childhood friends that know about this, but no one else knows. I’m afraid that one day I’ll be sent to a mental institution if I end up doing something horrible. Let’s backtrack a little. I grew up in an abusive family, i don’t want to get into that situation but it might have something to do with the way I’m feeling right now. Ever since I was a child I had always loved death and gore, I remember when I was young, I watched the movie ‘Titanic’. I was never interested in the romance, instead, I would skip ahead to the scene where the ship sank and the passengers froze to death. Whenever my parents weren’t home, or I was alone, I’d play that scene. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I really need your help.<|im_end|>

 You mentioned being attracted to the physical act of killing and seeing blood. Similarly, people who engage in self-injury are also attracted to the physical release they get from it. It temporarily allows them to shift away from their emotional pain but it is very short-lived. It seems that you are suffering and searching for alternative outlets for your pain. Had you not experienced an abusive childhood, it’s unlikely that you would be having these problems.The people who were supposed to care for you, to love and to protect you, were the ones who hurt you. That is a breach of the ultimate trust. Anyone in that situation would have felt powerless and helpless. Murder fantasies could be your way of compensating for those feelings. In murder fantasies, you have the ultimate power and control. Nobody can hurt you because you have all of the control. To murder someone is to take away their life force, to end their power and domination over you.Murder is an act of evil. You’re right to be concerned about this problem because should you carry out your fantasies, you would likely go to prison and perhaps be executed for your crime.It’s very encouraging that you recognize that something is wrong and that you want help. It significantly increases the probability of your overcoming this problem. You are an excellent candidate for counseling. Counseling will teach you how to express your strong feelings in healthy ways. Others have done it and you can do it too. If you believe that you might harm yourself or someone else, seek emergency assistance. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

All my life I’ve been the outcast and honestly I prefer it that way. But I quickly realised that I’m different. I don’t really feel much. I don’t feel guilty or sorry for people and I knew it wasn’t normal for a boy at the age of 7 to be obsessed with murder and crime and killers. I knew I had to adapt and not draw attention to myself. So I created what you could say an act, a fake person. A role I had to commit to in order to seem as though I conformed, that I fit in. However, as i got older, I began to become cold and bitter but had to hide it. I wouldn’t say I’m a psychopath or anything of the sorts. I do share some similar attributes, for example I’m good at manipulating people, I’m smarter than average and I suppose in some senses i am fairly narcissistic though it pains me to say. I also like to consider that the person I am around people is confident and charismatic. All of this I have become accustom to. It is day to day life for me now. But as I come close to completing school, I realise that I’m drawn to death. The idea of killing someone is about the only thing that interests me and even for me that is worrying. The last thing I want to do is act upon such urges and find myself in prison for the rest of my life. I know this isn’t normal behaviour for any normal, functioning person but this is a last resort I suppose to really see if there is anything I can do before its too late. (From England)<|im_end|>

  The fact that this bothers you is important. This irritation in your thinking is coming from a healthy place and I would honor that if I were in your shoes. This is often how true change begins. Several of the things you describe about the other aspects of your personality are being monitored by this worry. It takes great courage to be aware of that and admit it. Now it is time to take the next step and talk to a therapist about where these urges come from. I’d do this sooner rather than later.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From New Guinea: When I was born my parents were still in university. I have always been made aware of the sacrifices they had to make in order for me to have the basics. I am well aware of that but how much negativity can one take? My mom is and has been the only person paying for my tuition and every time I make a mistake, which I try very hard not to, such as tell a schoolmate of mine what happens at home she blows up. Then there are threats to stop funding my tuition if unless I agree not to repeat the mistake.<|im_end|>

 I’m sorry this is so stressful for you. One way to manage it is to try to see the situation sympathetically from your parents’ point of view. My guess is that you are not a burden. Your parents feel they missed opportunities that they want very much for you to have. They are so focused on making a better life possible for you that they have put extra pressure on you without meaning to.Understand that the “pressure” from your parents is really a cover for their fear that you will repeat their situation and deprive yourself of the experiences they so wish they had had. They love you so much that they want you to have what they did not. Sadly, their way of loving is making you anxious.I don’t think you will be able to get them to change. What you can change is how you receive their pressure. If you consider it as well-intended support gone wrong, maybe you won’t feel so bad.By the way: It’s not a bad idea at all to try for scholarships. If you can see the world by attending a university in another country, you will enrich your own life immeasurably. If you do get accepted, don’t present it to your parents as needing to get away from their awful pressure. Instead, tell them how grateful you are that they have made it possible for you to do something they didn’t.Meanwhile, do respect your parents’ boundaries about what is and is not appropriate to share with other people. It sounds to me like they are more private than you are. As long as you are accepting their support, it makes sense to accept some reasonable rules.As for the ADHD: ADHD can be managed. I have had many successful students at the university where I teach who have used it to their advantage. Go to the “Find Help” tab on our homepage. Click on “forums”. Join the forum for ADHD. People there support and encourage each other and give each other strategies for managing it.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I’ve always felt sort of off. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in kindergarten and was almost immediately medicated. Things were fine until 8th grade when a boy left me and I spiraled into depression and self harm. Then in freshman year a boyfriend sexually assaulted me by saying that if I loved him I would let him do things. That messed me up more. Now it’s senior year and I don’t want to get out of bed. I shut down at the slightest hint of hostility or annoyance that someone directs towards me. I have thought running through my head telling me that people don’t like me and that I am doing things wrong and am being judged for them. I am scared to say things for fear that people will be upset. I pick at my skin and hair until my face and/or cuticles bleed. I continuously feel bored and numb. I feel as though I can’t get excited or aroused by things anymore despite that never being an issue before. I feel like this feeling has been growing since I was 13 and now it’s finally peaking and I don’t know what it is or what to do and I feel as though I am losing my mind. I just want to know what is going on with me.<|im_end|>

 Why are you torturing yourself by constantly testing your boyfriend? He may have fantasies about women with a body type that is different from yours, but he has chosen you. He didn’t have to. He thinks you are sexy. He isn’t “making” you feel ugly. You are doing it to yourself by not taking him at his word that he loves you as you are.My guess is that he has discovered that your other assets are far more important than his fantasy of the ideal body. My best advice is to enjoy your relationship with a man you describe as loving and sweet and stop comparing yourself to his fantasy image. Go back to accepting your own body and celebrate it for carrying around a heart and personality and mind that is attractive to your boyfriend.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I was diagnosed with schizoaffective at 15. I am 21 now. Though I had psychotic features diagnosed before that age. Im trying to figure out my past for my diagnosis.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It is possible that you inherited “schizophrenia tendencies” from your parents but I can’t answer that question with absolute certainty. What causes schizophrenia has yet to be determined. The prevailing theory is that schizophrenia is a brain disease. It is also believed, by many scientists and researchers, that stress and environment can play a major role in the development of schizophrenia.Though the exact cause has not been pinpointed, it has been established that individuals who have relatives with schizophrenia have an increased risk for the development of the disorder. It is important to note that the increased risk is slight. Having a relative with the disease in no way guarantees that other family members will develop it. Again, the risk is slight and its development depends on many factors.It is also important to note that even if your parents were never diagnosed with a particular mental health disorder, they could still be mentally ill. In fact, many people have undiagnosed mental health disorders.What I find encouraging about your situation is your awareness of your symptoms and your willingness to seek treatment. Research shows that at least 50 percent of individuals with schizophrenia don’t know they have the illness and thus never seek treatment. It is that particular subgroup who typically has a worse prognosis. With treatment you can expect a good prognosis. Factors associated with a good prognosis include:Do not hesitate to write again if you have additional questions. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Hi, I’m a 15 year old. I was abused and sexually assaulted when I was only 12. I had struggles with an eating disorder, depression, and anxiety through my junior high years. I do go to therapy, but I think there’s something else wrong with me. I have overcome my eating disorder as well as my depression, suicidal thoughts, and my anxiety is much better, but something I thought was normal was just brought to my attention to my therapist. I hear voices. Nobody else hears them apparently. They’ve got names and I can tell which one’s talking. Pan and Jacen talk the most, but there’s Kiri and Winter and others. They are not me and they have distinct voices. Sometimes I feel like I’m being followed and this makes my heart race. Sometimes when I swing or walk on the sidewalk I feel like someone’s going to shoot me or fire an arrow into my back. It’s dumb, but I can’t help it. Sometimes I see strange things that aren’t there. I used to see a dragon in the downstairs bathroom as a kid and sometimes my vision goes white or static is in front of all of it. My sense of time is also pretty bad and I usually don’t know what’s real. I listen to music a lot to ground myself and block out the voices. Pan is annoying, but Jacen is scary. He’s listening now and I can see him smiling and my heart is thudding. I’m scared to talk about this with my therapist because I’m scared of what she might tell me. Plus I think my parents are sick of me talking about my trauma and I don’t want to be a bother. Also, my mood shifts. Like sometimes I’m on top of the world and love everything and everyone and I’m ready to move out and be a doctor, but sometimes I want to die or I want to be ten years old and curl up in a ball and cry. I’m pretty high functioning, but I often feel unsafe walking down the crowded halls at school or at lunch. Sometimes I dissociate. I fade into my mind and I don’t remember anything except that when I’m brought back to reality, time has passed. I usually do this in crowded places. What should I do? Do I have schizophrenia or something else?<|im_end|>

 Unfortunately, I can’t provide a diagnosis over the Internet. I would strongly urge you to discuss your concerns with your therapist. You are fearful of discussing your symptoms in therapy but you shouldn’t be. It seems like your therapist has helped you a great deal already. You have overcome many other problems. There’s no reason to think that she can’t help you overcome this problem too.If your therapist knew about the voices and other experiences, she could help. You mentioned that music helps you to stay grounded in reality, but it does not work every time. Your therapist can help you develop new techniques.You should be less concerned about a diagnosis and more concerned about ensuring that your symptoms are treated. Nothing matters more than treatment. The sooner you treat your symptoms, the more relief you will feel.I’m impressed with your efforts and progress thus far. Have faith that your therapist can help you with this problem too. But first, you have to give her a chance to help and that begins by opening up a little more and trusting her with the truth. Good luck.<|im_end|>"

From Sarajevo: I believe i might have some problems, but before seeing a doctor i feel its easier to get some advice here. So, this has been going for a longer time, i can’t really say it is since childhood.

 I think you have two inter-related problems. If I’m right, the good news is that they can be fixed. Before I even got to the line in your letter where you speculated about ADHD, I was already thinking that ADHD might be an issue. Spacing out or feeling sleepy when overwhelmed is a common behavior in kids with learning disabilities. I don’t know if the problem is ADHD or something else. I do know that the first thing I would do if you came to see me would be to refer you for testing to see if a learning disability is at the root of your problems in school.Secondly: You yourself said that your sleep cycle is very erratic. This is not good. Sleep deprivation results in problems with memory and concentration — issues you also talk about in your letter. I urge you to request a sleep study to see why you are having such difficulty getting to sleep.If part of the problem is that you are staying up to play video games, then you need to change your playing time. Screen time stimulates the brain and makes it hard to fall asleep. Turn off all screens (phone, computer, tablet, whatever) at least an hour before bedtime (say 9:00 p.m.) and do something more restful like taking a warm bath or listening to calming music. There are lots of sites on the Internet that will give you more tips on how to readjust your sleep cycles.If you are not successful on your own, please see a sleep specialist to get further support to normalize your sleep. Your health — and your schooling — depend on it.I’m very glad you wrote to us now while you are a teen instead of waiting a few more years. Treating these difficulties now will position you to be a more successful adult.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 Hello Daniel. I am sorry you are experiencing so much distress. You should know that you are not alone in your struggles. There are others who also feel they were born the wrong gender. Some experience this so strongly that they undergo major surgery to change their assigned sex. Transgender is the generic term used to describe individuals who do not feel comfortable with their assigned sex. Transexual is the general term used to describe individuals who have undergone gender reassignment surgery. The surgery allows them to become the gender they believe they were meant to be but is it a major life decision. Middle Sexes is an informative HBO documentary that describes the issues faced by members of the transgender and transsexual community. I show it in my social work classes to help students deepen their knowledge about the complexities of gender. You may be able to view the documentary in segments on YouTube.At this point in time you need resources and support. This would include reading educational material and receiving counseling from mental health professionals who are trained to deal with gender–related issues. Specialists are often referred to as “gender therapists.” Many communities have transgender resources. I would suggest doing a Google search for “transgender resources” and the name of your community. You may also want to view the following Internet resources which may help you locate assistance in your community.Susan’s Place Transgender ResourcesLaura’s PlaygroundGLAD Transgender ResourcesThe last link may be particular useful because it lists some of the biggest transgender resources throughout the states. It is important that you receive support. Without it you may continue to struggle. I hope you’re able to access the help and support that you need. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Ever since middle school I’ve had these thoughts and feelings that everything I looked at didn’t seem real. It seemed fake. As if I was living in a game. As I got older to where I am now I feel as if I really am living in some other type of reality. The things I look at aren’t real. The people I’m around aren’t real. Nothing is real. Sometimes I feel like I I’m not even real. Lately I’ve also been having these thoughts and dreams about killing people. Just to see what’s real and not. I feel like I’m going to lose control of myself. And I can’t find myself to care. As if every day that goes by more and more nothing seems to matter since nothing is real.

 What you may be describing are experiences of depersonalization and derealization. Depersonalization is the experience of feeling detached from one’s emotional self. Derealization is the feeling of being detached from one’s surroundings. You may be experiencing some of both.It is estimated that half of all adults have experienced at least one episode of depersonalization and or derealization over the course of their lifetime. A disorder may be present if these experiences are persistent.The definitive cause of these symptoms are unknown. Individuals who experience these types of symptoms often have histories of trauma, including emotional, physical or sexual abuse or possibly having witnessed domestic violence growing up. Marijuana use is also thought to precipitate these symptoms.I would recommend that you undergo a mental health evaluation to determine if your symptoms meet criteria for a depersonalization and or derealization disorder. If a mental health condition is identified, the evaluator will then discuss your treatment options.It is especially important that you see a mental health professional because of your thoughts about killing people and your belief that you’re going to lose control. Those are important warning signs that should not be ignored. If you feel as though you can’t help yourself, then go to the emergency room, call 911 or ask someone you trust to assist you. Get help immediately. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I realize that around my age and older is when symptoms of schizophrenia begin to show. I am extremely concerned that I may have it. I hear voices and see things all the time. The voices in my head introduce themselves to me, and sometimes speak in different languages. I have a friend that has Schizophrenia and she said it is usually obvious, and that it looks as if I am showing early signs. I feel as if I can read other people’s minds. The voices in my head tell me things. Sometimes good, more often bad. It’s affecting my school work because they will shout things at me in Italian. I have done extensive research on schizophrenia, and I have many of the symptoms. Such as delusions and disorganized speech. So far I’ve counted 29 voices in my head. Do I need to check in to a mental hospital? Or do I not even have Schizophrenia. Please help.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I do not believe that you have to “check in” to a psychiatric hospital at this point but you should have a psychiatric evaluation. You can do this several ways. One way is to go to the hospital and request a psychiatric evaluation. Generally, an individual would utilize this option if he or she is experiencing significant or severe distress or there is an emergency. Typically, an individual would be admitted to the hospital if the evaluators suspect that they are a danger to themselves or to others.Another way to have a psychiatric evaluation is to make an appointment with a psychiatrist. You would choose this option if there was no immediate psychiatric emergency. Your parents can call the local community mental health center and schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist. Your parents can also speak to your primary care physician who may be able to recommend a psychiatrist. Another option, if you have health insurance, is to call the telephone number on the back of your insurance card. The insurance company typically has a list of mental health professionals they recommend and who are “in network.”As I mentioned above, it is imperative that you are evaluated as soon as possible. Auditory hallucinations are not a common occurrence. It is a symptom that should be investigated very thoroughly. Hallucinations, both visual and auditory, are associated with schizophrenia but they can also be brought on by drug use, fever, organic brain disorders, dementia, and on rare occasions, parasitic infection.Please speak with your parents immediately about having a psychiatric evaluation. It is best not to assume that you have schizophrenia or any other condition. You will not know what, if any, disorder you have until you have been thoroughly screened by medical and mental health professionals. In the meantime, it is important to remain calm. To the best of your ability, try to engage in activities that are stress-free and that you find relaxing. If the voices are worse during certain times, for instance when you are alone, try to distract yourself either by watching television, listening to music or by being in the presence of others. Other stress reducing activities include physical exercise, deep breathing, meditation, and yoga. I am not suggesting that you engage in these activities as a way to treat a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia. I am simply recommending that you reduce your stress levels as much as possible because increased levels of stress might exacerbate your symptoms.The next step for you is to speak your parents and to be evaluated. I know it may be difficult but please try not to worry. Worrying increases stress and at this point, you want to focus on stress reduction. Effective treatments exist for virtually every mental health condition. Please do not hesitate to write again if you have any additional questions. I wish you the best of luck.<|im_end|>"

My wife has been seeing the same psychiatrist for over eight years. I now accompany her since she doesn’t know why she’s still going to him and doesn’t remember what he says in the session. She has many hallmarks of early stage Alzheimer’s (about 18 months now)  but has been on Celexa for many years for depression and sees him just to be monitored. She does not want to be tested for cognitive impairment or take drugs–doesn’t see purpose. Has trouble articulating/expressing herself and really hates being “interrogated” now. She obsesses whenever I tell her her appointment is coming up. Any advice on how to lessen her fear of being questioned and/or tested? I feel pretty stuck–her psychiatrist is being ethical to monitor her Celexa dosage, but I don’t know how to help her, and he has no advice so far. She knows she has memory problems and is not in denial–she just wants to avoid doing anything about it. She has short term memory limitations and can’t be persuaded to be tested. Discussions about it go nowhere–her fears/anxiety overshadow reasoning with her. Any advice or strategies on how to deal with this? Thanks. (From the USA)<|im_end|>

  It is difficult to be with a loved one who has lost their sensibilities to Alzheimer’s. She is lucky to have your warm and caring presence throughout the struggle.

From Bosnia and Herzegovina: Hello, two years ago i was diagnosed a depression with anxiety. I was prescribed 20mg Seroxat/1.5mg Xanax per day. I felt better after a week or two, and as the therapy continued I noticed further improvements in my mental state. I wasn’t concerned with irrelevant things anymore, became more focused, I started to enjoy sincerely. Some four months ago, after almost two years of therapy, I began to work and started to take less and less seroxate (still took xanax occasionaly), and at some point, I quit on seroxate completely on my own. After a couple of days of cold turkey, I felt excellent. I felt completely healed, so I decided to quit the therapy completely and continue to fight with everyday issues on my own, with will, work, and exercise. In the past few weeks, I began experiencing some of the symptoms from before the therapy. Quite mildly at the start, but in last days I feel more and more anxious, and I started to obsess myself with some things from the past, as well as some irrelevant things that I bother myself for no reason. My question is — are these the symptoms from SSRI withdrawal, or am I going to my previous state (I had some serious breakdowns before I began with the therapy). Overall, I know that therapy helped me a lot, I don’t have major breakdowns anymore, nor most of the major depression symptoms — but these things still bother me. Thank You in advance.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
A: From what you are describing here, my best guess would be that it is a return of your symptoms rather than SSRI Withdrawal Syndrome. It sounds like you went off the medication slowly rather than an abrupt withdrawal and the symptoms that are coming back took a few weeks to manifest, both of which lead me to think it’s most likely a return of Depression and Anxiety. Here’s an article to that gives a nice overview: https://psychcentral.com/lib/ssri-discontinuation-or-withdrawal-syndrome/0005734Either way, I think it is prudent to speak with your prescribing physician and/or your therapist to help you decide how to proceed. It may be that a return to therapy alone might be enough to ward off the return of your symptoms if you want to remain medication free. However, if you know the medication helped you lead a more productive and peaceful life, you now have evidence that it is worth staying on them, at least for a few more years. Although it is risky, sometimes the best way we find out that a certain treatment is working is to discontinue it and see what happens. Sounds like you did much better in treatment.All the best,<|im_end|>"

I have seen my therapist for several years and she has been extremely helpful. Despite the number of years we have worked together, I still find opening up with her and sharing certain feelings or thoughts extremely difficult. Part of this is due to the fact that I have a hard time identifying my feelings and describing them. My therapist on the other hand is so insightful and can nail my feelings down with her questioning. I am very thankful she is able to do this (and also amazed at her ability to find the right word to help describe how I feel).<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 The only way for therapy to really be effective is to be totally open and honest with your therapist, so you need to let her know about your sadness and what has been happening to you during your sessions the last few months. She is there to help you, it is her job, so you shouldn’t worry about the effect you have on her, because it is also her job to know how to take care of herself as a helping professional. She’s human so she might occasionally show emotional reactions to your stories, but I would suggest that this is just evidence that she is really “there” with you. It is not something that should cause shame or embarrassment.It sounds like you and your therapist have a good connection. Be honest with her about your concerns and refocus on your own healing rather than worrying about the effect you have on her. And finally, if you feel that you are too connected to your therapist to focus on your own healing, it’s probably time to find a new therapist.All the best,<|im_end|>"

After going through a lot of ups and downs I’ve finally decided to seek some advise online. I am a 27 years old married female. I got married in 2008. This was a love marriage. We’ve been together for almost 7 years now. However, by the time we got married I’d started getting hints that my partner was cheating on me. 3 months after my marriage I found a valid proof to justify my doubt. My husband was studying abroad and had married me and left me in India till when my Visa came back. Few days after he left I found out through his email account that he had been constantly chatting with another girl and passing on unacceptable messages. I told about the same to my in-laws and did not let my parents know about it to avoid creating issues. I that that my in-laws would set him right. Rather my FIL just said that MEN CAN SLIP SOMETIMES AND A LADY MUST FORGIVE HIM SINCE HE IS HER HUSBAND. At that time my mother in law forced him to swear on her not to get back to that girl again and then that became history. However, me being a newly married girl that too living without her husband and that too not very well responded by my FIL broke up so badly that the incidence became the worst nightmare of my life.<|im_end|>

What is clear from your letter is that you husband does not have enough respect for you, is controlling and inappropriately accusatory. It is also clear that you do not feel like an equal partner in this relationship and that he doesn’t seem interested in addressing your needs. By your own statement this isn’t exactly the marriage you would have wanted.The first thing is for you to become empowered. Money is emotional currency in a relationship and the fact that he takes yours and uses it only according to his discretion (which you don’t agree with) is symbolic of the whole relationship. First things first: Find a therapist to work with during this transition. (The find help tab at the top of the page will help you find someone in your country.) At the same time I would also get your own money going to your own account. Don’t wait to have him do it—that is part of what has to change. You must start taking care of your own needs and the first one now is financial. Have your work money go into a separate account. Yes, this will be difficult for you to do, and impossible for him to understand. But waiting for him to attend to your needs is no longer an option.I would then find a local women’s center and get a referral for a lawyer who can help you protect your rights as you move through this. You need to form a support team. Emotional, financial, and legal issues are on this agenda, and I would strongly encourage you to get your team ready.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I have been dating my boyfriend for 6 years. About a month ago I told him I wanted to move out. I have felt like for 6 years I have spent my time and energy devoted to him and not me. He is disabled so he doesnt work, so when I get home it’s like if I don’t give him all my attention he gets upset.He is an acholoic and addictied to pain pills so he is that much worse in the evenings. If I go out with friends or when I leave for my night classes he gets all sad and upset because he says he is so lonely. He tells me he gave up all his friends for me. (Not true, his friends are drug addict’s and it was me or them)So much of the time I feel obligated to stay home and be there so he wont be lonely. We have never really been alot alike. We are 8 years apart in age. He was 28 and I was 20 when we started dating. He is a momma’s boy my parents are divorced and live 2000 miles away. I have worked since I was 15 he has worked here and there till he got disabled. I graduated from highschool and I am in college now, he never graduated high school. I love people and traveling he has social anxiety. I use to think I could help him, I thought if I loved him enough I could help him be a more outgoing, people person who wanted to quit letting the world pass him by. But what has really happened is I have because more closed up to people, instead of me rubbing off on him he rubbed off on me. I reliezed no matter how much I loved him after 6 years he was not gonna change. Then after I told him I wanted out, he asked me not too and some of his habits did start to get better, he started giving me my space and really started trying to make things better. Ok, but here comes the problem, I still dont know if I want to stay, I don’t trust that it is going to get better, it has already gotten so bad how can it? But I cant bring myself to leave I dont know what Im afraid of. I never wanted to hurt him I know he is a real fraigle person but I cant stand putting myself aside any more. I have spent nearly all my twenties trying to make this work. I am sad all the time, when I take showers my hair falls out in clumps, I dont want to go anywhere or be around anybody. I just dont know what to do. I am too scared to leave and too heartbroken to stay. I feel like I am going crazy.<|im_end|>

 I can understand why you are feeling confused. You are dealing with a complicated set of issues. Ethically, I cannot make a choice for you (i.e., whether to end the relationship) but I can provide some guidance and an objective opinion.There are several understandable reasons why you may fear leaving this relationship. One, as you said, is that you don’t want to hurt him. You realize that ending the relationship will be very difficult for him. He will likely suffer. That guilt probably stops you from ending it.A second reason why you may not want to leave is the fear of being alone. There is an idiom that seems appropriate here: “Better the devil you know than the devil you don’t.” What this means, in the context of relationships, is that many people would rather stay in their current situation with the known unhappiness than enter into a new lifestyle with the unknown unhappiness that it may bring. Also, for some, the thought of being alone is frightening.Neither guilt nor having a fear of loneliness is a healthy reason to stay in a relationship.Two other complicating factors are that he is disabled and he is addicted to drugs. You might erroneously feel guilty for ending a relationship with a person who is so disadvantaged. If so, please don’t. He may have problems but he is capable of making the changes that you have asked of him. He is a partner in the relationship and there are problems with his behavior. As you have pointed out, he could make many positive changes that would greatly enhance the quality of his life and of the relationship but he chooses not to. You have given him ample opportunity to make the necessary changes but he has not done so.His drug addiction is another major issue in the relationship. It is impossible to have a healthy relationship with someone addicted to drugs. There may be happy moments throughout the course of the relationship but for all practical purposes, drug addiction ruins relationships. In addition, by not addressing his drug addiction you may inadvertently be supporting it.You seem to have made legitimate attempts to improve the relationship. But even in light of some positive changes on his part, you are still unhappy. My belief is that you know that it is over but fear and guilt are preventing you from ending the relationship. In my experience people who stay for these reasons often feel resentment toward their partner. It is not healthy for you nor is it fair to your partner.If you continue to struggle with how to handle this situation, consider consulting a therapist. A therapist could provide informed guidance and help to clarify your thinking. The find help tab at the top of this page can help you locate mental health resources in your community. Please consider writing back to let me know how you are doing. I wish you the best. Please take care.  <|im_end|>"

Well it all really started when I came out to my parents. I thought it would be okay even though I knew they didn’t agree with that lifestyle but I didn’t know just how much they thought it was wrong. Before I came out to them they were easy going and even though my mom yelled a lot we all seemed to get along well enough. I had a blog, was on lots of different social media sites and talked to all kinds of people. After I came out my parents immediately started having “talks” with me. They put me down, told me to not live that lifestyle and that I would never be happy. I listened even though I didn’t agree. Eventually after a few weeks of this my parents sat me down and told me they had been through all my social media, including the private ones, my friends accounts (which were also private but my mom majored in computers and was able to get into them) and eventually they found out through these sites that I liked my best friend and she liked me. To a lot of our close friends we were dating, me and this girl but I had kept it secret from my parents knowing they wouldn’t approve. Me and my girlfriend had only ever kissed twice at this point and hadn’t gone far at all but my parents completely freaked out. They made me delete all my social media, break up with my girlfriend and they took all my electronics, including a simple tablet I used for drawing. They told me which friends I could keep and deleted anyone else who they didn’t like (for any little reason) out of my contacts. I wasn’t allowed to talk to people for weeks and I wasn’t allowed to hang out with anyone almost at all. I’ve gone to them many times and told them they are being too controlling and I even broke down during one of our “talks” and told them I’ve been depressed and self harming a little but they haven’t seemed to care. All they’ve cared about is that I’m nowhere near that “alternative lifestyle.” Sorry this probably is a pretty dumb problem but it’s making me depressed and hate them. Any way I can get them to calm down?<|im_end|>

 I am sorry your parents are behaving so poorly with you. I am certain they are doing this out of their love for you, but it is misguided.The first step is for you to get some support. I’d talk to you school’s guidance counselor about what your options are. Schools may have groups, or the counselor might recommend a therapist. Getting the support you need for talking with them is very important. I’d do this before confronting your parents again.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I’m an extremely introverted person, and I have been for a very long time. It was different when I was younger, and I don’t know when or why that changed. I was as loud and obnoxious as any other child. I spoke my mind and made friends relatively easily. Now, at the age of 23, I find that I’m unable to express extreme emotions, and it’s hindered my ability to form meaningful relationships – platonic or otherwise – in both my personal and professional life. Although I have many different “friend” groups and a few friends that I would consider close, I’ve never felt that I really fit in with any group in particular, and I’ve never had a best friend who also considered me their best friend. I’m likeable – level-headed, polite, easy to get along with – but no one absolutely loves me or hates me. My longest relationship lasted 4 months, during which I spent more time trying to avoid them than anything else, and I’ve never been anywhere close to being in love. Most of my other romantic endeavors have been little more than casual hookups with little to no emotional connection.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It is your opinion that your lack of extreme emotion is preventing you from developing certain relationships but I’m not certain that your self-assessment is accurate. Generally speaking, extremes in emotion are a sign of psychological instability and possibly a mental illness. For instance, individuals with bipolar disorder experience intense periods of happiness and sadness. Those intense periods of sadness and depression are referred to as episodes. Treatments for bipolar disorder attempt to balance one’s emotional state.Psychologically healthy people have stable moods. We all experience periods of mood instability from time to time due to illness and sleep deprivation, among other reasons but those periods should be fleeting and short-lived. Extremes in emotion are draining and unsustainable. The fact that you lack these extremes in emotion is indicative of psychological stability and not necessarily a deficit or a problem.Consulting a mental health professional would be advantageous primarily because it would afford you the opportunity for an objective evaluation. It’s possible that you are correct, and there is a deficit in your emotional response, but each situation would have to be assessed and dissected. A clinician could analyze those situations and determine if your emotional reaction was appropriate or not and advise you accordingly. You may only need a few counseling sessions to determine if anything is wrong and to learn the appropriate skills for dealing with certain situations. Counseling could be very beneficial for you. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

The other day my family and I were out at a restaurant, and this child in the booth behind us kept screaming and yelling and wouldn’t stop. Around the third time he yelled I had an image flash in my head of me strangling and then cutting up the child. I felt an immense anger for some 5 seconds. Then after that, the thought faded and I was very emotionally detached for the rest of the dinner. I felt no emotion whatsoever and said nothing. I had no urges to do anything but sit and stare at the table. I don’t know why I had such a violent thought, or strange feeling after. I did not act on my thought (just to be clear). (From the USA)<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
  Thank you for being able to confront this violent thought by talking about it here. What is important is that you noticed all three components of the experience. You knew the child’s crying was the trigger, the violent image followed it, and a detachment followed. Being able to notice this process is a big part of learning to correct it.Talking about these thoughts with a professional is important. Letting your parents know that you are having trouble managing your anger, or letting your school counselor know how quickly you get angry and then shut down is the next step.Trying to manage this without help can be difficult. Many people have angry thoughts and feelings — and counseling is a very good way to figure out how to manage them.Reaching out to us was a very good first step. Letting others know is the next.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Hi, i’ve been having some trouble with an infatuation/obsession with a female musician. I just can’t seem to shake it! Recently i’ve become a fan of this Australian band and very quickly they became my favorite band. The lead singer is female and i’m a lesbian and i can’t stop having erotic/romantic fantasies about her. It’s to the point where i have over 260 pictures of her on my iphone and i keep giving her expensive gifts whenever i meet her. I can’t stop thinking about her, all day, all night, all i want to do is stare at her pictures and just think about her. Now the problem is, i want the infatuation to stop but i don’t want to cut her or her band out of my life completely. She’s so sweet and i’ve written her letters and i talk to her on twitter on occasion and she seems to really care. But these fantasies are driving me CRAZY and i just don’t know what to do!? I almost enjoy the obsession but i know it’s not healthy! I’m not suicidal or anything, just depressed to the maximum degree what should i do?!<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It is important to realize that this individual with whom you are obsessed is someone you do not know. Individuals act differently in public than they do in private. Everyone has a public persona and a private persona. The image of the female musician is a public persona. Her image has been carefully crafted by her publicist and manager. It is not real. You are obsessed with and in love with an individual who is, in essence, imaginary. It is immature to be in love with someone you do not know.Obsessions are always unhealthy. Being obsessed often means that an individual has become fixated on an individual or an object in an unhealthy way. Obsessions are usually accompanied by a great deal of distress. In this case, your obsession has led to depression and for that reason I would highly recommend counseling. It’s important for you to see reality clearly. Therapy could address your depression and assist you in becoming more realistic in your thinking. Don’t allow this obsession to continue. Realize that if it continues to lead to feelings of depression, then it requires professional help. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Thoughts won’t shut up, devouring soul, frightened to death. I NEED HELP! I REALLY NEED HELP, I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF ANYMORE! I can’t sleep. It goes on in cycles, longest insomnia has lasted is 7 days. People keep talking about me. They keep wanting to hurt me. They say cold, mean things and they JUDGE ME. I can’t pay attention. Words mix up, sometimes I don’t understand what people are saying, almost like they are speaking in a foreign language. A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE DON’T UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM SAYING!!!! He used to touch me. It freaks me out because I keep seeing and feeling the emotion I pushed away. My psychiatrist is going to re-test me. She’s worried I’m hearing things. STRANGE VISIONS. I see stars in the room and they are smiling at me. Once I saw everything tell me to die and I kept saying egg salad. I feel like crying because I DON’T KNOW WHO I AM. I DON’T KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

 I am sorry that you are experiencing so much difficulty. It is difficult to feel ungrounded and unsure.The most efficient way to deal with this problem is to continue to relay your symptoms to your psychiatrist. If you feel that your psychiatrist is not helpful, then consult other mental health professionals. If you are overwhelmed or feel that you might harm yourself or others, then it is important to go to a hospital immediately. A hospital stay may help you to stabilize.If this situation is not an emergency, then consider other treatment options such as psychotherapy. You mentioned that you have a psychiatrist but did not say whether or not you are involved in other types of psychological treatment. Individual counseling might be helpful. It could assist you in analyzing your thoughts and help you to become more grounded. Group therapy could also be helpful. With group therapy, you would have the advantage of interacting with a number of individuals who can provide support and guidance.I would also recommend inquiring about a sleep study. A sleep study might uncover the reason for your insomnia.It is not easy for me to determine “what’s wrong.” I only have a limited amount of information. Your lack of sleep is likely contributing to your psychiatric symptoms. Insufficient sleep can lead to irritability and moodiness. In extreme cases sleep deprivation can cause paranoia, delusions and hallucinations. You might greatly benefit from a sleep medication. Please discuss this possibility with your psychiatrist. Lunesta and Ambien are two popular medications. They might provide relief.I hope you’re able to get the help that you desire. Please take care. I wish you the best.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I have been married to my husband for 3 years. His family is out of the country and visit us for 3 to 4 weeks every year. He has a younger sister who is very attention seeking and comes and lives with us for a month every year. She never tries to get friendly with me and is very clingy to her brother – my husband.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I don’t have enough information to comment on whether your husband is “over-attached.” He may simply be “attached,” which is a good thing. A man who is loving and loyal to his family is usually a man who knows how to be loving and loyal to his wife. If his family was asking him to choose them over you, it would be another story. I don’t see that in your letter. Instead, I see a family that misses him and that tries to pack 12 months of contact into 1 month.You didn’t mention how old his sister is. If she is over 21 and inappropriately hugging, it might be advisable for your husband to start asserting some boundaries. That’s a “might.” Since I can’t witness what goes on, I can’t venture a definite. If she has a boyfriend or is dating, it’s probably not a problem but if her only affectionate contact with a male is your husband, it may not be helpful for him to go along with all of it.If you were seeing me as a couple, I’d be asking your husband what he can do to reassure you that he hasn’t “forgotten” you during his family visits. And I’d be advising you to make more effort to befriend the sister by taking her on some “girls’ only” lunches or shopping trips or events. You’ll learn more about her when she isn’t so focused on her brother. It would be helpful if your husband supported you by encouraging his sister to go with you.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

When I met my boyfriend, it was an instant attraction on the phone. He was a friend of a friend and came highly recommended. When I met him finally it was an instant attraction in person.

He misses dinner and a weekend we were supposed to have together and doesn’t return my phone calls.<|im_end|>

I am concerned about several issues in this relationship. First, you did not seem to have any indication that he was using drugs. Apparently, he must have been using a substantial quanity of drugs for a significant period of time. How do I know this? For two reasons: He is at the point of detoxing, and you typically do not detox after using just a little bit of cocaine and secondly, he has “pissed away everything [he] own [s] or [is] worth on cocaine.” While, I admittedly do not know the extent of his use, (nor do you it sounds like), or just how severe his drug problem really is, I can say that based on a few items from his letter, his drug problem is significant. This is especially evident when you add in the fact that his drug habits have caused him to blow his life savings on drugs.My second concern about this relationship is that you are willing to stay with him and stick it out and you are willing to do this without really knowing the facts about him. If you did not know he was using drugs, there may be other aspects of his life that you do not know about him. You did not know he was using cocaine and now you find out that he has been using and has managed to spend his life savings on cocaine, yet this does not seem to bother you. Why not? This should scare you. That is, why would this man be acceptable for you? You mentioned that you have only known this man for a short time. In that short period of time, he has blown you off, revealed that he has a significant drug problem and no money to his name. So in essence, he is a drug addict with zero money and a known liar and these facts all emerged in the short amount of time that you have known him. These are red flags that indicate that this guy might not be the best choice for you. It is likely that he was high many of the times you were together.I am not denying that he is not a nice guy. He probably has a lot of good qualities. You should not be willing to accept these men into your life. Why not seek a mate who is not using drugs or sending all his money to support a drug habit? There are plenty of men out there not using drugs. To paraphrase Maya Angelou, “people always show you early on who they are and if you don’t hear it it is because you are just not listening.” What this means for you is that he is showing you his true colors right now, early on. He may not always have a drug problem, people do recover but as you mentioned, the relapse rate for many substance abusers is extremely high. Do not assume he’ll go through detox and everything will just been fine. This is usually not the case.Only you can decide if you want to stay with him. Perhaps you should consider a narcotics anonymous meeting for the family or friends of those using drugs. Going to one of these meetings might help you decide whether or not you should stick it out with your boyfriend. The odds are, unfortunately, that he will relapse. He has lied to you, hid away a very series drug habit and lost of all his money. He is really not in a position to have a healthy relationship at this point in his life and frankly, I am not sure why you would consider this person to be a potential mate for you, especially since you barely know him. I hope I have helped elucidate some of these issues for you. Good luck.<|im_end|>"

 Absolutely do not accept this behavior. People who love each other don’t threaten, hit, do name-calling and refuse to take responsibility for their own behavior. Your boyfriend is showing the signs typical of a potential physical abuser- – engaging in a cycle of abuse, sweetness, abuse. He’s already hit you. Since he sees nothing wrong with it, chances are it will only get worse.Despite your observation of your mother’s behavior, all men are not like this. I imagine that you’ve accepted the mistreatment because you got used to the idea that this is “normal” from watching your parents’ interactions. It’s not normal. It’s not usual. It’s not okay.

My stepson is divorcing my daughter-in-law for another woman, whom he is marrying 5 days after his divorce is final. My daughter-in-law lives in SC and wants to move back to MI, so is moving in with us as she cannot financially afford to live on her own with all the debt they have and they haven’t sold their house. Our stepson had no problem with this in the beginning, and our granddaughters are coming to live with us also. Now, he has decided that he wants to come and visit us 5 days after we get her moved into our house. He told us to just kick her out. He wants us to meet his new wife.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 This kind of situation with conflicting loyalties and needs can tear a family apart. I’m glad you wrote to us.From where I sit, your stepson has multiple problems. He is marrying so quickly after a divorce that he isn’t giving himself time to learn from the experience of a failed marriage. He doesn’t seem to understand that whatever his feelings for his former wife, she is still the mother of his children, your grandchildren, and is deserving of some respect, if only for that. He seems to be asking you and your husband to take sides in a no-win contest of love and loyalties. He doesn’t seem to be considering how his kids will feel about meeting this woman who has taken their mother’s place in his life and his bed.Meanwhile, your husband is torn. He doesn’t want to lose his son over all this but he has made a commitment to the mother of his grandchildren and to you. He may have the idea that blood relationship comes first. But he isn’t considering that his grandchildren are also of his blood and deserve his consideration – even over his son. They are the most vulnerable people in this situation.For the kids’ sake, my opinion is that if your stepson wants to integrate his new wife into the family, he needs to take it much more slowly. It’s unfair to displace his children’s mother from her home. It would be hard on the kids to have to have his new wife, their new stepmother, move right into their mom’s place.One option would be for your stepson and his new wife to stay in a hotel or with a friend and to arrange daily visits with you and his children. If he really can’t afford a hotel room for a few nights, perhaps your husband could help him by financing part of it. This would not only solve the sleeping arrangements but would let your husband demonstrate to his son that he isn’t taking sides. Your daughter-in-law could cooperate by agreeing to go out while he visits with you and the kids. Alternatively, he could arrange to take the children out to some local attraction or event to give the kids a way to get to know their new stepmom without intruding on his former wife’s life.Although I can certainly understand the intense feelings that go with this situation, I hope you and your husband will take a step back and rethink your positions. To me, the focus shouldn’t be on who has the “right” to be in your home (stepson or daughter-in-law). The conversation should instead be about how to support your granddaughters and how to integrate this new reality into everyone’s lives. Your stepson will leave after a few days. You, your husband, your daughter-in-law and the grandchildren will be left to deal with the emotional consequences of his visit. You want to make sure that whatever happens leaves everyone able to comfortably live together.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My wife and I have been married for almost 2 years. In that time she has been diagnosed with multiple severe medical issues. I have been beside her and been forced to watch as she slides farther into depression. Multiple times I have tried to get her to set an appointment for counseling, even giving her a list of therapists so that she can choose her own. She has not done this and I cannot seem to get her interested in seeking help. She has had bouts of suicidal thoughts and eventually I have been able to bring her out of that. However she has not been able to beat the depression. It is taking its toll on both of us and I don’t know how to help any more. Short of seeking a court order to have her forced into treatment, what can I do? Forcing her into treatment will be the end of our marriage, but if it helps her, then that is the price I will pay. Please help me with some guidance if possible. Thank you.<|im_end|>

 You are obviously in a difficult predicament. The most difficult aspect of your situation is that you can’t force someone into treatment, except on rare occasions and then only when a person is imminently homicidal or suicidal. On those occasions, an involuntary commitment to a psychiatric hospital is possible. Hospitalization stay length varies but on average, it only lasts three to seven days. Upon discharge, the patient is provided with an aftercare plan that typically includes a recommendation for outpatient care. If a patient chooses not to follow the outpatient treatment plan, then short of them being suicidal or homicidal again, they likely cannot be forced into treatment. That is the harsh reality of the American mental health system.You’ve tried to convince your wife to seek treatment but she refuses. She would be eligible for involuntary commitment if she posed an imminent danger to herself or to others but if she does not, then there is little you can do to force her into treatment.It will be very difficult to help your wife if she is resistant to treatment. Our laws say you can’t force her to do something that she doesn’t want to do.Another way to approach this might be to suggest that she try family therapy or couples therapy instead of individual therapy. If she were not the sole focus of the therapy, then she might be willing to participate in treatment. It’s worth trying.Try your best to convince her to participate in treatment. If she continues to refuse your help, then realize that you have done all you can. This type of situation is not unique to you; it is virtually impossible to force someone into receiving mental health treatment if they don’t want to.Finally, you may want to try seeking support from organizations such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) or Treatment Before Tragedy. They might be able to provide you with social support and guidance during this difficult time. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I believe that I’ve got a mental illness, and that’s pretty obvious to me. The thing is that i also believe that i want to have one. Can this desire (to want to get worse, or to want to have a mental disorder) be considered as a mental disorder itself?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 The desire to be physically or mentally ill is a characteristic of factitious disorders. Please keep in mind that I cannot know with certainty if you have a factitious disorder. The only symptom you have described is your strong desire to have a mental illness. It is an unusual symptom but an accurate mental health diagnosis could only be made after a thorough mental health evaluation.In the category of factitious disorders are mental health conditions in which an individual pretends as though he or she has a physical or mental illness. Individuals with these disorders seem to have a strong desire to be seen as injured or ill. They deliberately create a set of symptoms for the purpose of gaining attention and sympathy from others. Individuals with factitious disorders might create symptoms that do not exist or lie about their experiences. They may also seek out diagnoses or insist that they have an illness. Some individuals with factitious disorders eagerly undergo risky or painful medical testing and procedures.I suspect that the real need you are attempting to fulfill is a desire for attention. Generally speaking, that is the primary reason why individuals pretend to have an illness. They want people to notice them. Individuals in society have sympathy for those with a physical or mental health condition (though less so for a mental health condition). Perhaps you think that if you had a mental illness, your family and friends would have to pay more attention to you. You may believe that having a mental illness would ensure that you are the focus of their world. It is, after all, difficult to ignore a “sick” person.I suspect that your desire to have a mental illness is a misguided attempt to gain attention and sympathy. It is human nature to need and to want attention but pretending to have a mental illness is not a healthy or appropriate way to gain attention.If you are willing, you should speak to your parents about seeing a therapist. A therapist can teach you alternative and healthier ways to meet your emotional needs, that do not involve lies and deception.

 Some of your symptoms could be characteristic of depression. For instance, you described having a poor memory, wanting to be alone, having a loss of interest in life, all of which are signs of possible depression.You also listed other symptoms which include difficulty expressing your feelings, disorganized thinking, difficulty with speech, and several others but you did not detail the way in which you are experiencing these symptoms. For instance, what do you mean by “difficulty with speech?” Are you making up new words? Are you nervous in front of new people? Did you struggle with a public speaking engagement? “Difficulty with speech” has many meanings but you didn’t describe what you meant by that expression.I would need much more information to know whether or not you have schizophrenia or any mental health disorder.To answer your question directly, yes, a psychiatric evaluation is warranted. Self-diagnosis can be inaccurate and is generally not recommended. It is always wise to be evaluated by a mental health professional to determine whether or not a psychiatric diagnosis is appropriate. Please consider writing back and letting me know how the evaluation goes. I think you will feel much better after meeting with a trained professional and receiving a more definitive answer. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I am in a close and very tender relationship with someone, who might be suffering from PPD. He has been reading the symptoms and the characteristics and feels they totally describe him. He is willing to get some help. He has a great mind, is quite mature emotionally and is open to discussing his problems of mistrust and his ungrounded suspicions. So he manages to have his paranoid thoughts under control most of the time, though I dont know with what cost.<|im_end|>

 Your boyfriend should be evaluated by both a therapist and a psychiatrist. The therapist might suggest therapy. The psychiatrist will most likely focus on medication. In most cases, both therapy and medication are integral parts of a comprehensive treatment approach to mental health problems. He should also have a medical evaluation to rule out a possible physiological problem.If he agrees to therapy, it would be advantageous for both of you to meet with the therapist. Therapists often request at least one session with a client’s significant other, especially when there are problems in the relationship. The therapist may request to see each of you individually. He or she may want to see you together; it depends on the therapist.If your boyfriend chooses not to seek treatment, then I would highly recommend that you see a therapist. A therapist could assist you in dealing with the anger you have toward your boyfriend. A therapist could also offer guidance about what your “limits” should be in the relationship. The therapist, based on a detailed description of his behavior, might also be able to determine if your boyfriend has a mental health disorder.His behavior is unusual, and it is damaging the relationship. He should seek help immediately. If he is unwilling to seek help and his behavior does not change, you will need to decide whether you should or should not stay in the relationship. The “find help” tab can assist you in locating mental health professionals in your community. I wish you the best of luck.<|im_end|>"

I just want help. I know you can’t diagnose me through the internet, but can you at least help me narrow it down? Here are some characteristics of mine.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 What an interesting person you are! Yes, you certainly are creative. You’re right. I can’t make a diagnosis on the Internet. What I can tell you, though, is that the first thing we’d be talking about if you were to see me is that 2/3 of your life on the Internet and your use of marijuana. The two may not be a mix that your brain can tolerate.You are not living in the world. You are checking out in ways that are not helping you one bit. You can’t learn to be in a relationship without being in one. You can’t have a better relationship with your folks by hiding in your room and not sharing things with them. Ditto with your friends. You can’t learn how to tolerate losing now and then without taking real risks with other people. And you can’t substitute online tests for an evaluation by a real live therapist.So — my best advice to you is this: Take a shower, turn off the computer for a week, stop smoking weed and hang out with some friends instead. Talk to your parents about seeing a counselor. See what happens. Just doing all that honestly for a week will give you more information about yourself than another online test.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From a 14 year old in Canada: Ever since I can remember I have had very detailed thoughts about sex, most of which involved me personally being harmed and/or shamed. I had dreams were I was violated while large groups of people stood around and watched. Dreams were I was tied up in a glass cage, naked and in public, while people gathered around. I’ve dreamt that I was tied down and tortured, being told that if I made the slightest noise they (the torturer, whose face was never seen) would start the methodical torture over again, until I could endure it without making noise. In these dreams the torture was very overtly sexual.<|im_end|>

  Unfortunately, memories are not like movies that can be called up on demand. Memories are very much influenced by what we have been told, what we think we know, and our feelings, as well as pieces of accurate memory.Hypnosis doesn’t help either because of the very same confusing assortment of input. In fact, hypnosis can yield false positives because people are often very convinced that anything that comes up in hypnosis must be true.Far more important than retrieving memories (which you may not be able to do) is to validate that something has happened to you that should not have happened. Three year olds do not know a thing about sex or torture unless they’ve been exposed to it in some way.I think your dreams are a way you are telling yourself that you have issues to deal with that won’t go away unless you get some help. Yes, you do need help. Please don’t expect yourself to deal with such difficult material on your own. You deserve the support, encouragement and guidance of an experienced therapist.Although it can be difficult to find help when money is scarce and transportation is unreliable, it’s not impossible. Talk to your school counselor about how to find low cost services for teens in your area. You don’t have to share the details of your problem to ask for help finding a therapist.Another source of support are forums and support groups that you can join right here on PsychCentral. Members are people who have abuse histories and who are doing their best to heal. You can learn a great deal from listening to their stories.While you look for a personal therapist, do make use of the Boys Town Hot Line. (1 800 448 3000). Yes, girls can use it too. There are counselors available 24/7 for teens like you who need someone to talk to. It’s free and confidential.

I’ve always had problems with self-esteem, my weight, just me as a person in general. I grew up with only my mother and the times i spent with my father didn’t go well. He was abusive and strict and where i am from, there are no laws against beating children so there was nothing i could do to help myself. My mother had no problem with the way my father treated me because to her “he must have done it for a good reason” and she is very strict too (i wasn’t allowed outside, no friends over, nothing but school work, etc).<|im_end|>

So to start from the beginning, I’m overweight and have a very bad relationship with my mother. My mother is honestly perfect in everyone’s eyes, where as I am her dull, uglier daughter. So even though she supports me most of the time when it comes to weight etc, she can’t stand me. She’ll constantly mutter how I’m disgusting to look at and that she can’t see me and all that. Then we have these huge fights, and even if I accidentally show her I’m crying or whatever she’ll ask me to stop being dramatic etc.<|im_end|>

 It doesn’t seem as though you have a mental health disorder per se. Generally, it seems as though you may have low self-esteem and lack self-confidence. Those are not mental disorders. These are traits that one develops over time, when you fail to do things that inspire confidence in yourself. In other words, life achievements, and doing things that you are proud of, will help you to attain healthy levels of self-esteem and confidence.Another potential problematic element in your life is your mother. You and she do not get along. She says cruel things to you. That could certainly affect how you see yourself. Your being upset with the way she treats you is a normal response. It would take a toll on most everyone.You also mentioned experiencing severe anxiety during a public speaking event. Public speaking is a very common fear. You wrote that you’re not normally anxious during public speaking events, but perhaps this one was particularly anxiety-producing. I would need more information to know if it’s a sign of a larger problem or if it was the event.You would be the perfect candidate for counseling. These are exactly the type of problems that are commonly dealt with in therapy. It might also be beneficial to limit your time with your mother. Unless she stops saying mean things, the less time spent with her, the better you might feel. With counseling, you might learn to better tolerate her negativity but for now, it might be beneficial to limit the time you spend with her.One final thing to remember: your mother might say, those things because of her own psychological problems and limitations. That is commonly the case with many people. They treat others poorly because of their own personal shortcomings. It is best not to take it personally but that is a challenge.Counseling will help you to develop a stronger sense of self-confidence, as will life accomplishments, maturity and healthy psychological growth. As you develop more confidence, you will care less about the opinion of others. The “find help” tab, at the top of this page, will assist you in finding a good therapist. Family therapy, in addition to individual therapy, might also be a good option. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Your opinion? My partner is contradictory and critical, but at the same time gets very upset if any of her ideas or decisions are questioned in any way. Examples: She will ridicule any book I am reading unless it is one recommended by her. If it is not a subject that interests her, especially technical books, she will describe the book as childish rubbish. The same with any TV program or film. She is an aspirational vegetarian. If I have meat and she has vegetarian she has spent the evening — while I am eating — asking how I could eat dead rotting flesh, how do I feel having caused the death of  a living being just for my gratification etc. The following week she will buy, cook and eat chicken and say how tasty it is. Sex. This has now ceased. Very often she has not only rejected me, but says that I am disgusting for wanting sex, “Don’t come near me. Don’t you dare touch me”etc — almost hysterical. A couple of days later she will start crying and ask why don’t I make love to her any more, don’t I care for her? She will deny that she ever said that she did not want me near her. I thought that being nice to her would gain her trust and we would get closer. But it seems to have the opposite reaction. The nicer I am, the more awkward, contradictory and demanding she becomes. She seems to need to push me until we have a disagreement. My partner’s mother was English and her father Portuguese and she was brought up in Portugal. Her parents broke up when she was 10 and she ended up with her mother who did not spend much time with her as she had to work hard. With her job her mother was given a scholarship for her daughter to go to the local international school. My partner spent years there but never got on as her first language was not English. She felt very left out, not coming from a rich family. My partner has two older brothers and mentions her poor relationship with them when she was a child. They continually told her she was stupid and ugly. If she wore a new dress they would tease her mercilessly. I think this has had a big impact. (age 65, from United Kingdom)<|im_end|>

 To be quite honest, I am not sure why you are still in this relationship.  You do not describe any positive aspects, only negative. It’s as if she is on a mission to make you feel crazy. It makes me wonder if she might have a personality disorder.I realize that you may have left the positive aspects out of your question, focusing in on the problems, but even if she has some wonderful qualities is it enough to make the relationship worthwhile for you? I don’t know her full history but there are many people who have been teased by their brothers and who have had some adversity in their childhoods who still grow up knowing how to show respect to others.If you choose to continue in the relationship I think it would be necessary to get some couples therapy and she might also benefit from individual therapy. However, given what you have described, I feel that you are justified in just breaking it off and finding someone who treats you with kindness and respect.All the best,<|im_end|>"

My best friend just contacted me at first to tell me she was dying her hair. Then she told me she was getting a divorce from her husband and was starting the transition to become a man. Her family is verbally refuting everything and otherwise ignoring what she has told them. She claims to be diagnosed with bipolar mania. However, she diagnosed herself. She has a Mensa level IQ and just completed her Masters degree. She claims to have more psychology courses completed and a better knowledge if psychological disorders than any doctor. She has only been to a doctor to prove her diagnoses right and to get anti- depressants and sleeping pills. She refuses to take anti-psychotics. She told me as if she was saying the weather, that she tried killing herself but her blood clotted to fast. She has also been cutting and she happens to be so good at it that usually it doesn’t leave scars. Only a few have become infected and they are not in any vital location. I am very afraid. I love her very much and I told her such. I do not know how to help her. Her family is ignoring her. She is going through an identity change. She is going through a divorce. She has yet to find a job in her field. I live 10 hrs away. With her instability and all these negative events I am afraid. I don’t want to lose her to her own mind.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Your concerns are valid. The recent changes in her life are likely contributing to her instability. Not being a mental health professional limits your ability to help her. Not being physically close to her also limits how you can help, but there are several things to try.First, contact her family about your concerns. She believes that her family is “verbally refuting” her but that might not be true. Her mental instability is likely impacting her judgment. Her family needs to know about her suicidal behavior. Given their proximity, they are in the best position to help her. They can call for emergency assistance, if necessary.Secondly, encourage her to seek professional help. Both a psychotherapist and a psychiatrist could assist her in treating her symptoms. The psychotherapist can provide counseling and the psychiatrist can prescribe medication.Finally, if she threatens suicide or even alludes to the possibility, suggest emergency assistance. She can go to the hospital or call 911. If she refuses, then call for emergency help or alert her family immediately. Threats of suicide need to be taken seriously and treated as an emergency.Remain supportive, keep alert, share your concerns with her family, encourage her to seek help and call emergency services if she threatens suicide. Those are five concrete ways to help your friend. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Hello! I don’t know what’s going on with me, but since a few months, I have been really enjoying looking at blood… I don’t know for sure when it started, but one evening I grabbed a pair of compasses and I stabbed the pointy end in my hand. I really enjoy looking at the way the blood pours out of the wound. I have done this several times in the past few months, but today was the worst one. I cut the skin on my arm open a few times with a scissor. I am afraid that one day myself wont be enough and that ill do it on somebody else… I have thought about cutting someone else’s skin, but I am too scared and I really don’t want to hurt anyone. I have also watched a YouTube video where a camel is being stabbed, and although I feel bad for the animal, I am fascinated by the amount of blood that’s coming out.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 There are two things going on. The primary events weren’t just the sight blood — it is the sight of your blood as the result of a self-inflicted wound. This is important as the episode with the camel followed the self-inflictions.The university in your hometown is one of the finest in the Netherlands, with a renowned medical facility. Use this nearby resource. I highly recommend you talk with your mom and dad about going there for an evaluation because you are hurting yourself in the process. There are various terms for being fascinated by the sight of blood, but these seem to be less related to your experience. The main thing is your self-harm.The fact that this bothers you and you do not want to hurt others is important. I am very glad you wrote us here at Psych Central and encourage you to be brave and take the next step of asking your parents for help in getting an evaluation. They may not understand the reasons why you do this, but they will want to help.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From a teen in the U.S.: Whenever I do something mildly wrong, get called an idiot, or just generally feel upset, I feel the need to have violent fantasies about being sexually, emotionally, or physically abused until I cry. The fantasies have been following the same narrative where someone severely abuses me and is justified because I did something horribly wrong to my abuser or their family member.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Thank you for writing. I’m sure this is hard to live with. I think you keep having the fantasies because at some point they worked for you. You are a sensitive young woman who has a strong moral compass.In 7th grade, you knew you had done something wrong and earned the reprimand. But, being you, you couldn’t let it go. You felt so bad about it that you went over it and over it. Crying may have relieved some of the intense feelings of shame and perhaps anger that went with thinking about what happened. If it had stopped there, it would have been an unfortunate reaction to a very usual piece of mischief that kids do.But being as concerned as you are with right and wrong, any time since then that you have felt accused or reprimanded, it has reminded you of that first time when you were not only wrong but humiliated for it. Your unconscious self then also remembered that crying gave you some relief.I suspect the “lesson” generalized and you started to cry any time you needed relief from stress. Stress just comes with being a teen so there was probably reason to look for some relief every day. But then you end up feeling bad that you feel bad. That must feel terrible!Unfortunately, your reaction has become a kind of bad habit. Having practiced it for years, feeling sick or crying is an automatic response to stress.You need some new ways to handle stress and shame. Maybe you can figure it out yourself but you would probably benefit from seeing a therapist who could give you some new tools and help you practice them. I hope you will consider seeing a licensed therapist to help you with this so you can go forward into adult life with less distressing ways for relieving anxieties and stress.I wish you well<|im_end|>"

I’ve been married for five years. In that time, my wife has had what I consider two text message emotional affairs with men. I know physical cheating has not happened and am pretty sure she’d not act out the texting fantasies. But the communication with the men is very sexually graphic. She’s also received sexually explicit pictures and videos from at least one of the men. I’ve tried to communicate with my wife explaining that I fear her “friendship” with the latest man has perhaps become too close. She absolutely denies that there is anything inappropriate being communicated and says that I’m being too insecure. She claims she considers the latest man as a girlfriend, since she has very few female friends she can relate to. My wife was sexually abused as a young teenager over a long period of time. Has that sexual abuse impacted her ability to recognize when boundaries with friends of the opposite sex are being crossed? Or, is my wife just a compulsive cheater that I have no hope in trying to work out our problems with? I deeply love her and don’t want give up on her, especially if this is due to her sexual abuse. But I can’t continue in the relationship if all I can look forward to is a new emotional affair every few years. At this time, I don’t think I would have any luck in trying to suggest counseling for us/her. I am planning on locating a therapist that specializes in childhood sexual abuse that I can see on a regular basis though, just so I can try to understand her behavior.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m a little confused how you know the explicitness of her communication with these men if she is denying that they are sexual and is considering them as “girlfriends.” Either you have been snooping or her denial is very, very high. Either way, you have a problem.I’m glad that you are looking for a therapist to help you understand the effects of her abuse and hope that this will eventually lead to some marital sessions as well. Sexual abuse can have dramatic effects and if it occurred over a long period of time like you describe, it can be worse. So yes, it could have affected her ability to understand and put up healthy boundaries with others. In addition to seeking therapy, I would suggest that you do some reading on loving someone who has been sexually abused. There are several good books written by therapists available.In the meantime, it is appropriate for you to communicate with her about your own boundaries and what you are and are not comfortable with regarding her relationship with others. We all need friends outside of our primary relationship but our spouse should clearly come first.All the best,<|im_end|>"

I’m 15 and all my life I’ve struggled with self-esteem. When I was younger I thought I was just humble and shrugged it off. It got to the point where compliments were almost foreign and insulting.

I even feel like I’m wasting your time while you’re reading this. I’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety disorder, and borderline personality disorder. I feel like my doctor just diagnosed me to get me out of his office.<|im_end|>

 No, you’re not needlessly exaggerating. You are hurting. Although it isn’t unusual for teens to go through periods of feeling low, you say this has been going on all your life. For that reason, I think you need to see a therapist for a while. I’m guessing the doctor who diagnosed you was a psychiatrist, not a counselor. Psychiatrists can prescribe medications but often don’t have the time to offer supportive therapy. When someone feels like you do, the treatment of choice is a combination of the two (medicine and counseling).You haven’t totally given up on yourself. You managed to write to us here at Psych Central. Please build on that inner strength and make an appointment to see a therapist. Take your letter with you as a way to get the therapist up to speed. Due to your diagnoses, I do suggest you see if there is a DBT (dialectical behavior therapist) in your area.While you wait to see a therapist, you can call the counselors at the Boys and Girls Town hotline, 800-448-3000, any time. They are available to talk to kids like you 24/7. It’s free and confidential.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Ever since i was young, I’ve had brutal homicidal fanaticise. All i think about is killing. It can be kids, adults, dogs, i don’t care. It’s a sick joy. I’ve hurt animals before and i would again. I don’t want power or control, i didn’t have a traumatising childhood and I’m a happy person. I get depressed and anxious when i think about it and don’t do anything for a long time I’ll lay in bed for days and just feel numb or anxious. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to tell my parents in order to get help. I collect knives so they’ll probably take them away. I don’t have any friends or anyone i can trust. No one knows i feel this way. I don’t feel angry, I’m not at all a serious person, i just laugh at horror movies or when im in pain. I can’t keep waiting in alley ways waiting for cats to kill i need something. It’s just getting worse. I’m 16 and want to wait til I have my own place until I do anything. Otherwise ill most likely be caught. I’ve thought out ways to get away with it for years. I can control myself now but I don’t think I will be able to for ever. What should I do?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You recognize that you have a problem but refuse to seek help for it. That would suggest that you are okay with killing animals to satiate your homicidal fantasies. Most people find the idea of killing abhorrent. They would not enjoy thinking about it and would never kill unless they were forced to, in a self-defense situation. You both think about it and do it. You have an emotional reaction to it (depression and anxiety) but it is not enough to stop you from doing it or to convince you to seek help for it.When you recognize that a problem exists, you should seek help. That is the responsible course of action. It’s especially important to seek help for a problem that puts lives in danger. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the top federal law enforcement agency in the United States, recently increased the legal penalties for people who hurt animals. They consider it a “crime against humanity.” They also recognize that people who kill animals might eventually kill people. Research has shown that killing animals is often a precursor to killing people.Regarding your parents, you don’t have to discuss or even mention your homicidal fantasies. You could say that you would like to meet with a counselor to discuss your depression and anxiety issues. That would be a perfectly reasonable request. Many teenagers struggle with depression and anxiety.You are in control of your impulses and urges, but as you correctly noted, there may come a time when you lose control. At that point, you might do something that leads to serious legal problems for you. For people whose conscience is not enough to stop them from killing, the societal solution is incarceration for life or death by execution. You are putting your own life at risk by refusing to seek treatment.As I see it, you are at a crossroads. One road involves your seeking mental health treatment which could positively alter your life course. The other road involves more violence and suffering. The only wise and moral choice is treatment. Any other choice would be a mistake, resulting in far-reaching, negative consequences for you. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Quick background…my husband’s sister is an alcoholic, who’s never been accountable for anything.  Recently her children were taken from her by social services and my in-laws are taking care of them.  We live within 2 miles of each other and I assisted in having my niece and nephew enrolled at my daughter’s daycare. My in-laws stop in the room my daughter (2 years old) is in everyday, twice a day while they are dropping off/picking up my niece and nephew (4 years old).  I think it is very disruptive for the classroom, and leaves my daughter to deal with me leaving her (which is sometimes upsetting to her) and then again when they leave her.  My husband will not ask them to stop visiting her everyday.  He said he is not telling them they can’t see her.  I think it’s excessive and unfair to our daughter.  I’m hurt my husband is ignoring my feelings on the issue.  Should I just tell them myself?  Should I push this issue with my husband?  Should I let it go?

  You did a good thing by trying to help out the children. Boundaries are something I would encourage you to talk with the daycare staff. Explain the circumstances and ask them to set boundaries on the visits. Many daycares have some guidelines for visitors to follow. You were helpful in getting the children placed there and talking to the director of the facility seems a very reasonable step in trying to resolve the situation. Your in-laws may be trying to compensate for their mother being absent and may not realize how disruptive they are being. My guess is this is a discussion the director can have with them.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I’ve had a partner for almost four years now, and over the course of those years he’s obviously begun to know me very well. He often jokes around with me that I’m “Bipolar” or have “mood problems”.

 One way to find out is to make an appointment with a mental health counselor for an evaluation. I don’t have enough information to make a diagnosis. What I can tell you is that what you report is not usual for an 18-year-old and could well indicate that you have a treatable problem.A rule of thumb for me is that when a behavior or feeling is having a negative impact on relationships or daily functioning, it’s time to stop worrying and to get a professional assessment instead. Worrying isn’t going to improve the situation. Talking with a counselor may well help you name the problem and figure out what to do about it.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 Thank you for taking the time to identify your situation. I think the next right thing would be to move from opinions to testing. For this you need a trained psychologist who can give you a battery of tests to help determine exactly what is going on. A very thorough evaluation can help pinpoint relative strengths and weaknesses — and can often take the guesswork out of the process. This can be helpful in determining what the next steps will be.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

 You’ve modified your lifestyle to accommodate her evolving needs. You’re supportive and loving. You’re even willing to attend treatment with her. You are clearly doing everything you can to help your fiancé. You’re doing what every loving partner should do when presented with such a situation but at this point she’s unwilling to accept help.You’re in a predicament. She didn’t cause herself to be depressed but it is up to her to decide that she wants help. You can’t force someone to do something they don’t want to do.You’re not left with many options but there is something else you can try. Give her an ultimatum: agree to participate in therapy for at least six months or you are not getting married. That may seem like a harsh tactic but your options are limited. It may be necessary to save the relationship and her well-being.If her ultimate decision is that she’s unwilling to seek help, you then have to decide whether you want to stay in this relationship. It would be difficult to maintain a relationship with someone who is emotionally unstable and who is unwilling to attempt to help themselves. It won’t be easy for you to stay and you may begin to resent her. Her unwillingness to seek help undoubtedly affects the relationship and your happiness.If you’re ensure about how to proceed, then consider consulting a therapist. I am suggesting that you see a therapist when it’s your fiancée who is depressed because it’s a delicate situation and a difficult dilemma, especially if your fiancée continues to refuse help. You’d feel much better if you had objective, sound clinical advice about how to navigate this most important relationship. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Lately when I sleep at night or randomly during the day, I seldom have dreams. When I do, they’re so fogged I can’t remember them. Most nights I see darkness that feels like it lasts only a few seconds, but when I glance at the clock, I have slept for hours. I did not have this problem when I was younger. It seems that the more I age the fewer dreams I have. Some dreams are nice, others are disturbing. I use to have daydreams all the time also; those are gradually disappearing too. Abnormally long periods of time pass before I drift to sleep. I am literally laying in bed for hours trying to sleep. I ask my mother what I should do but all she says is to turn on my side and go to sleep. What does this all mean? My friends say I’m fine and just need more sleep. I typically sleep about 4-8 hours during the week. I could really use some guidance on how to deal with this.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It is relatively normal to have difficulty recalling our dreams. One could go months without having remembered even a part of a dream. Though you don’t remember having dreamt that does not mean that you haven’t. I’m not certain that your inability to remember your dreams is indicative of a dream problem. It may potentially be a sign of sleep disturbance. You stated at the end of your letter that you typically only sleep about 4-8 hours during the week. I’m not certain if you meant 4-8 hours in an entire week or per night. My assumption is that you meant the latter. If you’re sleeping fewer than 10 hours a week, this would explain your inability to remember your dreams.If this continues to be a problem, then you should be evaluated by a physician. Report your sleep problems and inquire about the possibility of having a sleep study. A sleep study is a set of tests that a doctor uses to determine how well you sleep. The tests will measure things such as how long it takes you to go to sleep, and how long you stay asleep, among other aspects of your sleeping patterns.Sometimes, when people have trouble sleeping, it can be a sign of psychological problems. While that may be a possibility in this case, you didn’t mention experiencing any psychological symptoms.In the meantime, keep a journal about your potential sleep problems. It would be helpful to document the following information in your sleep journal: how long you sleep each night, how long it takes you to fall asleep, your anxiety level (no anxiety, low, medium or high), significant happenings of the day, and so forth. Keeping track of your sleep patterns could help to uncover a potential problem. Also, if you do eventually see your doctor about your sleep problem, your sleep journal would be a valuable resource in determining what might be wrong. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My mother has resented and (i believe) hated me since birth. She never hugged me or even touched me unless hitting me with a belt. She never said ” I love you” even once when growing up. 17 years later gave birth to my sister. She is treated with golden gloves. She has worshiped her since her birth. I can’t understand it. I was a wonderful, quiet, respectful child. I did anything and everything trying to get her to love me. I made straight A’s all 12 years of school. Teachers always thought I should have been promoted but my mother never allowed it. Now at 51, after years of therapy, I still can’t get past how they STILL treat her like a princess and never even think of me or my feelings. Right now my parents, sister, her hubby and children have taken a family vacation, which parents paid for, to Rome, Italy. Me, my kids or grand kids weren’t invited. So now we all feel hurt and don’t understand why. This is only one example . There are so many times in my life my mom has hurt me in similar fashion. I wasn’t allowed around my sister while she was growing up so I couldn’t influence her. They told her they didn’t want her to turn out like me so I never got to see her. I wasn’t promiscuous, didn’t do drugs, graduated with honors (they didn’t even go to my graduation). My sister sees this difference but doesn’t care. She makes comments at family get togethers how they love her more. Not that it’s not obvious to everyone already. I went to therapy for years. Therapist said the only way to get past was to confront them. It took me until I was 39 to do this. I told them how I have felt, gave examples, even begged for them to explain why. What did I do? My mother immediately tried to slap me and said I was lying. She has said many many times that I have been a liar my whole life. I do not lie. After her 4th attempt to slap me, my father came in. I explained again and he acknowledged that they did do this. He tried to get my mother to say it, but she would not. She stormed out of my home and as she left, told my 14year old she was sorry she had to live with such a crazy liar like me. My dad apologized and left. Now she tries to hide her hate for me but it shines through. She lies to me about what all they do for my sister and family so I won’t know she is still doing the same things. Such as the trip to Rome. They told me they were just going to her house to help her with the kids for a few weeks because she was so overwhelmed. My sister is married to a very successful man. Wants for nothing. He loves her dearly and she him also. She doesn’t WORK, but she is overwhelmed with two very behaved fantastic boys. She lives 75 miles from mom. I live less than 10 but they will not come to my home to help me at all. I am a single grandparent now raising my grand kids because my daughter has brain damage and she is bipolar. They all hate her as if she could change if she wanted. I was left out of their will as well as my kids. But somehow she still believes we are treated equal. They have never once taken me out for my birthday but take her very year. They go to her house and stay for weeks at a time but will not come to mine. Nothing changed after our discussion. Same things still happening and I can’t seem to let go even after years of therapy because it is still going on and because she wouldn’t acknowledge how she treated me at our pow wow. She has never once said she was sorry for anything she has done and still doing. How do I get past?<|im_end|>

 I am so sorry you have to go through all of this with your family. But you need to find comfort in knowing that you have tried everything, and your mother’s pathology is profound. Love, therapy, confrontation, and trying to enlist your father’s help has all been a valued effort at changing the dynamics, but the bottom line is that it is time for something very different.It is time to grieve.The family you hoped for never happened, the mother you needed and wanted was never a reality. I would encourage you to talk with the therapist about allowing yourself to grieve the loss of this potential. This is important. You did not lose something you had. You are losing the hope of something that never happened.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

My husband has been on Depakote for 10 years for bipolar disorder. He was diagnosed at 30, after a manic episode he experienced for two weeks after taking the drug ecstacy. (He took the drug June 24, went into hospital july 4). My husband was not a drug user up to this point, nor did he ever experience bouts of depression or mania before this time. After having the same initial doctor for 10 years, my husband is looking for a new doctor to help him come off of the medicine, as he believes he was misdiagnosed. I am petrified that the drug could have been the catalyst, and maybe he will have another episode. What are your thoughts? Would a doctor agree to take someone off medicine for this condition?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The story you have told is very common. An individual experiments with drugs and subsequently develops or suffers from psychiatric (usually psychotic) illness related symptoms. To know whether or not ecstasy was the catalyst for your husband’s manic episode is very difficult to know but it is highly likely that it did contribute in some way. Science still does not have a definitive answer on what causes bipolar disorder, or any other disorder for that matter. The mechanism by which psychiatric diseases develop has yet to be elucidated. Some theorists currently believe that some individuals, those who use drugs and subsequently develop psychosis, may have a predisposition to developing psychiatric disorders. Under this theory, drug use has the potential to serve as a catalyst for psychiatric symptoms. This may mean that if the drugs were never used, psychiatric symptoms may not have developed. It is my educated opinion that the drug did contribute to your husband’s manic episode but I could never know this for sure.According to Mind.org’s website: “Medication, drugs or alcohol can’t cause you to develop bipolar disorder, but they can cause you to experience some bipolar moods and symptoms. For example:”“Some antidepressants can cause mania or hypomania as a side effect when you are taking them or as a withdrawal effect when you are coming off them. If you begin to experience mania after taking or after coming off antidepressants for depression, this might lead your doctor to give you an incorrect diagnosis of bipolar disorder, or prescribe you more medication. But in this case it’s usually worth waiting to see if your symptoms pass without treatment first.”“Alcohol or street drugs can cause you to experience symptoms similar to both mania and depression. It can often be difficult to distinguish the effects of alcohol and drugs from your mental health symptoms.”Additionally, it is difficult to know whether the doctor would agree to take someone off of their medication. That depends entirely on what the doctor believes to be the correct diagnosis and which treatments or medications the doctor prefers. As far as getting an accurate diagnosis, this can be a challenge. Even through guidelines exist, such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), there can be so much variability between diagnosticians. I have read studies where 10 different doctors gave 10 different diagnoses for the same patient relaying the same set of symptoms. The key for your husband may not be getting the “correct” diagnosis as much as it is finding a doctor that he likes and trusts. I would advise him to search for a doctor who is willing to take the time to work through different medication and treatment trials. The ultimate goal for your husband is to find a treatment that he can tolerate and gains him respite from his manic symptoms—and to find a doctor willing to take the lead in this process.I hope this helps. Please write again if you have any more questions.<|im_end|>"

From a teen in the U.S.: Hi, sorry to be a bother, but I have been having some really disturbing dreams recently. As a little background I grew up in a normal, loving family, I attend exercise classes twice a week, and I journal regularly, so I feel like mentally I should be in a pretty good place. But I have these dreams where I do really disturbing things, I will describe a few of them here. In one I was having sex with the dead body of the girl I have a crush on (I am an in the closet lesbian- idk if that is important), in another I was having sex with a young child in a school bathroom. I do not have any, um, desire to be with corpses or children, but I wake up from these dreams feeling aroused. I would never, ever consider doing anything like that in real life, but is this something I should be concerned about?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 First: You are not a bother and your question isn’t dumb. Your concerns are as legitimate as anyone else’s. So let’s get to what is bothering you:The dreams are only dreams. My guess is that you are coming to terms with your own sexuality. Although easier than it once was, it is still sometimes very difficult to come out — both to self and others. One guess is that the dreams are not about the desire to do any of those things but are instead part of your processing the idea that your sexuality is unacceptable to some people.As for the way people’s eyes seem to you — I wonder if this is a metaphor as well. Is it possible that you worry about what other people are seeing when they look at you?Those are just guesses. I’d need to know more about you to help you really figure out what you are telling yourself. Yes, I know you don’t want me to tell you to see a therapist. But, really, a therapist can hear your whole story and can ask questions that hone in on the meaning of your dreams and your “visions”.At 18, you don’t need to tell your parents you want to see a therapist unless you want them to pay for it. You can see a school counselor or go to a local clinic and be assured of confidentiality.By the way: I don’t believe in the idea that anything is “just” stress. There is no “just” to it. Stress is, well, stressful. If your problems are stress-related, you may benefit from learning some new ways to destress yourself. That’s another thing a therapist can help you with.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for 6 months, during the first month we talked about marriage. I have been married before at 19 for only 3 months and I thought I was over it and didnt care. Now that I’m seeing my boyfriend and the thought of marriage came up I developed a generalized anxiety disorder and have been dealing with it. He is so good to me and sticks by my side no matter what but lately I’ve been having doubts if he is the one for me, or if I’m ready for marriage and basically just panicked.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Listen to your instincts. They are good. Talking about marriage in the first month of dating and pursuing the issue when you’ve never had more than 4 days together makes no sense at all. Of course you’re anxious. What’s the rush? I don’t think the problem is that you’re “gun shy” from a short marriage 7 years ago. I think your system is trying to slow you down.I’m also concerned that you aren’t more attracted to him. Yes, he may be wonderful. But attraction does matter. It shouldn’t be the only factor in your decision but it certainly should be considered.I think you should take a big step back. Put the marriage question on hold until you’ve had some quality and quantity time together. Give yourself time to get to know how you two click when you aren’t in “visit” mode. You need some time to get into daily routines and see how it works. If your boyfriend pressures you to move faster, there’s something amiss. A decision as important as who you’ll spend the rest of your life with deserves time and attention. If he truly loves you, he can slow down too.There’s a sweetness to the time of courtship. It’s a time to explore each other on many, many levels. It’s a time to learn everything from what kind of toast a person prefers to how to please each other physically. It’s a time to enjoy being the full focus of someone else’s love and attention. It’s a time to meet each other’s family and friends to see if there’s a good fit. It’s a time to talk about the endless possibilities that go into making a life together, from your personal goals to your hopes and dreams for a life together. Don’t shortchange yourselves. Enjoy the romance.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I have an older sister, 43 yr, who thinks she has Asperger’s Syndrome but never got officially tested. Knowing her for a long time, almost all of her behaviors fall in AS behaviors. I believe she needs to get officially tested and seek professional help, and I’ve told her this many times. However, she ignores the issue. The main issue is that I can’t convince her to seek help. Even if she has some other issues she still needs professional help and I can’t seem to be helping her. She is living a life like she is hiding from everything. She doesn’t like to socialize and has a very low self-esteem. I’ve tried many times to help her with basic life skills such as personal hygiene, organizing and social skills but she doesn’t seem caring for them. She, however, acknowledges that she is different than most and agrees that her behavior is childish. At times she become very stubborn when I confront her about her inappropriate behaviors. I thought that she realizing her unusual behavior being AS, was a milestone in dealing with her but I don’t know how to convince her to seek professional help.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You can’t control other people. You can provide your opinion about what you think your sister should do, but she is under no obligation to take your advice. Everyone has the right to decide what they want or don’t want to do with their lives.Make your case for why you think she should seek help but after that, you’ve done all you can. It is difficult to watch someone you love suffer, especially when you know that help is available. Unfortunately, there is little else that can be done. The only times that you would be able to force her to seek treatment would be if she were a danger to herself or to others, or if you were her legal guardian. Otherwise, your options are limited.Also, her not taking your advice is not a personal attack against you. Many people don’t seek treatment for mental health problems because of fear or denial. Those problems can be difficult to overcome.Perhaps, someday, she will take your advice. People often seek help when they are ready. Until then, try to be understanding, patient and supportive. Understandably, that’s not always easy. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 Sometimes, people will create an imaginary world when they are experiencing distress in their lives. It’s much easier to live in an imaginary world when one’s reality is painful. It’s a form of escapism. Some people are also prone to fantasies.You seem to have difficulty, at least on some occasions, distinguishing reality from non-reality. You have an emotional reaction to events that happen in your imaginary world. It’s not healthy, and it’s a sign of a potential problem, when you feel trapped or feel that you no longer know what is real. The fantasy world is also preventing you from developing relationships. It’s hurting you.It was wise to have made this inquiry about a potential psychological issue. My recommendation would be to see a therapist. It’s important to stay grounded in reality and a therapist can assist you with this. A therapist can also analyze why it is that you feel more comfortable in the fantasy world than in the real world.

I have been dating my boyfriend for 7 months now and everything started out fine but these last few months I have started noticing a pattern. He has told me absolutely CRAZY stories about himself, for example he is in the mafia, he is really sick with internal bleeding, he has broken ribs because he went to Russia to deal with the mafia, when he was in Russia fighting in a boxing tournament the mafia captured him and turned him into a soldier where he is basically indestructible now, that he had surgery for the internal bleeding, and random people I have never heard of are texting me from his phone (when I really just think its him)but he always seems to remind me to not tell anyone anything! And he told me that he is training with this guy named Ray Trakay and sent me a picture of him and I found the picture of the guy on the internet and it was Ray Lewis (which he happened to have a Ray Lewis app on his Iphone).<|im_end|>

 It is often the case that individuals have life problems but do not necessarily meet the criteria for any specific mental health disorder. I think this may be the case with your boyfriend. A diagnosis is difficult to pinpoint.You did not ask a specific question so I will give you my overall impression of the situation. Your concerns, I believe, are correct. There are many aspects of his behavior that are troublesome. He has the propensity to be a danger to himself and or others. Below is a list of major “red flags” that should concern you:You seem to be concerned about your safety. It is good that you are not ignoring the safety risk but you may be minimizing the potential danger of the situation. This is a relationship that you should consider terminating immediately. Do not hesitate to call the police if you believe that he may harm you, himself or others. Report any threats that he makes against you to the authorities immediately. I would also recommend becoming knowledgeable about the local domestic violence shelters or respite facilities and the procedures for a protection of abuse order (often referred to as “PFA”). You should be prepared if you need to utilize these services.Encourage him to continue his psychological treatment and medications. You should also consider reporting his behavior to his psychiatric treatment team. Due to privacy laws, they may be unable to discuss the details of this case with you but there is no law against reporting his behavior to them. That information is important and it can help the treatment team to better understand his case.As I described above, there are many aspects of his behavior that are worrisome and place you in potential danger. If you have a specific question, please do not hesitate to write again. Please be safe and take care.<|im_end|>"

Hello, for the past few months I have started to have strange visual hallucinations. Usually when I see things I become scared; I turn on the sink and blood comes out or a man will be standing by the top of the stairs when I’m walking up to my room. The hallucinations last seconds. I know that what I am seeing is not real but at the same time when it happens I am afraid for my life, when I see a person in my house I believe they’re really there(from another universe or something) until after the fact when I am calm and the hallucinations are gone. I remember as a young child I would hear a voice telling me to “do it” and I would get so angry that I would hurt myself but I’m not sure at what age that went away. I have also been having urges to do strange things… for example I woke up last week and had this urge to go dig a hole in my yard thinking there was something in the ground. I got up and did it because I believed it but looking back I know it was foolish for me to think something/someone was trapped in the ground.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It is difficult to know what may be wrong. Visual hallucinations are experienced by individuals who have schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and on less frequent occasions, major depression and bipolar disorder, if there are psychotic features present. Approximately 16 to 72 percent of individuals with schizophrenic disorders have reported experiencing visual hallucinations. In that way, they can be relatively common among individuals who have those disorders.Individuals can experience visual hallucinations in the absence of a psychotic disorder. In these cases, there may be an organic brain syndrome present. Some physical problems that may cause visual hallucinations include (but are not limited to): dementia, delirium, drug and alcohol withdrawal, severe sleep disturbances, migraine headaches, seizures or tumors. Generally it is recommended that an individual who is experiencing visual hallucinations be evaluated by both a psychiatrist and neurologist.Your parents are unwilling to allow you to see a psychiatrist. I would encourage you to inform your parents that visual hallucinations are possibly a sign of a neurological problem. It is very important that you are medically evaluated to rule out the possibility of neurological problems. It would also be helpful to share this information with your therapist. He may be able to help convince your parents that you need to see a neurologist and or a psychiatrist. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 Unwanted touch is unwanted touch. This man violated your sense of personal space. As a young child, you couldn’t understand sexuality but you could sense that something was wrong. It’s positive that your parents did listen to you and that the family gradually stopped visiting.As for the masturbating: Often young children do what is called a repetition compulsion. They repeatedly play about or imagine something bad that happened to them as a way to try to make sense of it. Unfortunately, the intrusion by this man got connected for you with sexual feelings.And also unfortunately, the more you masturbate to fantasies of this man, the more you will probably do it. Orgasm is a powerful feeling of pleasure and release. In your case, it is reinforcing the masturbatory behavior. You need to find another fantasy that arouses you and substitute it for the ones you’ve been using.This is important. If you don’t separate sex from an abusive fantasy, it will be difficult to have an intimate, loving, physical relationship with someone you love.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I don’t really hate my family but I wish something was different. My parents and my older brother are very similar- especially when it comes to how they feel about the person that I am dating. I have been together with my boyfriend for over 3 years, and we eventually want to marry each other. A huge obstacle is that my parents are super traditional, Korean parents. They don’t like that I am dating my boyfriend because he comes from a different background (he’s white) and is not college educated and doesn’t have a “successful” and “prestigious” career. My brother is a doctor and he has a girlfriend. Both  my parents and her parents approve of the relationship and therefore their relationship is much easier. My brother is going on a vacation with her and what frustrates me is that my mom doesn’t want me going on a vacation with my boyfriend and his family & friends. She says “when he’s ready to marry (finishes school and makes money like your brother) you then you guys can go on trips together. She goes “Of course my heart aches when I know your boyfriend cannot partake in our family affair but it’s because he’s not ready.

 A: Thanks for writing in with your question. The issues you describe here are probably not as uncommon as you think. It can be very difficult to balance cultural differences and nearly impossible to please everyone. It sounds like you respect your parents and want to make them happy, but it is time for you to think about your happiness and your future. You are an adult now and part of being an adult means making adult decisions, and being willing to deal with the consequences of those decisions. I mean no disrespect to your parents, but at the age of 27 I think you can decide who you want to date, and certainly who you want to go on vacation with. Your boyfriend and his family have every right to be “emotional” and upset. I’m sure they are feeling unfairly judged by your family. Just because your friends aren’t Asian, does not mean you can’t talk to them about your problems. People don’t have to have the same issues to lend an empathetic ear. However, if you need more support than what they can offer, I suggest that you look into finding a family therapist with a specialty in multi-cultural issues. If you plan to move forward in the relationship with your boyfriend, you may need professional support to help mend bridges with your family. Good luck with this important stage of your life. All the best,<|im_end|>"

From a teen in India: I’m an 17 yr old Indian with ADHD and i want to pursue medicine and PG in forensic medicine.I cannot concentrate even for two minutes and i’m afraid that it’ll affect my career. I got my 12th results yesterday and found it disappointing as i expected better grades.<|im_end|>

This is more complicated than perhaps you understand. You didn’t indicate how you were diagnosed with ADHD and how it is that your parents aren’t aware of it. If you were diagnosed by a professional, the next step is to get some treatment and to involve your parents in supporting it. But if you made a self-diagnosis, I think you may be incorrect about it.It looks to me like your relationship with your parents has become very stressful and distressing to you. You seem to be caught between your desire to make your own life and your loyalty to your parents and their expectations. One not very useful way out of this dilemma is to blame a disorder and to feel ashamed. Then it’s not your fault when you don’t do well on exams. But it also means you aren’t moving forward and doing what you need to do academically to meet your own goals.Even if you do have ADHD, it is not a reason to give up your goal. Many people with ADHD learn ways to make the symptoms of the disorder actually work for them. One person I know, for example, finds that the “distractability” that makes her move from task to task actually can be channeled so that she is an effective multil-tasker.At 17, it’s time for you to be less focused on what your parents want and to take charge of working toward making a life for yourself. Your mother is right that it’s a good idea to keep some options open. But you can still focus on what you really want. Hopefully, you can have a clear and respectful conversation with your parents about what you want to do. You can prove to them that you are serious by doing what you need to do to be successful.If ADHD is a factor, it’s important to share that information with your parents so they can support you in learning strategies for dealing with it. It is not going to go away. Most kids with ADHD do not “grow out of it”. Instead, they learn how to manage it. Please see a therapist who specializes in ADHD to get some practical help and support for self-management. If therapy is not an option, consider joining a forum here at PsychCentral. The forums provide a place for people who have similar issues to support and help each other.I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

  Part of the problem could be that you are choosing the wrong partners. Maybe they were not a match. In that case, ending those relationships would have been the right thing to do.Alternatively, your untreated anxiety and depression may be negatively impacting your relationships. Untreated mental health problems are not something that can be compartmentalized. They bleed into all aspects of life. Your depression and anxiety may be making it difficult for you to have a healthy relationship.A relationship is not going to fix this problem. The solution is counseling. You are an ideal candidate. These are exactly the types of problems that bring people into therapy.Once you begin to address the problems, that seem to have plagued you since childhood, you might find that your relationships improve. Ask your primary care physician for a referral or call the one 800 number on the back of your insurance card. They can help you find a local therapist who can help. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I’ll just start off by saying that opening sentences take me sometimes hours to write (this one took ten minutes).  The same goes for my life – I just can’t seem to get anything started:  Job applications, writing routines, relationships with the opposite sex, you name it.<|im_end|>

 Yes, I do think that your pattern of not examining the past IS affecting your future, but the real question is what are you most afraid of finding if you do look back and if you do feel?  Are you afraid of failure? What is your biggest fear if you did openly express yourself to your parents?  If you don’t have healthy ways to process emotions that come up in life they will likely build up over time and manifest in self-destructive ways. My guess is that this pattern is a large part of why you are feeling so paralyzed in your life.Look for healthier ways to deal with your emotions. Consider journaling your feelings, joining a men’s therapy group, or talk with an individual therapist to help you get to the emotional root of why you’re feeling reluctant to start your adult life. Cultivate encouraging and supportive male friendships. Exercise to relieve stress, improve mood, and feel a sense of accomplishment and power. You mentioned that you don’t have the sense of independence that you want but you’ve “learned to deal with it.” Your sense of independence is paramount at this stage of life so I encourage you to foster that desire, not to relinquish it. It is important to take action, even if it’s clumsy and things don’t turn out perfectly. Ask out the woman that you’re interested in, send out 5 job applications every day, speak openly with your parents about your feelings, start paying them rent or pay them by contributing to the care of the home and yard. If usually feels better to act, even when you don’t feel like it, than to feel powerless in your own life.I have a few questions about your parents. Why are your parents letting a capable 25-year-old adult son with a college education live in their home rent-free? Is it possible that they are enabling you to stay “stuck” at home because they are afraid of you leaving? Are you a buffer or a distraction that keeps them from dealing with marital problems? There may be some family issues contributing to your current dynamic.  Again, consider seeking help from a therapist to help you understand and resolve your internal struggle and understand any family dynamics that may be adding to your difficulty “growing up.”Take good care of yourself!Julie Hanks, LCSW<|im_end|>"

I am 16 years old. The bad: Already, I am obsessed with massive amounts of fame and money. I obsess over money. I want to have acres and mansions to my name. I want to have everybody know my name around the world and have celebrities come to my parties held at my massive palace estate. I want to be chased by paparazzi and I want to be on every talk show every weekend. I always want to be the center of attention. I want to own numerous companies that dominate the industry they sit in. I am willing to work as hard as I need to in order to obtain all of this. I have a 4.2 gpa with AP Classes, in addition to being multitalented in design, art, fashion, dancing, and more. This leads me to have a self-inflated image of myself where I consider myself to be more special and better than everyone else. I keep telling myself it is these traits that will lead to my fame and success. I am obsessed with success. If I do not achieve what I hope I will (fame, money, status, etc.) I will feel ashamed and feel like a complete failure. I will have failed my entire meaning to exist. I hate being under power. The only person I will ever love and accept being ruled by is God. I feel emotion, but not a lot of it. This pains me. When the closest person who I loved the most passed away, I had to force myself with all my might to muster a tear. I will forever hate myself for this. I wish I felt more emotion. I feel empathy for others but not as much as I know I should. All of this (everything I wrote above) every part of it makes me feel disgusting. I know it’s not right, but I don’t know how to fix it. I feel guilty, yet I will still chase it all in the end anyways, all while feeling guilty. The good: I want my brothers and parents to be just as successful. I want to spend massive amounts of money on the homeless and those in need. I love animals and women, and consider them to be the most innocent forms of life. I want to open numerous charities to help those in need. Please tell me what is wrong with me.<|im_end|>

It is impossible to diagnose over the Internet. A diagnosis would involve a thorough in-person evaluation. You’ve asked me to tell you what is wrong with you, but I’m sorry that I can only do that with an in-person evaluation.You have provided many details about your life and, without giving you a diagnosis, I can give you some insight into the issues that you have described. First of all, and most importantly, the fantasies that you are having, daydreams of wealth and power, famous friends etc., are not at all uncommon for teenagers.It’s hard, very hard to go from being a totally dependent child to being a responsible, independent adult. Your fantasies revolve around power. You stated that you dislike anyone having power over you, which is just another way of saying that you would like to have more power and this is incredibly common among teenagers. After all, that is the journey from childhood to adulthood, an exchange of power.Many persons, who have all the things that you desire, wealth, prestige, famous friends, paparazzi and more, are unhappy and turn to drugs in an attempt to provide them the happiness that they seek.Many famous people have purposely ended their lives. Their suicide is just another way to say that the achievement of fame and wealth and power were not enough to make them happy in life. It is simply untrue to believe that being famous, having money, etc., will make anyone happy.It is true to say that many people and most teenagers believe that it will. Those that continue to believe so will continue to be wrong.Most of the teenagers who have the fantasies that you have will, as they age and progress through life, realize that the important things in life are not the things that they believed during the transition from childhood to adulthood.The teenage years are really hard and most adults fail to appreciate this. I have yet to meet a teenager that would fail to benefit from good counseling. Parents and teachers are often just not enough.Good luck and please write back if you have any other questions.<|im_end|>"

I have been to a counselor about my depression, I am planning on going to her again soon, but I would like a second opinion. So I have been in college for close to 2 years now and I haven’t been able to make any friends. I feel alone a lot of the time. I usually listen to music to liven me up, but it hasn’t been working lately. My last roommate was one of my best friends from high school, but he dropped out of school. I now have a new roommate he is nice, but really shy around me. Just goes in his room and shuts his door when I am home too. I have been trying to keep a job, but I usually get in a depressed mood and don’t want to go anywhere, so I get fired or they assume I quit.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It also sounds as though you are effectively blaming yourself for not making new friends. It may not be your fault. You describe yourself as “boring” for a lack of partying but I would not have made that characterization. Not wanting to party is typically a sign of maturity. It may be that you simply have different interests than those with whom you currently associate; it will likely not always be that way.A significant concern about your depression is that it has hurt you occupationally. You stated that you can’t keep a job because of your depression. That is clear evidence of how depression is degrading the quality of your life.It’s encouraging that you are resuming therapy. In therapy, it will be important to analyze your social skills, your fears about approaching others, and what is the root of your depression. It’s unclear from your letter if your depression is caused by your current situation or some other factor.You should also consider medication to help improve your mood. Medication works best in tandem with psychotherapy. If you’re willing to engage in treatment, then you should expect a successful therapeutic outcome. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: First, I’m a survivor of a narcissistic parent. I’ve since recognized it, found a way to deal and stopped blaming myself. After over 10 years of marriage and 3 children, I’m now wondering if my husband is also a narcissist and emotionally abusing me because many things he does are just like what my parent did.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
I don’t know if he is a narcissist. I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of only a letter. But I can share your concern that you have put up with these behaviors because you were so well trained to do so by your narcissistic father. If so, don’t be hard on yourself. We are all drawn to what is most familiar, even when the familiar isn’t what is good for us.Only you can decide if your husband’s positive qualities outweigh the many hurtful things he does and says. The behaviors you describe are not the behaviors of someone who loves and cherishes his wife. But it may be that he is highly anxious himself and tries to manage that anxiety by being as in control of a situation as he can be.It may be helpful for the two of you to go to couples counseling for a few sessions to sort that out and to address some of the patterns in your relationship that are so difficult for you.If he won’t go, please go yourself. I think you would find it helpful to talk through any confusions you have about whether he is hurtful or if you are over-reactive due to your history with your parents.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: My older sister (first child) has only worked apx 12 years in her entire life and is almost 60. We had a traumatic childhood with an alcoholic mother, father died when she was almost 4. She never worked as a teen as my brother and I did, she stole mom’s credit cards and maxed them, ran up phone bill talking to boyfriend who was deployed to Guam. In short never had any initiative to support herself.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
What a difficult situation! You are torn between your compassion and your understanding that, at 60, she is unlikely to change a lifelong pattern. It’s unclear whether she is mentally ill or if she is someone who would rather take advantage of others than take care of herself. Either way, by your account, she hasn’t been willing to seek help or to make changes on her own. It’s very, very difficult to take care of people who stubbornly won’t participate in that care.You can certainly offer her emotional support but I think it would be unwise for you to let her move in — unless you are willing to be taken advantage of for the rest of her life. You could make a list of local resources and phone numbers for her. At this point, she may be incapable of researching that on her own. What she does with the list may give you more information about her state of mind. Will she make some calls or will she look to you to do even that?Since the only information I have is from your letter, I can’t offer you more than that. However –You need and deserve support and practical advice for dealing with a family member who is chronically ill. I strongly suggest that you contact the local chapter of NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) and attend one of the support groups for family members. Members offer each other support and advice. Chances are that participants will be able to point you to some local services. In addition, consider joining a forum here at PsychCentral to hear how others in a similar position have managed to walk that fine line between being supportive without being enabling.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From Canada: I met an American who is living in The Philippines online a few months ago. She was promised a modelling job when she got there. When she got there things were not as they seemed and she ran away from where she was supposed to work. At the time I was gambling too much and was tired to losing money to gambling. So I decided to donate money to her to pay for her power bill. It felt good to donate to someone in need instead of spending the money on gambling. But overtime I realized that she constantly wanted money.<|im_end|>

 What a terrible dilemma. You are a decent person trying to do the decent thing but I think you are being used. You don’t really know this woman. You only know what she has chosen to share with you online. She is blackmailing you emotionally by her threats of death if you don’t take care of her. You really don’t know if the pictures are real or if the “friend” is telling the truth.The fact is that a hospital is unlikely to keep someone in a bed if the person doesn’t need it. There are sick people who do need the bed. The hospital doesn’t want to incur more expense by keeping her there. I think this woman is taking advantage of your generosity and good nature.As an American, she can turn to the American embassy for help. I suggest you give her this address: http://manila.usembassy.gov/service/information-for-travelers.html. They can do far more for her than you can. Then block her from your phone and your email. This is one gamble that you lost. It’s time to cut your losses and leave this “game”.Meanwhile, please do work on getting your gambling addiction under control. It has now sneaked into other aspects of your life. You are vulnerable to more hurt if you don’t treat the root of the problem — an addiction to taking chances. Look into treatment programs in your area or find a therapist who specializes in addictions. You deserve to have support.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My 32-year-old bothers is a former Meth addict. He has been clean for few months. He’s been recently arrested for driving on a suspended license and for possession of a controlled substance. After he got out of jail he showed up at my house uninvited and demanded me to support him because he was homeless! We live in a rural area and I could not ask him to leave on foot in winter. I am disabled with early onset dementia, seizures, autoimmune disorder and PTSD, and my husband has military related PTSD. We are on edge constantly because my brother says he will not leave our house even though he has a misdemeanor warrant. He is a pathological liar, and blames me for being a bad sister, because I would not help him get off the streets after our parents died! He has been smoking weed since he was 15 years old, did mushrooms, drank and now Meth. He used my husband’s credit account without permission, put us in 10k debt, he blames me for not helping him with money and I left him homeless. Last year I broth him to my house tried to help him, I bought him brand new clothes, but he stole at the store. So I drove him back to CA. See, my parents use to take care of him financially, he lived with them and now he wants me to support him. We can’t afford him! calls me names, hits himself on the head when mad. He tells me to shut up when I tell him to turn himself in for his warrant, he constantly yells. He refuses to listen and disrespect me. My husband won’t throw him out, because he is family. I don’t know what to do. We live in NV and his warrants are in CA, so he says he won’t go back, because he doesn’t want me to leave him homeless there! I really don’t want him at my house! We have been estranged for years and now he wants to make me feel like I am a bad sibling and it is my duty to take care of him. I’m too sick to think straight! I feel like everyone is taking advantage of me because sometimes I forget things. I feel like a victim. Am I wrong for not wanting him around? Thank you!<|im_end|>

 You have problems. Your husband has problems. As adults, it is your job to solve your problems. Would it be right to ask your brother to take responsibility for your problems and to solve those problems for you? No, because he has his own problems to deal with. He only has so much money and so many hours in a day, to solve his own problems and he may not have any extra money or extra time to work on your problems. Knowing all of this, it would be very wrong of you to ask him to take responsibility for your problems and spend his time and energy solving your problems, rather than his own.If it is wrong of you to ask him to spend his limited time and money solving your problems, then it is wrong of him to ask you to spend your limited time and money solving his problems.You must find the money to pay for your electric bill, your house payment, your medical costs, your taxes, your car insurance, etc. You have very little money left at the end of the month and the little you have may be needed to be applied to next month’s bills or for an unexpected expense.It is the universal expectation that parents raise children to maturity and from that point on, the child is expected to care for him or herself. If you were to assume the responsibilities for your brother’s care, the same responsibilities that your brother has refused to accept for himself, who would take care of your brother if you became disabled or died?Your brother has done a poor job of caring for himself. He has chosen a life of irresponsibility, drug usage and prison. He is now siphoning off your life resources, the very resources that you and your husband need to survive. Remember, it is your brother’s choices that has caused him to prosper or to suffer. He chose to use illegal drugs and that choice has lessened the quality of his life. He chose to commit criminal acts that resulted in his imprisonment. He is not a victim of life. He is the victim of his own choices. Anyone who makes the choices he’s made, will find themselves living a similar life.You and your husband have made your own choices. Apparently, you did not choose drug usage or to become a criminal. You have prospered more than your brother, not because of better luck but because of better choices. If your brother continues to make bad choices, there is nothing in this entire world that you might do to actually help him.By including him in your life, you have reduced the quality of your life. You have less time, less money and less happiness. Even with those sacrifices, how have you actually helped him them? In reality, the sacrifices have done no more than given him a place to hide from the law and the small amount of time before he is once again imprisoned.The choice is of course yours. We all have a limited amount of time and money that we can devote to helping others. By all means, spend that time and money helping others and surely you will be doing God’s work upon this earth. However, spend your time and money wisely. Do the most good with what you have to spend. Buy the most good. Do the most good that you can with your limited resources. Good luck in the future and with your choices.<|im_end|>"

I’m a teen who has been diagnosed with depression and is currently receiving medication and therapy for it. But the medication just doesn’t seem to be working, even on the highest dose.

If you have any techniques or strategies to help deal with these symptoms, that would be great.<|im_end|>

These two resources will help you reduce your negative feelings, and motivate you toward nurturing your own strengths.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I have been feeling very lonely and empty lately, and has affected many things in my life currently. I have a history of clinical depression and have been diagnosed with it back in 2009 and suffered for four years intensely being committed in and out of inpatient facilities due to suicidal behaviors for a long time. From fall of 2013 to summer of 2014 I had no issues with depression and decided to move for a fresh start and picked a small ski town which had very little to offer for mental health resources. And about three months ago my depression has slowly been getting worse and worse everyday, I have tried very hard to reach out for help during this time and I’m having huge difficulty because I have to wait three weeks at a time to see some sort of mental health clinician for help. Even worse is that seeing a psychiatrist here means having to wait 2-4 months which is depressing to even thinking about waiting that long. I don’t have a taste for any mood altering substances besides smoking cannabis, I hate alcohol and try to avoid it at all cost. I’m very desperate to get help, it’s been very struggling and have been undergoing major mood swings and high anxiety which makes it very hard to do anything really. If there’s anything this website can do for me, it may make a big difference for me. At this rate of my mood has been, I don’t how much longer I can keep up with this before it starts to seriously affect me in ways I don’t need.<|im_end|>

 Access to treatment seems to be your main issue. You may want to utilize the Psych Central discussion boards which allow you to communicate with others who may be experiencing similar issues. The discussion board is not meant to replace mental health treatment but it can provide social support while awaiting access to face-to-face treatment.Another option to explore is online therapy. Generally speaking, studies show that people who utilize Internet-delivered treatment options for depression have lower rates of depression than people who undergo no treatment at all. Other studies show that online therapy is comparable to face-to-face treatment.Depression is a highly treatable disorder. Ideally, face-to-face therapy would be your best option. You stated in your letter that you moved to a place where it is difficult to access treatment. Perhaps you should consider moving to a place where it is easier to access treatment. Understandably, you may not want to move again but undoubtedly depression is decreasing the quality of your life. If you have to move in order to seek treatment for depression, I would think it to be both necessary and desirable. You have to do what is necessary to help you to get better. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I am coming to this site for a few reasons. My roommate and good friend is a psychology student. He fears that I may have some psychological issues that stem from a wide variety of childhood abuse I endured at a young age. Since I’m young and on my own, I can’t really afford professional help, but I don’t want to scare myself with information on the internet that doesn’t cater to my exact situation.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 There is a good chance that the problems you are currently experiencing stem from your abusive childhood. Your childhood was characterized by abuse, neglect and abandonment. The very people who were supposed to love, care and protect you harmed you and abandoned you. Thankfully you had your grandparents who did the best they could but still fell short.You stated that you feel “stupid” for feeling the way you do but you shouldn’t. What happened to you was not your fault. No one easily “gets over” an abusive childhood. Your formative years were damaged by your parents. Having had an abusive childhood does not mean that you are irreparably damaged. There is damage from childhood for many people, if not most. The degree of damage varies but nonetheless the damage must be corrected. Therapy is a corrective process.If you’re in college, then in all likelihood you can receive free psychological services through the counseling center. It would be advantageous for you to see a therapist to deal with the psychological pain that is degrading your life. It would be ill-advised to ignore your psychological pain or attempt to deal with it on your own. Psychotherapists are trained to deal with the very problems with which you struggle. Seeking professional psychological help would be the most efficient way to deal with this problem. Many people who are in counseling are dealing with issues that stem from childhood. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

<|im_start|>assistant
 Given your situation, how you feel makes sense. You had been in a relationship for nearly 30 years and now it’s over. During that time you didn’t have many or any connections to other people or family. Therefore, you didn’t socialize and thus connecting with others seems difficult.In addition, you mentioned that you recently stopped using drugs. You didn’t say how long you had used drugs. It may have been for years or perhaps even decades. If that were true then, psychologically, you were accustomed to being high and feeling a particular way. Feeling normal was feeling high. You’re going to feel differently, now that you are off drugs. That’s yet another major change in your life.What’s making these major life changes more difficult is your lack of a support system. Having a support system has many important and positive benefits. It can help decrease stress, isolation, depression, and so forth. We all would benefit from a good support system.I would recommend individual and or group counseling. It will provide support and guidance as you adapt to these new life changes. Having supportive relationships will buffer the stress that invariably comes from life changes. Contact your primary care physician and ask for referrals. That would be a good place to start.<|im_end|>"

I grew up in a home with an alcoholic father who used to tell me every single day that I am a piece of sh* and I will fail in life, grandparent who used to tell me nobody will ever love me, and a mother who would pass condescending remarks about my looks. I spent year defying their words, in words and in action, not believing them and being filled with anger and feeling of injustice that they talked to me like this. Now my mother constantly tells me how pretty I am, I have managed to get to a place in life that has always been my goal. But with every year my self-esteem is spiraling downwards, the voices that say I will fail and I amount to nothing are haunting me but I can’t find the grit from my teen years to shut them up. I don’t understand, I went through the worst full of pride and feeling of self worth despite all the nasty words and experiences and now I’m where I wanted to be and I’m crumbling under the weight of self-loathing and anxiety. I have visited therapists and can more or less manage and get out of episodes of depression and anxiety (although it takes at least a couple of weeks each time), but they keep coming back and every time another piece of my self-esteem is chipped away for good. Why was I stronger then?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It’s not so much that you were stronger then, it’s just that your mission was clear. You wanted to become the opposite of what they declared your were. I admire the grit you’ve shown — as well as the courage and persistence in correcting the issues from your family of origin. But now it’s time for a different strategy. We can only move away from something for so long before we have to start moving toward something. You have clearly demonstrated that you can be different than what your family told you, but being opposite only identifies you as not what they thought you were. It does not help define your authentic self.It is time for you to figure out who you are and who you want to be independent of this push from your family of origin. This requires two things. The first is to find a support network to help you with this. Friends are a good place to start, but from a therapeutic point of you may find group therapy a next natural step. In group you’ll have people who will both support and challenge you in fostering your growth.The second thing is choosing a goal that is not simply different than what your family told you. Find some part of yourself that needs to flourish and grow — and nurture that. Take some time to sample. Figuring out who you are, not just who you’re not, is the work in front of you.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Lately especially, but i have felt this way for a very long time, I think about killing people, animals, or general destruction of surrounding items. I have been extremely fascinated by horror and gore. i have never found it scary or disgusting but actually the opposite. i enjoy it a lot. i don’t really bother watching movies unless there is someone being terrorized. in class or everyday life my mind wonders to heavy detailed scenarios in which i am hurting or killing someone. i don’t purposely think about it but once i do i don’t try to stop it either. i tend to enjoy it to be honest. i don’t really care who is in the “day dream” or what they are saying or feeling. i don’t really care if they know me or if I’ve known them in a close relationship. i think about my “friend” or my whole family dying a lot and it doesn’t bother me at all. i just don’t care really. today i had a thought about killing my “friend” because she tried to talk to me during lunch. she told me ” you don’t understand basic human feelings” and i honestly don’t. she was sad and i couldn’t care if i tried. i have people who want to talk to me but it end to get very angry at the thought of someone trying to interact with me. i have been planning murders and ways to get away with them for a very long time now. i could watch everyone i know die and not cry at all. i have no problem with lying to or manipulating the people closest to me to get what i want to cause them to be inconvenienced. i fell like people are out to get me a lot. and sometimes i see or hear things that aren’t their. the things i see are usually people hurt and the things i hear are usually people telling me things to do that are “bad” i sometimes hear things in music that weren’t said either. is there something wrong with me? should i care? and why do i love the idea of causing pain and suffering?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Yes, you should care. Your thoughts and feelings are abnormal. They might indicate that something is wrong. Happy, well-adjusted people don’t fantasize about killing.You did not provide information about your day-to-day life or about what could be wrong. If I were interviewing you in person, I would inquire about your current life situation. It would help me to understand why you might be having these fantasies. Sometimes, when people experience personal hardships in their own lives, they have fantasies about power, control and domination.It would be best for you to stop watching films and or reading materials that encourage these types of fantasies. Avoid them altogether.If this continues to be a problem, you should be evaluated by a mental health professional. He or she could determine what’s wrong and help you to develop new ways of thinking about the world.Finally, if you feel as though you can’t control your behavior, then call emergency services or go to the hospital. They can protect you from harming yourself or others. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 Your problems are not unworthy or petty. Your problems are your problems and they are giving you pain. I’m happy to try to be helpful.To give your parents the benefit of the doubt: They may think that comparing you to your brother will inspire you to do better. Unfortunately, it’s a strategy that seldom works. Your brother is your brother. You are you. You each have talents and gifts and interests of your own. Sadly, pressuring you to be like your brother is preventing you from finding yourself.At this point, you have adopted a strategy that may be relieving some of the pressure but is making things even tougher for you. Procrastinating and avoiding means that you don’t “fail” at something. You can tell yourself that if you did it, it would be fine. It’s a strategy that saves your pride but ultimately will set you back.One thing you are apparently good at is social skills. You know how to make other people comfortable. Not everyone can do that. That’s an important asset in making friends. So — let’s start from the beginning.I suggest you seriously cut back on extra-curricular activities that don’t give you joy. Not everyone is cut out for athletics. Not everyone can juggle many, many activities and do well.Really think about what gives you satisfaction and makes you feel alive. I’m hoping that there is something within that realm that will put you in touch with people who share your interests. A bonus as far as your self-esteem goes would be if that activity makes some kind of contribution towards making the world a better place. If you get really engaged in that activity, chances are that friendships will naturally evolve — especially since you know how to make other people laugh.Limit yourself to doing that activity and school. It’s better for you to do two things well instead of a lot of things badly. Many successful people are terrific at only one or two endeavors. Think about the famous people you have heard of. Most of them have focused on one major interest and have become very, very good at it.Do try to talk to your parents. This is going to take every bit of maturity you’ve got. Calmly, tell them you understand that they mean well and want the best for you. Explain that you are very different from your brother and that being compared negatively to him is making you miserable. And here’s the most important thing: Give them a plan. Ask for their support in focusing on school and the one thing that you’ve chosen to give life more meaning. If they hear that you see a problem and have a strategy for solving it, they may feel relieved. They may be motivated to be helpful if they know what kind of help you need.If you don’t succeed in getting their support, start working on your plan on your own. Stop relying on “luck” and take charge of your own life. Dress for success. Get enough sleep and take care of your body. Research does show that when we treat ourselves well and act “as if” we are already at our goal, we have a better chance of getting there.Once you have some success, do enlist the help of your school counselor or a teacher you trust in talking to your folks. We parents don’t always get the kid we had in mind. Instead, we often get someone who shows us equally valuable traits that enrich our lives in unexpected ways.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

So, I have known for a while now but think I have been in denial. My mum would always hid away to answer a phone call, Which I noticed wasn’t her usual phone. Me and my sister’s never addressed it to be anything. I found the phone and looked at the messages, I know I shouldn’t have, and there were messages clearly stating that she was seeing someone else other than my dad. I haven’t told anyone as Im worried that they will say that I need to let my dad know and I don’t want to break up the family, and worried that they will judge me for keeping it a secret for so long, but she is having more and more of these phone calls, and i really don’t know what to do.

  I would have a very different answer if you were very young, but at 25 I would confront your mother alone directly. Let her know that you are aware and that it is too difficult for you to keep this secret. Talk only about your own feelings — not about your mother’s behavior. You are the world’s expert on your feelings and you have a right not to be put it the situation where you have to keep a secret from your dad.I know you say you don’t want to break up the family, but if you found this out how hard is it going to be for your father to find out? These things typically are only a matter of time before they blow up. Then you’ll be in the predicament of having known and kept it from your dad.This isn’t about saving the family now — this is about taking good care of yourself. Don’t try to script this for your mom — don’t tell her what to do or not do. Just be clear that you having to keep a secret any longer won’t work, and she has to do something because you won’t keep this secret from your dad. This isn’t a threat. This is what you know to be true for you. If this continues the pressure on you will continue.This is a very difficult situation but I would be as honest as you can with your mom and put the ball in her court. Set a timeline for her and don’t be afraid to remind her. She may not like it, but she’s put you in a terrible position and now it is time for her to deal with that reality.As you get ready to do this I would highly recommend getting some individual psychotherapy. You may want to get this support immediately so that you have someplace to go as you deal with your mom.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From Canada: I’m currently in a BA degree and my question is – what should I do if my professor reminds me of my abuser?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I wish you could drop the course. Ideally, you should get some needed treatment before you will be ready to deal with something like this on a daily basis. Is there any way you can put off taking this particular class until another year?If not — here are some suggestions:If all that doesn’t work, you might want to try to talk with the prof. You don’t owe him any explanations. You can simply state that you would prefer that he not hover near you. If he presses for information, thank him for his concern, reassure him that it has nothing to do with him and restate that you prefer not to go into it. Then say a polite thank you and leave.You said you have never had treatment for the abuse. I imagine there is a counseling service in your school. Please take advantage of it. Recovering from 10 years of abuse is generally not something a person can do on their own. You deserve the support and guidance of an experienced counselor.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 What you say in your letter does concern me. Professionals don’t offer diagnoses on the basis of a third party report. Most would welcome your involvement or would refer the two of you to a couples’ therapist. I’m especially concerned about the frequency and length of his sessions, which is highly unusual. It’s unlikely insurance would pay for it at the usual and customary rate. People who need that level of support are often referred to an in-patient stay.On the other hand, it occurs to me that the only information you have about the therapist’s behavior and even the frequency and length of sessions is from your boyfriend. Is it possible that he is exaggerating or lying about his therapist’s involvement for his own purposes?Before concluding that the therapist is too controlling, please do have a very honest conversation with the boyfriend. If you remain concerned about the therapist’s ethics, then contact your state’s board of registration to make a complaint. Your therapist can help you find the contact information.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

The simple answer is “no”. You don’t share interests. You don’t feel safe in her home because of her brother. You don’t like spending time with her. This is not what goes on between good friends.However, it’s important to understand that not all friendships are the same. There are levels of friendships.Close Friends: A very few people become close, close friends. They are the people who share many of our interests and with whom we feel very comfortable and supported. Best friends share their dreams and their problems because they know they will be understood and supported.Friendly but not Friends: Another kind of “friend” is someone we see often, like the woman you described, but who is not a person we would pick to be close to. Since you see each other a lot, it’s important to remain friendly without becoming close. Conversations are kept very general and polite. Such people don’t expect each other to spend time together outside of work hours. The person you described probably fits in this category.Acquaintances – people we don’t really know well but are maybe friends of friends or people in the community we get to know because we bump into them regularly. These are the people we wave to politely or say “hello” to when we happen to see them. There is either no interest or no time to get to know them better. (Sometimes acquaintances do become friends if there is opportunity to spend time together but it isn’t expected.)I hope you take a step back from this relationships. Be on the look out for someone you find more interesting and approachable. Really good friends are sometimes hard to find but it is definitely worth the effort.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I am a shy person by nature, I generally dislike and don’t care to be social. But in this past year I’ve gone further than that, rather what I would call paranoid tendencies.

 It’s normal to be slightly anxious and cautious when meeting new people, but your anxiety seems to be greater than that. Your fears seem to have evolved into a phobia of sorts that causes significant daily distress.This problem is not unlike people who become homebound due to their belief that the outside world is a dangerous place (agoraphobia). A phobia is an irrational fear. Irrational fears are strengthened when an individual acts in accordance with their fears. It’s important to believe in reality and act in accordance with it. Doing so will extinguish fears and paranoia.The solution to this problem is to seek treatment from a mental health professional. You might be reluctant because of your paranoia, but try to force yourself to go through with it. It’s important that you do so. Unchecked paranoia and anxiety typically worsens but treatment can prevent this from happening. With the proper treatment, you will learn that your fears are unrealistic. You can also learn how to be more comfortable with people. Those changes would significantly improve your life.If you ignore this problem, it will likely continue. One of the most tragic realities of our time is that effective treatments exist for most mental health problems but the majority of people suffering with them don’t seek treatment. I hope that you make the right choice and seek treatment for a curable problem. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 I don’t know what is possible for you in your country. If you were in the U.S., I’d be suggesting you think hard about whether you want to stay with someone who is as controlling and abusive as your husband. He keeps you off balance and submissive with his fault-finding, accusations, his bad temper and his unreasonable demands. He is unlikely to change.No woman deserves to be beaten by the person she loves most. No child should grow up watching her mother be physically and emotionally abused by her father. She is learning that this is what she can expect from a relationship someday.Since he won’t go to counseling, please go yourself. You need the perspective, guidance and support that counseling offers. You are a smart woman — smart enough to be doing graduate work. Now be smart about your personal life too.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I have been with my husband for 9 years and we have 3 young children. I recently came to the realization that he has been verbally and physically abusing me for virtually the entire relationship. He has always called me horrible names and said downright mean things. The physical abuse started shortly after my first child was born. He was drunk and pulled me outside by my hair and locked me out. Since that time he has hit me, pushed me, slapped me, broken my things, threatened suicide multiple times, and most recently, he choked me out. I called the police that time; he was arrested and convicted of spousal battery.<|im_end|>

 Your abuser is still abusing you. Instead of taking full responsibility for his behavior, he is blaming you. You are so beaten down emotionally from years of abuse, you are questioning yourself. So — no, I don’t think you are an abuser. I think you’ve tried to defend yourself as best you can. You are a victim who has been victimized so much that you are even vulnerable to thinking you are a victimizer.You and your kids need help to extricate yourself from this relationship and to re-orient your thinking. Please, please call The Alliance Against Family Violence and Sexual Assault. AAFVSA is a nonprofit organization that was started in your area and that is committed to stop domestic violence and sexual assault. Their 24-Hour Hotline is (661) 327-1091. They can provide counseling for you and the kids, child care, case management, shelter if you need it, and on-going support.Despite being in a batterers program, your husband is showing that he isn’t going to stop the abuse. So it’s up to you to protect yourself and your children. But you don’t have to do it on your own. Please reach out and get the help you need.One caution: Abusers often up the abuse when they find out their victim is looking for help. Delete this response from your computer. Use a friend’s phone or a computer at your local library to make contact with AAFVSA. The counselor on the hotline will give you guidance on how to protect yourself and the kids.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My boyfriend and I have been together for 1 yr and a half. For this entire time we have never been happier, I love him to death and he loves me. We are loving towards each other, we communicate well about our issues and resolve them by talking. My boyfriend once lied to me about who he went swimming in this pond near his house with. He told me he went with a couple of his friends and left out Danielle (Danielle is a girl we had issues with because I had feelings that something happened between them, Danielle is very good friends with his mom so he would be at his house often and he would usually walk her home late at night). After I confronted him about the strong hunch I had that that story was not complete he confessed did not tell me about her being there because he claimed he did not want me to think anything happened between them. I told him if nothing happened then it shouldn’t be an issue to tell me about her. He understood, apologized severely and promised to be open with me regardless of the situation. I forgave him and moved on.<|im_end|>

 I would rather trust a woman’s instinct than a man’s reason. ~Stanley BaldwinFor me this is at the very core of a relationship. In the long run this is a deal-breaker because trust is the very essence of love. Without it there can’t be a healthy relationship. I would make this a central focus now and explain what it has done to you, why it needs to be addressed and explain that if he wants to keep the relationship going that this has to be resolved. Otherwise you are building your love on sand at the edge of an ocean of potential lies.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Sometimes, especially when something traumatic has or is about to happen, I have these sort of black outs. It hurts like I am being pushed aside. I call them black outs, but I remember a small bit of what happened, how I couldn’t really control what I did. They like causing me pain, and laugh at me when I try to fight it. I don’t remember quite what happens, only how much it hurts and how funny they think it is for me to do so. The last time this happened I was texting my fiancé, and I started having an episode. When they took over, They told him that I should get a new nickname, Patches. Then continued to say that they would leave a scar to remind him. I woke back up holding the phone to my ear and my fiancé telling me to wake up. There is a small patch carved into my leg along with a few eraser burns. And all I can think about now, is the name, and how much they enjoyed the pain, and how, in a sick twisted way I do too. I have become reclusive, and I am afraid of my own shadow. The only person I can really talk to now is my fiancé. I am afraid that one day I am going to hurt someone, but I don’t want to get put away cause I am normal on the outside, suggestions?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It’s important that your blackouts are investigated. It is especially concerning that your self-injuring during these episodes. These are unusual occurrences.What may be happening is that you are disassociating from what you anticipate to be an emotionally painful experience. It doesn’t seem as though this is happening consciously but you may be unconsciously influencing these episodes.Discuss these symptoms with your primary care physician. He or she will likely conduct an evaluation. If further evaluation is necessary, you will likely be referred to a mental health professional. Hypnosis might be a useful tool in uncovering the nature of these blackouts, but you will have to discuss this and other potential options with your treating professionals.In the meantime, you should be documenting each of these episodes. Include information such as: What happened prior to your blacking out? What were you doing? How were you feeling? What were you thinking? What were you doing when you regained consciousness? How long did it last?You might even consider videotaping the event, if possible. Virtually every smart phone has a videotape function. Understandably, the footage may be difficult to watch but having such documentation might be invaluable in learning the cause and nature of your blackouts. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

First of all, I didn’t know which topic to put it under, since it also involves my husband, and the other, that being psychosis, but since I’m the person feeling it, I believe it should be psychosis. Allow me to explain-both me and my husband have been diagnosed with some very serious disorders-mine being a VERY severe case of OCD, and my husband schizoaffective disorder, more leaning toward bipolar. I’m going to just my psychiatrist. I occasionally go to my counselor, but not enough to get any help from her. My husband, however, has not been to either in a very long time, and every now and then, after I beg him, literally getting on my knees and clasping my hands together, he takes his lamictal. I can see him now distancing himself away from me. He just very recently (yesterday) started shutting me out completely, forming a wall. I asked him if he could let me in. He didn’t even respond! Then, after about ten minutes, he went to bed. I started feeling something I never had before-it was this sort of lightheaded, woozy, almost like detached feeling that I have even now. I know where I am, I’m looking around this room I’m in it, but I’m not. The only word I can use is detached from reality. I also want to scream out loud, but I don’t dare, since it will wake up my husband. What is going on? Why do I feel like this? I feel like I’ve lost my grip, and before long, I won’t be able to hold on-what do I do?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Feeling detached from reality may or may not be a symptom of psychosis. You may be describing a dissociative symptom. Derealization and depersonalization are clinical terms associated with feeling detached from reality. Derealization involves feeling as though the external world is not real. Depersonalization is the feeling of being detached or estranged from oneself. There are a number of reasons why these symptoms may develop, several of which include: severe lack of sleep, substance abuse, side effect of a medication, and significant stress. Whether or not your new symptom is associated with psychosis could only be determined by a thorough psychological evaluation.It’s possible that you have developed this new symptom in response to the stress associated with caring for your husband. He has been “shutting you out” and he isn’t taking his medication. Those two problems would suggest that he’s not doing well. Undoubtedly, this is affecting you. It may be increasing your stress levels and exacerbating your symptoms.It’s imperative that you report this new development to your psychiatrist immediately. Attend therapy on a more regular basis. It could help you to stay grounded in reality. Immediate intervention could help you return to a normal level of functioning. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Dear Little Sister,First – this is not your fault. Both your “friend” and your brother are playing a deadly game. She seems to be getting off on jerking your brother around. He seems to have an idea that if he threatens to kill himself, she’ll come to her senses and be with him. They both count on you to carry messages. Your brother wants you to tell your friend about his plans so she can come running and convince him to stay alive. Your friend wants you to tell her how she is affecting your brother. (By the way, you would not be putting anything on her shoulders that she didn’t invite there if you were to tell her. ) The whole thing is very complicated and very unfair to you! And dangerous. It’s all high drama but it could backfire terribly. Neither of these people seems very well balanced right now.There are some confidences that are not meant to be kept. Killing self or someone else is at the top of the list. Go immediately to your parents. Show them the whole letter you sent me. They need to take him to be evaluated and perhaps hospitalized. (It might be helpful for them to show your letter to the doctor since you know more details than they do.) If your brother doesn’t meet criteria for hospital admission, your folks need to have him on a 24/7 suicide watch. That means someone stays with him every minute until it is certain that he has worked this crazy infatuation through. The girl and/or her parents should also be called. It’s not her fault that your brother has gotten so worked up by her but I do think she has a moral obligation to stop playing her games.I wish all of you well.Dr. Mariep.s. You might want to think about what kind of person you are hanging around with. A real friend wouldn’t be targeting your brother like this.<|im_end|>"

 Long term derpession is exhausting and demoralizing. I’m so so sorry that you have been suffering for so long. People who love you may find it intolerable to think that you are this unhappy and discouraged. In their own feelings of helplessness, they might minimize your pain. My guess is that it’s not that they don’t care, it’s that they can’t stand it that they haven’t found a way to help you feel better. But – first things first. Before you resign yourself to living like this, I hope you will make another appointment with your doctor. Make sure you schedule enough time for a complete review of your situation. The symptoms of depression can be a result of a number of things including an underlying medical condition, medication side effects and interactions, and/or a sleep disorder. The trouble is that a depression that stems from a life stress (like terrible losses) or inadequate coping skills, looks very much the same as a depression that is caused by something else. If you haven’t had a complete physical in awhile, ask your doctor to give you a thorough check up. This should include labs to check for such things as infection, thyroid, and liver function, as well as vitamin deficiencies and electrolyte imbalances. Make sure your doctor has a complete list of every medicine you are taking, even over the counter medicines like pain relievers and cough medicine. Medicines that seem too ordinary to even mention may be interacting with the drugs your doctor is giving you to help the depression. Please, please be honest with your doctor. If you drink alcohol (even a little) or use street drugs, they may also be contributing to the problem If you aren’t sleeping well, tell your doctor that too. Irregular sleep patterns can also contribute to depression.Doctors are under a lot of pressure these days to see many patients in too little time. If your doctor isn’t willing or able to listen to you or to give you a thorough work up, it may be time for a second opinion. You need someone who will take the time to do the detective work necessary to discover if there is something that has been missed in the past that has contributed to so many years of suffering.If everything medical checks out, then I suggest that you see a psychiatrist for a trial of anti-depressants and a counselor to learn ways to manage the depression. A healthy lifestyle that includes a balanced diet and regular, aerobic exercise will help too. A good book to look at is Feeling Good by David Burns and Aaron Beck. Doing all this is a lot of work. If it feels just too overwhelming, you may need a buddy or two to help you out. My experience is that people are more willing to be helpful when they are given something manageable and concrete to do. Maybe someone could go with you to appointments and help you advocate for yourself with doctors. Maybe someone would be willing to take a walk with you every day. Maybe someone else would be willing to work through the Burns and Beck book with you. Finally, sometimes it is helpful to ask your psychiatrist to include your support people in a session or two to explain what depression is about and to think together about how best to help you.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I am from India. Recently I joined a big MNC. This is my first shot in corporate world and since I am a survivor of repeated child sexual abuse, I have very low self esteem, trust and sharing issues I already am not sure if I will be able to survive in this cut throat world. So this happened on an official vacation. I used to think that my boss doesn’t like me at all. So when he started talking to me I was really happy. But then he asked me to accompany him to the beach. It was 11 in the night. Completely sure that he would do nothing, I went (now I can’t stop blaming myself for that stupid decision). Then it started getting really uncomfortable and scary for me. He made sexual advances but I didn’t allow him to do anything. Then he said he was only testing me because he thought I was too mellow for this corporate life and I need to become more fierce. After that my already low confidence is now at a negative level. After that night he acted like nothing happened and it really bugged me. Now I am having dreams about him and I have started developing feelings for him. I am hating myself for it. I feel that because of my past and the fact that I haven’t shared it with anyone in this world I have become really desperate for love and relationship which I have never had. I want to be loved, I want to be valued but since I am overweight I fear I will never get that love. I want to get over my past which I am not able to. Those memories haunt me. Those men, their touch, my attempts to cut myself with blades when I was just 8 or 9 (I would cut my hands, let them bleed and then wash off and carry on normally with my life; my family being unaware of everything). Everything haunts me and I hate myself and when a guy even for wrong reasons said he likes me, I melted. This is so wrong on my part. How can I be so desperate? Help me.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
  Obviously, giving in to sexual advances from a boss is not an appropriate method of improving one’s performance in the corporate world. The “testing” that he talked about was an attempt to rationalize his illegal behavior. In the United States, his behavior would be considered sexual harassment.Please don’t be so hard on yourself (i.e. how can I be so desperate?). It is human nature to want to be wanted and loved. I think you have great insight into why you feel the way you do. Your past sexual abuse has a lot to do with your feelings. In addition, low self-esteem and feeling unworthy makes you vulnerable to people who might be seeking to take advantage of you.Counseling is the ideal place to deal with these issues. If possible, choose a therapist who specializes in trauma and sexual abuse. Counseling could help you deal with the feelings generated from this event and to develop a healthier sense of self-worth so you will choose the right partner. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 I read a question that was similar to the one I have, but I did not believe it could fully be used for my situation. Both my girlfriend and me are 20 years of age. We have been together since July 2nd 2010, and it is March 28th 2011. We were friends for many years before we started dating but due to both of us moving around we were not able to have a relationship. She is everything I ever wanted in a woman and I am so happy to have her in my life. I had no sexual interactions what so ever before I was with her, she is my first in everything. Unfortunately, I am not her first in many things, if anything at all, and that is very hurtful and distressing to me. When she was growing up her parents neglected and even abused her. She was molested on several occasions, but never by a family member. Her life has not been one of happiness and is full of past pains that plague her to this day. She never felt loved or cared about by anyone, and sought out relationships to fill this void. Her first sexual experience was with a female, they were friends and one night during a sleep over her friend put her hand down my girlfriends pants and began feeling around down there. My girlfriend said she did it back to her friend. She was bisexual for a while and dated a few girls, but never did anything for that kiss them. Though not often she claims. Her first sexual experience with a boyfriend was when she was 14 and the guy she was dating asked her to “touch him”, and so she did. She says she didn’t want to but did it to make him happy. In her next relationship she let him suck on her breasts and finger her, she touched him but while he had pants on so there was no contact with his penis. In her third relationship she also let him finger her and she gave him a hand job as well. In her last relationship she went out with this guy for 2.5 years and she really loved him. He was the first she gave oral sex to, and they did everything together. He fingered her; she gave him many hand jobs and lots of oral sex. She wanted to have sex and so did he, but she brought it up to him. They agreed and she claims that he only penetrated her a little bit before finishing, so she doesn’t believe she lost her virginity. He claims that every time they tried, which both him and her say was 3 times, that they had full intercourse but she swears that after that first time having failed, and the other two times they never got past being naked, none of the times they ever had full intercourse. I don’t know if she’s trying to protect me because she knows how bad it would hurt me if they actually did, or if she really didn’t have full on sex with him. I know her was able to penetrate her at least somewhat so I also have issues with whether she was still a virgin the first time we had sex.<|im_end|>

 One of the things you love about your woman is she is the total sum of her life experiences. Everything about her background—including her experiments — are factors that drew you into the relationship at some level.I would learn to meditate. Mindfulness meditation will help you bring you into the moment — which has the potential to liberate you from the self-torture that comes from rethinking the past. Here is a link to more information about mindfulness.What I can offer you is what I know has worked for some, and that is to cognitively restructure—change your thoughts about your experience.Your girlfriend’s experiments in relationships ultimately led her to move past them to you.This means that the relationship she has with you has been informed by her past. Those relationships were not what she wanted. She wanted something more and better, and found that with you.When you are thinking about the images—it actually takes you away from the intimacy you are having with your girlfriend. Try to bring your focus on her when you are with her rather than on her past which cannot change.If the struggle continues you may want to talk to a counselor to help with some techniques. The find help tab at the top of the page will help.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Long Distance relationship. I went up to see him and he thought I had been cheating on him. Now, he doesn’t trust me. I have never cheated on him. I would never cheat on him or anyone.

This is now my ex boyfriend, but the love of my life and his too, he says, but he can’t get past this. This trust issue happened 5 years. His ex wife cheated on him. This has ruined everything. The happiest times of our lives were with each other. Any suggestions?<|im_end|>

 Thank you for trusting me with your question. I recommend you be bold. Confront your boyfriend with his projection. You said it very clearly here, now it’s time to say it clearly to him. Let him know that because of what his ex-wife did he is interpreting everything as if he’s going to be betrayed again. Explain that it is not fair to you because it means that, in spite of what you do, say, or share with him, his mind interprets it as a betrayal. This leaves you helpless. The pain his wife has caused him in the past is never-ending in his future. Be clear about the fact that this is not yours to fix. Any woman he dates is going to be seen as a cheater because in his mind he can only foresee it happening again. Here’s a link to an excellent article about this kind of trauma.Tell him that it feels miserable to be mistrusted when nothing you’ve done warrants it. I would be very clear about this putting all the responsibility for his perception and struggle in the relationship on him. Don’t mince words.I know these are strong terms. But the bottom line is he either changes his attitude and sees you for who you truly are or there is no need for you to be with him.Finally, offer to go with him to see a couples therapist. This can be both supportive and enlightening for him. This gives him a chance to hear what you have told him from a neutral third party, get support from you by going with him, and give him a chance to see the dynamics he is causing.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I have been married three years ago. We(me & my wife) are from India and belong from different family backgrounds and economic status,she being the best out of the two.The problem started after my marriage when she started disliking my parents because of my mom. Somehow my mom’s behavior did not meet her expectations. She stopped talking to them and wanted me to do the same as well.<|im_end|>

 You are right. For some reason, your wife is very insecure. Asking you to take sides and cutting off communication for real or imagined hurts is manipulative. Asking you to shout at people is asking you to be as immature as she is. She apparently doesn’t understand that she is creating exactly the situation she fears most: Her bahavior is making a gap between you that will be harder and harder to bridge. No one should ever be asked to choose between the people they love.I wonder why your wife feels so threatened by your relationship with your parents. Does she, perhaps, not have an equally close relationship with her own parents? Does she feel that she needs to compete for your love? Since you are from different backgrounds, is it possible that she misunderstands your family’s ways and thinks they are being rude to her when they are only being themselves? Or has something happened in her life that makes her feel so unloved that she needs all of your love and attention to feel like she is getting enough? Does she feel she married beneath her and therefore needs you to reject your family in order to be equal to her?Without more information, I’m afraid I can’t be very helpful. Perhaps you can take a big step back from the situation and analyze what motivates her to be this way. If you can understand her pain, you’ll be able to be more compassionate and you’ll be better able to address her needs. Instead of arguing with her, keep asking her, in the most loving way you can, why she doubts your love. Reassure her you have plenty of love to go around; that loving your family doesn’t diminish your ability to love her.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From a young teen in the U.S.: I hate my family because of my cousin. I have no space. I am forced to be with him all the time everyday. He makes fun of me, calls me names, and is constantly bullying me. My grandma (who I live with) gets me in trouble because I’m supposed to be older than that and not react. my cousin just uses that against me and when finally say something back I’m the one that gets in trouble. When I am with the only friend I am allowed hang out with, my cousin would not leave us alone until I finally snapped and yelled at him.<|im_end|>

It seems to me that this is between your friend and his girlfriend. He must be very in love with her or okay with her behavior (or both) or he wouldn’t be continuing the relationship. If he is confiding in you and expressing doubts, you could suggest that some couple counseling might help the two of them create a more balanced relationship where his needs and preferences would be given the same consideration as hers.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My childhood was pretty rocky; there was lots of moving around, my father was involved in dangerous illegal operations that often put us in traumatizing situations, so once my mother passed it felt like a lot of emotions I had tried really hard to let go of and control came spilling over into my life again. After she died I felt like a very critical part of me died with her. I have a hard time distinguishing friends from foes. I used to be very empathetic but now I feel really detached emotionally from people. I feel like I have a harder time reading them. This has added to my mistrust of people. Recently, I was upset at my boyfriends sister because she blew me off while I was trying to tell her something. She later told me she was sorry and that she was just grumpy from the morning. Later that day I discovered texts between my bf and her talking behind my back. It hurt me deeply because I thought the apology was sincere and now I feel my feelings are disregarded and I can’t go back and talk to him about that.<|im_end|>

 The death of a parent is a monumentally difficult life experience. It’s not something that people simply “get over.”After the loss of your mother, you began to detach emotionally and mistrust people. It was traumatic for you. The lingering effects of that trauma remains an issue.Your main inquiry involves an issue with your boyfriend’s sister. You feel as though she betrayed you. You did not include details about what the text messages said. Without that information, I cannot determine if you are appropriately reacting to what she wrote.Miscommunication is a very common occurrence. Even under the best of circumstances, communication is extremely difficult. You might think that you know what she said but you can’t be certain that she properly communicated the intent of her message.It’s also important to note that texting is a poor form of communication. Texting essentially is a short-form version of communication. When people are texting, they’re typing in words very quickly. They do not have time to fully contemplate what they are communicating.With texting there’s also the issue of auto-correction. Auto-correction is supposed to make texting easier and quicker. Someone may choose to use an auto-corrected word rather than type out, in long form, precisely what they wanted to say. In essence, auto-correction weakens communication.Even if she said what she wanted to say, perfectly, her words are being interpreted by you. You may be making assumptions about what you think she wanted to say. You’ve been struggling with issues of mistrust since the death of your mother and it may be impacting your interpretation of what she wrote.Before you decide to move out of your home, it’s important that you speak to your boyfriend and his sister about the texts. Be honest about how they made you feel and give them an opportunity to explain. It might be a matter miscommunication, simply a big misunderstanding but you won’t know if you don’t ask. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 I’m glad you are thinking carefully about this. Your fiance has been very honest with you about his commitment to his mother’s care. Marriage to him means joining him in that commitment. He is not going to change it.The person you need to be talking to about these issues is your future husband. You say you plan on having children. Does he? How will the two of you handle the expense involved in supporting both his mom and your own growing family? What are his expectations regarding your financial contribution to the family? Do you agree? What are his expectations for your role in his mother’s care? Do you agree?I don’t think you should go ahead with this relationship unless and until you have the answers to those questions. An honest conversation with your fiance will give you the answer you need about whether to go ahead.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I’m 30 and have never experienced the feeling of being embarrassed or shame. I constantly read and see the word (embarrassment) in books or TV, but I have never identified with it. When growing up, I actually thought the feeling of anger (which I experience quite often) and the feeling of embarrassment were one and the same thing. I now realize from my past that in situations were I was supposed to feel embarrassed such as when I was bullied or ridiculed, I only felt anger.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It’s just possible that you are really one of the lucky people who has never done anything to be ashamed of. It does happen.And anger at bullies rather than embarrassment is a healthy response indeed. It’s the bullies who should be feeling shame.It may be that your experience as a victim when you were young taught you that anger was a more helpful response than embarrassment. You therefore learned to transform all embarrassed feelings to anger. That’s only an educated guess. I’d need to know more about you to say more.Since you describe yourself as fully able to experience the full range of other emotions, I’m not worried about you. However, I do think it would be helpful for you to expand your response repertoire to include embarrassment when it is appropriate. A psychiatrist isn’t likely to help you with that these days since their jobs usually require them to limit their sessions to a very short time and to focus on pharmacology. I suggest you instead contact a local licensed psychologist, social worker or mental health counselor to talk it over. They will have the ability to hear your entire story instead of only the 200+ words of your letter.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I binge and purge almost every day but I’m not sure if I’m bulimic. My binges are not always followed by purging and my purging in not always preceded by binging. Sometimes I like the full feeling. Sometimes I’m just searching for the feeling of relief I get when I vomit. I don’t think I’m preoccupied with my weight. Also, I’m genuinely overweight so afraid to discuss this with my psychiatrist in case he thinks I’m making it up.<|im_end|>

 Whether or not you have a specific eating disorder can only be determined by an in-person, mental health evaluation. Binging and purging is unhealthy and most often requires professional mental health treatment.You are correct about binging and purging damaging your body. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of all mental health disorders. Eating disorders can cause severe malnutrition and many sufferers die from heart failure or organ damage.You should not be ashamed to discuss these issues with your psychiatrist. Without your input and honesty, your psychiatrist cannot properly treat your condition. Your silence is severely hindering your care.Seeing a psychiatrist might not be enough for you. The most effective treatments involve both medication and therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is particularly helpful for the treatment of eating disorders. CBT can help you to identify and alter the irrational thought patterns that may be underlying your self-harm activities. Studies consistently show that therapy for eating disorders is quite effective.I would strongly urge you to discuss these issues with your psychiatrist. Ask him or her for a referral to a therapist. Do not continue to keep this problem a secret because you may be doing irreversible damage to your body. There is no reason for you to continue to suffer with problems that are highly treatable.

 From the U.S.: Me and my boyfriend have been dating for about 10 months. We live two and a half hours away from each other until I graduate from college in May, but we still see each other every weekend and I stay with him whenever I have breaks. He is an amazing guy who obviously loves and cares about me a lot. Even though I know this, I will still find reasons to get upset, sometimes creating problems out of thin air.<|im_end|>

 I’m very glad you wrote. Recognizing a problem is the first step toward fixing it. It would be a shame to end a very promising relationship like this one because you lose it for unknown reasons.If this happened only when you are drinking, the answer would be simple. Stop drinking. Not everyone can handle alcohol. Some people are nasty when they drink too much. You may be one of them. But you say this also happens when you are sober. That suggests a more fundamental issue.My only guess is that you are “testing” your boyfriend with your tantrums. If he puts up with this behavior, you may believe that it means he loves you and won’t leave. But as you point out, you may very well create the very situation you fear. No matter how much he cares for you, your boyfriend may understandably decide your tantrums are too much for him.I suggest you make an appointment with a therapist to talk this over. If you are “testing”, it is probably grounded in some past experience where you felt betrayed or left. With the help of a counselor, you can deal with the insecurity and learn to trust again.I hope you will follow through and work on this. Your boyfriend deserves better. You deserve to feel more secure in love.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I knew something was wrong for years, but I figured I was just complaining — other people need help more than I do. Recently, my father was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. After he was diagnosed and started to take medicine, he sat me down and told me it was alright for me to get help too, whenever I felt it necessary. He had noticed much of the same behavior in me — we think and do so much alike that it is almost scary. I do notice cycles of I’m ok, I’m normal, I feel great. In these times, I can stay up as late as I want, I can start project after project, and my brain is moving so fast that when I try to explain, I just can’t. I say things I wouldn’t normally say, things no socially expectable. I do crazy embarrassing things and don’t feel them. Then I notice periods where I can’t mustard the strength to get out of bed. Everything I see makes me cry and feel like there is nothing in the world that is ok or good. During these periods, I often sleep a lot. The other day I slept 10 hours after taking a 2 and a half hour nap. Things like that. Is there something actually wrong with my head? Or am I just complaining? Is going to get help worth it? Or will they tell me to suck it up? Advice?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Let me answer your questions directly. You are not a complainer. Yes, it is worth seeking help. No, you will not be told to “suck it up.”I have had many bipolar clients who have described their symptoms with nearly the identical language that you have used. It doesn’t mean that you are bipolar, but your symptoms are similar. It is enough to suspect bipolar but not enough to diagnose bipolar. You need an in-person evaluation by a clinician to receive a diagnosis.You might erroneously believe that you should be able to solve your own problems. Unfortunately, it is this kind of “pull yourself up by your bootstraps mentality” that prevents many people from seeking psychological help.If you broke your leg, I highly doubt that you would call yourself a complainer or believe that you need to “suck it up.” Instead you would probably go straight to the emergency room where you would be treated by experts who know how to fix broken bones.We should take that same approach when it comes to psychological problems. When there’s a problem, you should see an expert.Most people wouldn’t hesitate to see a specialist for broken bones yet many are reluctant to consult a specialist for psychological problems. It makes them feel weak and people don’t like to feel weak.Your father is good role model for you. He is anything but weak. He sought help and is now doing better and wants the same for you. You should follow his lead.He suggested that you might have bipolar disorder. He might be correct, but he is not trained to give mental health diagnoses. That’s why you need to consult a mental health professional. He or she can determine what might be wrong and most importantly, develop a treatment plan that specifically addresses your symptoms.I hope that you will take your father’s advice and seek help. Your symptoms are clearly degrading your life. Good treatments exist for virtually all mental health disorders. Utilize the help that is available. I wish you and your father the best of luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I have a 9 year old boy and a 6 year old girl. All my life I have had terrible, terrible ways of dealing with frustrations large and small. A good example: if anything makes me angry–trivial or truly important, I might put on a wild, embarrassing, very inappropriate, and very unhealthy display of rage. I never physically attack another person, but I’ll start hitting my own head–hard, repeatedly, with both hands–sometimes open hands, sometimes fists. Not in a “stupid me!” kind of gesture like slapping one’s forehead–these flailings have no intended expressive meaning. They’re the exact same as an angry guy punching a wall or a piece of furniture. (Actually I do that plenty too–usually if I’m hitting myself, it’s because there’s nothing else nearby that’s “safe” to hit–safe for the thing itself, or safe for my hands.)<|im_end|>

  It’s good that you’re seeking help. It shows that you’re open to change. With the right help, you can change your behavior.You mentioned medication but not counseling. Counseling could be the missing component in your treatment program. Not having tried counseling could be why you’re not seeing an improvement. Cognitive behavioral therapy is an effective treatment for anger problems, as are certain types of targeted anger management therapies. Medication could help, but it may not be enough. You should try counseling.You might also try family counseling to address the problems with your children. Clearly you are influencing their behavior. Your behavior has become their behavior. Family therapy can be quite effective in changing these dynamics and behaviors. It could help a great deal.Regarding your specific question about children exposed to traumatic experiences, there are several effective treatments. Two models that have been shown to work include: Child-Parent Psychotherapy and Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Finding clinicians who specialize in these specific types of therapy might be difficult. Generally speaking, choose a mental health professional who has demonstrated success in treating children who have experienced trauma. Ask your psychiatrist for a referral or click the “Find Help” tab at the top of this page to locate a therapist in your community.When trying to pick a therapist I always advise calling at least 5 to 10. Speak to them on the phone about the problems with which you would like help. Ask questions about their success rates and how they’ve helped other people with similar problems. Choose the one with whom you best connect with, over the phone, and meet him or her in person for a more in-depth discussion. This will help you find the right therapist for you and/or your children. Good luck and please take care.<|im_end|>"

I’m very glad you wrote. This is a difficult way to live. As much as you say you hate change, you do need to change how you think and feel.Normally, I would refer anyone who is suffering physical pains to their physician. In your case, the pain changes location day to day. That suggests that the “pain” is a way that your body is telling you that something is wrong but that it might not be physical. I’m guessing the body pains are like a “smoke detector” going off, telling you that you are in deep psychological pain that needs to be treated. You should have an exam by a physician just in case there is something medically amiss — just to be on the safe side.I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of only a letter. But your description of your thoughts and feelings does suggest depression and anxiety. Please make an appointment with a mental health professional for an evaluation. Self-diagnosis may be a place to start but once you label yourself, what do you do next? For that you need the expertise of a professional. A counselor will not only evaluate you for a diagnosis but will also make suggestions for what you can do to feel better.Meanwhile, you say you can’t help it that you have low self esteem but that simply isn’t true. Self esteem isn’t something you have or you don’t. It’s a term that describes how people feel about themselves at the time. A positive self esteem can be built by interrupting negative thinking and setting positive thinking in motion. The way to do that is to start doing things that you believe are helpful to others. Doing good is what leads to feeling good. If you wait to feel good before you do good, it won’t work. It goes the other way around. I know. I researched this and wrote a book about it: Unlocking the Secrets of Self-Esteem: A Guide to Building Confidence and Connection One Step at a Time.You made a very important first step toward feeling better by writing to us here. I urge you to take the next step and to make those appointments with a physician and counselor. You don’t have to live with these feelings. With the help and support of professionals — and with commitment on your part to work on it, you can again feel good about yourself and have friends.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I don’t think you are being overly sensitive. You had a tough beginning. You had to leave your parents at age 2 and then leave the relatives at age 4. As a result, it could be that you developed a distrust of attaching to anyone. On top of that, your mother has had a hard time and hasn’t always been warm or supportive. Hitting and slapping is not a way to make a child feel safe. It’s simply not okay.It makes sense that you are cautious about getting close but it is definitely something to work on. Not everyone you befriend or love is going to leave you. In fact, acting like someone will leave might make them do just that. We do tend to get what we expect.If you can’t let yourself develop close relationships, I do suggest that you make an appointment with a mental health counselor who can help you both understand yourself better and can guide you as you work on being more comfortable in close relationships.I’m very glad you wrote now, when you are 14, instead of waiting. Waiting on issues like this one tends to make it more difficult to fix. Getting into some therapy now will help you have a much happier social life in school and will set you on a more positive course for relationships in your future.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I’m not really sure how to explain this in a way you will understand. but here goes. I’m 17years old and ever sinse 8Th grade iv had an issue with cutting and scratching myself when i get angry and its mostly because my mom has yelled at me or gotten after me for something. because she always says that i give her attitude. but honestly i dont see how i have attitude because i dont throw a fit or anything like that. and there have been times where i figured why should i even live that nothing i ever do is good enough. i mostly feel like a failure sometimes. and iv tried to stop cutting. i can go for months but then start up again. and i get really anger at times where i just want to beat something. and i dont believe its healthy but my mom believes that theres nothing wrong with me. but i think there is. i dont know what to do, and the weird thing is. is when i was little and my mom would get after me id go to my room and bite myself or id say i dont deserve to live. Ive been to 2 counselor people and they never tested me for anything. the first one was more concerned on a certain person i couldn’t be around and the 2nd one was when i overdosed in 2009 and all he did was asked if i saw ghost or if i could predict the future and told me about a book i could read. and they never tested me for any signs of depression and stuff like that. I’m so lost. i hope you can help.<|im_end|>

 You are correct. Engaging in self-harm is not healthy. You seem to engage in this behavior when you become upset or angry. Below are three possible explanations for why you self-harm.I have limited information about your history. From what you have revealed, you may have depression. Cutting is a not a symptom of depression but there is often a link between the two. The reason an individual engages in cutting behavior may be related to a negative self-image. Having a negative self-image is often indicative of depression. In addition, you mentioned that you overdosed in 2009. I am assuming that the overdose was an attempt to end your life or a cry for help. Suicidal ideation and a history of suicide attempts are often associated with depression.The best way to know with certainty if depression is an accurate diagnosis is to be evaluated by a mental health professional. You mentioned that you have been to several. These visits did not help you but you should not give up on the idea of counseling. Continue to search for a mental health professional who you feel comfortable with and who can provide you with the best possible treatment.Despite the fact that you may have depression I find your situation very encouraging. Even though your mother has not responded to your psychological needs in a satisfactory way, she supports your desire to attend treatment. There are many adolescents who do not have access to mental health treatment because their parents would never allow it. In this sense, you are very fortunate.Don’t give up hope and please continue to search for a mental health professional who you like and trust. Finding the right therapist can make all the difference in your life. In the meantime, you should educate yourself about cutting and depression. I’m not suggesting that books are a cure but knowledge is empowering. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I’m diagnosed as Bipolar II with Psychotic Features and I have been hearing voices/seeing/feeling things lately but today things got a little worse than they’ve been. I had this strong mental “movie” that I couldn’t control playing in my mind of a person holding my arm, about to stab me with a knife and I was afraid that it was real. A small part of me knew it wasn’t but another part of me was still scared as if it were reality. A little while after that, I saw an image in my mind of the grim reaper standing behind me, about to slit my throat or strangle me with a wire. It felt like it was real and I could kind of sense that it was real even though I knew deep down that it wasn’t. I experienced these types of “episodes” before. So my question is, does this count as psychosis or is it something entirely different?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Generally speaking, psychosis is a generic term used to describe a state of mind in which there is a break with reality. Symptoms of psychosis can include hallucinations and delusions. During a break with reality, an individual is unable to tell the difference between what is real and what is not real.You are specifically inquiring about the “mental movie” playing in your mind. At times, you believe it is real, but you eventually come to realize that it is not real. The question becomes: will there come a time when you are no longer able to make that distinction? This is the concern.The “mental movie” symptom is concerning, especially given your history of psychotic symptoms. I would characterize it as being abnormal, but without conducting a thorough psychosocial, in-person interview I cannot determine if it rises to the level of psychosis.My recommendation is to contact your treating mental health professionals and make them aware of your concerns. They can evaluate this situation and determine if intervention is necessary. When it comes to psychosis, it’s best to be proactive. Intervention, particularly medication, could prevent the development of a full-scale psychotic episode. This has been proven time and time again. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I’m a person with various failed friendships, usually i get very close to someone but the friendship only last for like a year, and i always end up thinking that i’m kinda replaceable because for the other person is easier to find new friends. In my last year of college i found a couple of friends that i’m very close with, even when we no longer see each other every day and work in different places we have a very good friendship. The problem is that i’m afraid to lose them, in my line of work there’s not much chance to meet new people and i fear i won’t be able to find new friends if i lose them. When i make a mistake, or do something that affects them, or could make the angry, i freak out, even when they tell me that it is ok i can’t stop thinking that we’ll drift apart. I know that i did nothing so bad and i would forgive them if things where the opposite, but i can’t stop thinking that i messed up, it doesn’t matter how much i want to stop, i can’t. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to be this anxious all the time.<|im_end|>

 You categorize your past friendships as being failures but maybe that’s not the case. I am also wondering if you are giving those “friendships” more weight than they deserved.There’s an important difference between acquaintances and friends. Acquaintances are often the people we befriend at work or at school. These relationships tend not to be very deep and often naturally end when would we no longer work at the same establishment or attend the same school. Almost everyone has these types of relationships at some point in their lives.Friendships are deeper and more serious than acquaintance-type relationships. This may sound counterintuitive but among psychologically healthy people, it’s normal to have a rather small circle of friends. Because these relationships develop over time and require a great deal of energy and effort, they tend to be fewer in number.Your ability to have healthy interpersonal relationships might be less of a problem than the fear you have about losing them. Fear seems to be at the heart of the issue. I would need more information about the nature of your friendships, both current and in the past, to know what’s wrong.Counseling is the ideal place to address these issues. Counselors provide objective advice and guidance about correcting life problems. They specialize in relationship issues. Ask your primary care physician for referral to a counselor in your community. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I know I have OCD, GAD, depression, and an eating disorder and I am on 30mg of prozac which has helped a bit. However, I noticed a few changes in my behavior and im not quite sure what to make of them and i had to stop seeing my therapist, Im seeing a new one soon, but im supposed to discuss gender identity problems so i dont think that is the right place to discuss this. Basically im very paranoid and at first it seemed to all be related to social anxiety like i would convince myself they all hated me and would delete all my social media and hate them for supposedly hating me (for something as silly as not answering a text) but i got in trouble so im fairly isolated now and only have myself to talk to. But when im driving im always looking to see whos behind me and what they might be thinking and if theyre following me and ill go 40 in a 25 just to get away from someone and im overly suspicious something is up and theyre followng me or thinking bad things of me somehow.I also have depersonalization and derealization issues and when it gets bad i convince myself that the reality im trapped in doesnt matter anyways and that i should just focus on the reality i create for myself in my head. Im also more religious lately? Ive always been agnostic but now I love Jesus a lot and bought a crucifix to hang on my wall from a thrift shop which isnt an issue but im just worried because my grandpa and uncle were both schizophrenic and im 17 and these are supposed to be early warning signs but i dont want to jump to conclusions of course. I dont know. I just feel really weird and life seems very strange to me.<|im_end|>

 Being between therapists is likely contributing to your anxiety. You also mentioned that your Prozac has “helped a bit.” “A bit” is small. It would suggest that your symptoms are not well controlled. These two factors are likely contributing to your symptoms.Another consideration is that the symptoms you referred to as paranoia might actually be symptoms of anxiety. People with anxiety disorders tend to fear extreme, irrational and unlikely outcomes. It is fairly common for people with anxiety disorders to believe that they are developing schizophrenia.Once you begin therapy, you might find that your symptoms dissipate. It is also possible that you need a medication change. Your medication should be helping you more than “a bit.” Once you begin counseling again and have your medication adjusted, your symptoms might improve.Having two family members with schizophrenia increases your probability of developing schizophrenia but only slightly. There is a strong genetic component to schizophrenia but environmental and psychosocial factors also play a strong role.You are still very young. At 17, your brain and identity are still in development. The teenage years are a turbulent time. Carefully monitor and record your symptoms and should you decide to see a therapist, sharing this information would be very helpful. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year now, we usually communicate our feelings and are very respectful of each other. In May, my bf started talking to a girl who had previously had feelings for before we started dating, because he felt as if he left her behind without clearing things up. I didn’t think much of it until he gave her a ride home and let her stay at his house while she was locked out of hers. I know he wasn’t cheating because his mom and sister were in the kitchen with them, but this was the first time he didn’t let me know what was going on. I later found out that for a little over a week he had been saying he was “going to sleep” and would hang up only to go FaceTime this girl and talk to her for hours after 11pm. He wasn’t even honest with everything at first until I questioned why he had deleted their conversation from his phone and I saw the facetimes in his call log. It took him about an hour to finally tell me everything that happened, I was considering breaking up since I had felt so betrayed. He knew he was supposed to be honest and never lie again, but he did it again about two weeks ago. He told me he was texting a friend of mine about their common interest in music and I was okay and happy he was honest. I hung up with him around 2am and told him to sleep soon because we had a date planned for early the next morning. I hung out with that friend a couple days later and she told me that they had stayed up until 4am texting and that he told her not to tell me. I confronted him, he admitted and said he was planning on telling me that night. He had once again deleted their conversation and I had to get it from her, btw she didn’t send me the important parts so I am no longer friends with her. And once again he has lied, again nothing huge, but he said he would send me pics of his food while on vaca. He has been gone a week and nothing, I keep pestering him for them and he said he sent one of his dessert. I knew something was shady so I confronted him and told him not to lie, but he proceeded to and was going to fake the whole thing FOR A PICTURE. I don’t know what to do because he hasn’t stopped, how will I know he really will when he says so if it hasn’t been true so far. I don’t want to lose our relationship, but I have told him I am not going to date someone who won’t stop lying to me.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 There’s a famous quote that might be helpful in your situation: “when people show you who they are, believe them the first time.” You said that you don’t want to date someone who lies, but you are doing just that. You have caught him lying a number of times. He is showing you his character. He lies about small and big things. People who are willing to lie about small things are most certainly willing to lie about bigger things. If you don’t want to date someone who lies, then consider ending the relationship.Try to avoid making the same mistake that many people make, which is trying to change their partner. People are who they are and you cannot mold them into someone you want them to be. You cannot control another person’s behavior. You can only react to it.Dating is about getting to know someone to see if they are a match for you. When you learn that they are not a match, then it is time to move on. The majority of people who you will date will not be a match. That is the nature of dating. It is as true for you as it is for everyone else. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: My boyfriend has multiple girls online that he communicates with. He tells them he loves them and they share naked pictures with each other. He also calls them on the phone and texts them he says it means nothing because they live abroad. I recently found out that he has been seeing this local girl the whole time we have been together about 1.5 years but he says they are just friends and are no longer romantically involved, but he refuses me to meet her. He tells me these relationships don’t mean anything and I am ruining our relationship and that he wants us to get married … I insisted he take a class at the church that offers help on dealing with sexual temptation. He has started these classes but he has not ended his online relationships … is he addicted to this behavior? Can he change? Should I even bother on giving him a chance?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 The short answer to your question is “no.” You probably shouldn’t give him more chances. You two are in your 40s, so this is probably a long-established pattern of behavior for him. Although you have been together for a year and a half, your boyfriend isn’t willing to become a faithful partner. He has lied to you and refuses to let you meet his so-called “friends.” I suspect that he is going through the motions at the class in order to keep you in his stable of relationships. He has no intention of really changing.One of my teachers used to say, “Two relationships are fewer than one.” What he meant is that by having many relationships, a person doesn’t have to take the emotional risk that is involved by becoming a loving and exclusive partner. I don’t have the information needed to help you understand why your boyfriend needs to protect himself this way. I do know that when someone has a long history of his kind of behavior it takes a great deal of motivation and often intense therapy to change it.I’m sure there is something sweet about him since you (and the other women in his life) do care for him. But I think you are setting yourself up for more hurt if you try to make a marriage with this man.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I am wasting time that i could be adventuring life and seeing the world but im stuck in a ugly office 8 hours a day. im doing different things each week and trying to get out of my comfort zone everyday.

 It sounds to me that the job is the problem. Instead of thinking about killing yourself, why not consider a significant job change? It might take time. It might take retooling. It might take some schooling. But setting a goal for a satisfying career and starting to work on it will be more helpful to your general emotional state than staying stuck and annoyed.We spend at least a third of our life at work. That’s a lot of time to spend being bored and angry. Use your off-work time to start positioning yourself for a job that will let you be creative and see the world.Yes, such jobs are out there. Meanwhile, use whatever vacation time you have to go somewhere, anywhere, that is different and adventuresome. Only you can make choices that will leave you free of regrets. If you can’t get yourself motivated to help yourself, please consider seeing a therapist to help you kickstart a new direction.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I’m 36,married 7 years but have been with my huband 12 years.We’ve a great ‘practical’ marriage-we’re great at organising holidays & doing everyday chores,etc, but haven’t had sex in years.We have 1 friend in our town,where we’ve been living for 7 years.My husband never asks anyone to our house or organises nights out.If we do go out it’s because I organise it.Usually,we go out for dinner & a few drinks but he would never initiate conversation with anyone,so it’s been impossible to make friends since I’ve met him.If left on his own,he either watches tv or plays computer games.I’ve asked him to turn them off but he won’t.I’d love him to organise a ‘date night’ but that won’t happen.I’d love him to be more sociable.He’s quite happy just to sit in every night,just the 2 of us.I want to meet people & make friends but he’s not interested.I’ve joined us to social groups.This worked briefly-he went & chatted to people but didn’t take their numbers or keep in touch with them.I don’t know what to do.I think of leaving him but I don’t want to.Where do I start to change our life?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Not everyone is sociable. You married someone who is satisfied to have one friend – you. To his credit, he did go and chat with people when you organized the event. That suggests that he can at least tolerate social events even though he doesn’t seek them out. All couples divide up the business of being a couple. It looks to me like in this marriage you will always be the social director.It is not your husband’s fault that you only have 1 friend after 7 years in your community. Nothing is stopping you from making a wonderful circle of friends. I’m sure you’ll find that there are other women with equally reclusive husbands. Every now and then they may agree to get together with other couples but they’re just as happy at home. Meanwhile, you and the women can get together to enjoy each other’s company as often as you like. Join a book club. Get involved in an organization. Volunteer where you’ll find others who share your interests. Start inviting people for tea or to go to events and attractions. Make your life what you want it to be.As for the lack of sex: You didn’t give me enough information for me to make any suggestions. I do wonder if it’s more of the same, with you wanting him to want it and so not making the first move. If he’s able when you start it, I hope you’ll just let yourself enjoy the closeness and not deprive yourself of the pleasure of intimacy because you had to be the initiator.If you love this man and want to stay with him, stop focusing on what he should do and instead get going on what you can do to make your life more satisfying.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I’m very, very sad and mad that your girlfriend has been so badly mistreated. But at this point, your problem isn’t with the various men who have hurt her or had sex with her. Your problem is that your girlfriend keeps putting herself in situations where she will be victimized and then possibly be rejected by you, the one guy who truly cares for her. This isn’t uncommon: Sometimes when women have been sexually abused, they feel so bad about themselves, they think that somehow they deserved it. Their self-esteem is so low, they don’t stand up for themselves or leave situations where they can be hurt again. Other victims develop the idea that there are only two ways to be in a sexual relationship: Either the victim or the victimizer. They never want to be an abuser, so they repeatedly get into relationships where they will be the victim. As hard as it may be to understand, all of these types of problems are mistaken attempts to process the original abuse or rape.You can’t do anything about what guys did to her but you can help your girlfriend. She needs to see a therapist who specializes in trauma work. Encourage her to make an appointment and get started in therapy. Until she gets the help she needs, she will probably continue to do self-destructive things to test your love — like sleeping with your former best friend. No one can blame you if you can’t stay in such a relationship. But if she does do her therapeutic work, she will be able to put the sad history where it belongs – in the past — and she’ll be able to see all the worthwhile things about her that you see.I wish you both well. <|im_end|>"

I was have been diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety disorder. I have this voice in my head that talks to me and tells me what to do. Sometimes it says things like “if you don’t go do this you’ll die” other times it tells me to cut or to kill myself. It tells me I’m worthless and a failure. I also spend a lot of my time talking to myself and the voice in my head. It’s not an external voice, I’m not hearing it, I know it’s in my head. I asked my psychology teacher and she said that may be schizophrenia. I am afraid to ask anyone else because people think I’m crazy. I also don’t have the social skills to even approach anybody. I believe I may have Asperger’s syndrome as well because I have absolutely no social skills whatsoever and people think I’m rude because of it and my girlfriend has pointed out that I have these weird obsessions. Do you have any advice for me? <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
A: Yes, I have some advice for you … go get some professional help.  Either go back to the person who diagnosed you with ADHD and an anxiety disorder or ask your parents to take you to someone else. Hearing voices, especially ones that tell you to do things, is not normal and is not typically part of the diagnoses you list here.   Auditory hallucinations can be linked to several things, including schizophrenia, severe depression, bipolar disorder and some types of dissociative disorders. There are also some medical conditions that can cause hallucinations. Getting an accurate diagnosis from a mental health professional now, while you are still young, could be crucial in avoiding more severe problems later. Furthermore, you don’t have to have good social skills to participate in therapy. In fact, therapy can help you improve your social skills, which will help you interact more effectively in your personal relationships. Don’t worry about being “crazy” or about what anyone thinks. No one besides you and your parents need to know about  your treatment, but please talk to your parents soon about getting professional help. You can also talk with your school counselor or nurse, or your family physician, to get an appropriate referral. I hope things get better for you soon.All the best,<|im_end|>"

 I’m so. so sorry that you feel this way. But your problem is not your body. Your problem is a low self-esteem. You don’t like yourself so you won’t let other people like you either.There are several American actors and actresses who are overweight and not leading man/woman beautiful. None the less, they are stars because they are friendly, engaging people. You could do the same. But at this point, you are so discouraged, you don’t believe it.I don’t usually recommend my own book on this site but in your case I think it might be helpful. The title is Unlocking the Secrets of Self-Esteem. It’s a workbook that focuses on practical strategies for improving self-esteem.It might also be helpful to see a counselor for some support and encouragement as you work to make changes in your self-image and your health.That’s not to ignore the physical issues. You do need to follow up on treatment for the acne. I hope you are seeing a dermatologist for advice. Some strategic use of make-up might also help you feel better about your appearance. Exercise is not enough to control weight. I suggest you see an nutritionist to develop a plan.You deserve treatment, not self-hatred. Please follow through and see the professionals who can give you the guidance you need.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Ok, side note: I have depression and anxiety and take St John Wort’s. I was watching a show about a man who killed his wife just because he was sick of her and I got an image of killing my little brother, I shook it off and went to bed as per normal, the next night I got the urge and image of strangling my little brother I thought to myself “nah, I’m too lazy” a few nights later I was watching another show and this normal 16 year old killed a boy, with no reason, at dinner we were talking about how if a few of us were murdered the rest of the family would be suspects of interest, I stopped eating went upstairs and threw up everything (I have panic attacks that involve throwing up and hyperventilating) I thought about it for all of my holidays (I threw up a lot) so eventually I stopped throwing up, I suppose I got used to the thoughts, I stopped going near silas, horror movies made me feel sick, whenever I heard about a murder I check to see that they were on drugs or crazy, to check that normal people don’t kill people, but during the school holidays I became very bored and with this thought always in my mind it’s all that I thought about, I stopped wanting things (a husband, a future, to be a midwife) and I started feeling emotionally numb and thinking if my dad died of a heart attack right now, I don’t think id cry, I don’t think I love anyone, I started getting agitated really easily. I also started getting really philosophical and thinking things like “the one bag of chips in my pantry isn’t important, yet they change my future”. I still can’t stop feeling numb or being philosophical. I often question why I do anything, I have no energy, nor motivation to do anything, I’m never hungry, I just feel weird and I always have a headache. I enjoy the thought of jail, I don’t know why but I do, I think it could be because I’m deadly afraid of change it scares me, so jail = no change, schedule, but I don’t know. As if been going to school I’ve been thinking about it less, but on the bus I made myself think about it, I’m not sure if it because I’m afraid that if I stop thinking about it will forget about it and If I forget about it when I’m older I remember and kill someone, or if I don’t actual want to get rid of the thought because I want to actually kill someone. I haven’t imagined killing someone, I’m terrified that if I let myself do that I might enjoy it and want to do it. I had a random thought about “what if I want to be a serial killer and kill people” and it gave me a little fright and I nearly had a panic attack. I feel different than everyone else, I look at people and think “you don’t have these thoughts, you’re normal; you don’t consider killing people do you?” I was going to tell my mum but on the way to her room I thought “I don’t want to get better” and decided I don’t want to get help. Maybe I want to be a psycho; I nearly had a panic attack. I ask myself what killing someone would do for me. I don’t want power or money or anything like that. Before the Christmas break I was more concerned with how others felt then I was for my own feelings, I’m not violent, I was never abused, I live in a nice home, I’ve never done drugs/ alcohol. I used to want to move out but no I don’t in fear that when I’m older I’ll kill someone, I don’t want to be a midwife in fear ill want to kill someone when older. At school I look at people and think “bet they haven’t thought about this, I want to be like them, normal”. I usually have a lot of empathy for people, but now a days I am very short tempered and don’t even want help with my thoughts, sometimes I just can’t be bothered to try. Psychos think they are better than everyone else, maybe that’s what I think, and maybe I am in early stages of becoming a serial killer / killer. I often look up and read ocd hurt stories to make sure its “normal” but whenever I do something bad (sneak food, lie,) I question whether or not it’s because I’m slowly becoming a psycho. I don’t enjoy anything anymore; I want to sleep, because when I’m sleeping I don’t have these thoughts. I didn’t think about it a lot yesterday (don’t know why) and I felt kinda normal, as if I was kind of back to old me/normal me. When I think of the future I feel weird, I just see myself thinking these thoughts and living alone. I just want to know how to tell my mum without worrying her(she knows about the depression and anxiety) and I want to know what this is. Im scared that I want to do this. Thank you for your time.

 Thank you for writing in with your question. It sounds like you are in a lot of pain so I’m glad that you are reaching out for help. The important thing is not how you ask for help, just that you do. If you don’t want to worry your mother with all the details right now you don’t have to, but you do need to let her know that your depression and anxiety are getting worse and that you want to see a professional. St. John’s Wort can be very helpful for mild depression but your symptoms are beyond that at this point. I would suggest that you see both a psychiatrist and a therapist.You have obviously done some reading about Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and fears of harming another person. On one hand educating yourself can be very helpful, but on the other, it can fuel anxiety and obsession in someone struggling with these issues. Most people that fear hurting someone else never actually do, but you ARE hurting yourself by suffering in silence. You took the first step by writing in to this forum, now it’s time to take the next step and get treatment… and stop watching crime shows.All the best,<|im_end|>"

 My sister has self-diagnosed and is using that to get her way. She has started seeing a therapist, but all she does is use what the therapist says to again get her way.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I do not know what is wrong with your sister, but one thing is certain. She doesn’t realize that whatever the therapist is saying to her is equally true for others in the household. Of course she is entitled to an opinion, but so are you. The difficulty is with your sister’s interpretation, not the advice she is getting. Think about it. She misinterprets everyone and everything in the home and twists it to her advantage. Doesn’t it make sense she will simply do the same with information she gets from the therapist? She is the cause of the turmoil in her life, not anyone else. But to get her to understand that may take a long time, if ever.I would recommend two things. First, each time she does something “off” and uses her self-aggrandized interpretation, be clear with her that you have the same rights, and don’t see it the same way, and that you have as much right to your opinion /perspective as she does. Do not let her bully you into anything. Confront her at every turn, every event, and every inappropriate comment. Reclaim your personal power with her. Don’t let her pathology usurp your individuality.It is also time for you to develop a personal plan to move out of the house. It might take a year, but you need a concrete plan for moving out and on with your life.You indicated you were a personal trainer. What would you suggest to a client who wanted to be healthy, but everyone they lived with smoked in the house every day and they were complaining that their clothes and hair smelled bad and they had started developing a cough? You would encourage them not to allow smoke to be blown in their face, but to make plans to live somewhere else. No matter how healthy you are, if you go back into that kind of environment it isn’t going to be okay. This is the emotional equivalent.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

 I’m very, very sorry that your life has had such a downturn in the past few years. I’m sure it feels relentless. I’m sure it’s discouraging. But you are an intelligent, educated woman. You are also a therapist so you have a skill set you can bring to bear on your own problems. Do consider what you would say to a client like yourself who has had terrible luck and is on the edge of giving up. I trust that you would find whatever core of resilience is present and build from there.If you were working with me, we would take a hard look at how your physical illness is contributing to how you are feeling mentally. Those diagnoses need to be addressed for you to have the energy to keep on keepin’ on. Your therapy can help support your efforts to take care of yourself despite how bad you feel.Have you been honest with your therapist? It seems to me that your only goal is to get well enough to have goals — which is a worthy goal.SMART goals are simply a formula to help people think about what is possible and achievable. Don’t let a format get in the way of good thinking. If coming up with goals is what is required to keep your therapy, I’m sure you are creative and intelligent enough to come up with something.How about: S: I want to gather more information about my various medical diagnoses and to develop a treatment plan. Over the next 6 months, I will make and attend appointments with a neurologist for the skull lesions as well as specialists who can give me more information about chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia. I will also see a nutritionist. M: I will make a record of appointments and findings and will write about my concerns and reflections to discuss in therapy. A: In order to stay on track, I will need the support of my therapist. But I do think it is a realistic goal. R: The result of this goal is a more complete understanding of my condition and a focused direction for treatments. T: By December 1, I will accomplish this information gathering and will have worked with my therapist to develop a comprehensive treatment plan.That’s just an example, not a recommendation. I hope you can come up with something that feels right for you.Meanwhile, I suggest you consider getting into group therapy in addition to the individual therapy. You need more support. If the idea of joining anything is daunting, at least consider joining one of the forums here at PsychCentral. People from all over the world provide each other with information and support.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hi, a 12 yo old boy in my family which I’m quite fond of is showing more than normal affection towards me. More than normal because I’m not his father, but somehow I think he sees me as such. His parents divorced when he was 4 or 5 and his father was very violent towards the boy.  As an outsider I was/am unable to intervene, but I saw what I saw. As a consequence (I think) he is currently still suckling his thumb and is constantly seeking physical affection. Hugs, touches, fingers in the hair of people, etc. He tries to do it with many people, mainly men, but they seem to be not too happy with it.  Me on the other hand I know his history and I let him do.  I know he needs kindness and tenderness. As a result he is overly fond of me.  Lately over a 2 week period him amd his family where on holiday in my region. We saw each other every day.  He didn´t leave my side and followed me everywhere, even though his family was right there with him and are very kind. At the end of the 2weeks he was reluctant to go home and was crying, even angry.  I told him he can talk to me and ask me anything anytime when s-thing is bothering him.  I love him as my own son and I treat him the same as my own son. He says he would like me to be his father, although his mother since some years now has a new, kind and loving partner (with a boy & daughter of his own).<|im_end|>

 Thank you for sharing your concerns about this young man. Experiencing trauma in early childhood can dramatically affect one’s ability to form healthy attachment to others, especially if the abuse comes at the hands of someone who is supposed to love and protect you. Sometimes the person may have difficulty showing affection and developing a bond with someone else and sometimes it’s just the opposite and they attach too easily and demonstrate poor boundaries. This could very well be the case for this young man. At the extremes it can lead to a diagnosis of Reactive Attachment Disorder or Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder.The fact that you have been a stable and supportive male role model in this boy’s life is wonderful and it will increase his chances of knowing that he is worthy and lovable. Acting like a father figure for him is a positive thing as well. It may take him time to connect and bond with his new stepfather — and it may help even more if you encourage their relationship. But, I also agree that his overly affectionate behavior toward adult men could be misinterpreted by some and could put him at risk. I encourage you to speak to his mother about getting him into therapy now that he is older. It would be an ideal place for him to work through his abuse and learn appropriate boundaries.Finally, since he exhibits a strong connection with you, you have the ability positively influence him. You can speak to him about good touch and bad touch, learning who it is safe to trust vs who to be cautious with, etc. But, guiding him is not your sole responsibility either. Let the professionals help.All the best,<|im_end|>"

 Love isn’t always wise. I’m sorry you are in such a painful situation. I’m sure it feels both scary and terrible to realize this man isn’t who you thought he was. But let’s be honest. He has not been a great dad to your daughter. He is not loving her mother. He is not committed to making the kind of family she needs to grow strong. He is not committed to putting his responsibilities as a father above his desires to be a man about town. He’s lying. You’ve let the situation turn you into a snoop.You and your daughter deserve better. Your boyfriend may be able to avoid growing up but you can’t. You may be only 20 but you have a daughter to raise now. Give up on trying to reform this guy and start focusing on what you need to do to make the kind of home you and your daughter need. Give back the ring and let your “fiance” know that until he is willing to grow up, get married, and help support his family, you’re not interested. Get a lawyer and find out what your rights are regarding chld support. Make sure that visitations with him are safe for your little girl.When you’ve stabilized your home, you can think about finding someone to love. I’m sure there is a good man out there who will love, cherish, and help provide for you and your little girl. Don’t accept anything less.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I am 51 and depressed because my husband is going thru his midlife crisis and left me and our 3 kids. What can I do and when is this midlife crisis going to end? He leaves me for another girl and lives life like he’s a teenager. His friends and family are urging and cheering him on for being a party guy. The woman he’s with is our old friend since 1986. She also has 3 kids but is divorced. They’re both going out partying every weekend, going to concerts like they’re both still in high school. He’s in his early 50s, she’s in her late 40s. Please help me, I still love him because we been together for over 27 years.<|im_end|>

 This is so, so sad. You certainly deserve to be treated better after 27 years of marriage. Of course you are depressed. The situation is depressing.To call this behavior a “mid life crisis” is to minimize his behavior. The man is having an affair. He may have been unhappy in your marriage for some time, but instead of talking to you about it or going to therapy to try to improve things, he has run away from the problems and run into the arms of someone who is very willing to have him. To me, this isn’t honorable or fair or even wise. Instead of manning up and dealing with the issues in his marriage, he is betraying his wife and family and he is avoiding taking any responsibility for his share in what went wrong.To make things worse, his family and friends aren’t being real friends to him. Instead of supporting him in being a man, they are cooperating in his return to boyhood.I’m sure this situation is complicated — only because affairs always are. It may be that the two of you didn’t recognize or avoided issues between you. It may be that the only way he saw to change the situation was to do something as radical as flight. It’s also possible that he is in a manic state. I have no way of knowing without talking to him.What I do know is that you can’t make him return to your family. But what you can do is take care of yourself and your children. I strongly encourage you to get into some therapy for yourself. You need to be talking to someone who can hear your whole story and who can make some concrete suggestions to help you through this. Your husband may be willing to join you for some therapy sessions — if only to talk about how to stay connected to his children. But even if he doesn’t, you deserve help with the depression and a place to talk about what to do next.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I’m 21. I have failed to retain any meaningful friendships during the whole course of my life. I have sometimes felt as if I am rarely around people that share my interests or I can get along with. I don’t have trouble making friends or getting along with people. When I meet someone that I feel is very genuine and easygoing I often feel very close to that person right away, but later the friendship fades and then I feel as if the closeness I thought I had with the person is an illusion. I have no people in my area that I spend time with regularly, and am not only extremely lonely, but have no sense of personal direction or interests that have any meaning to me. I am an attractive young woman, but can’t interest a man in a relationship, not even a boyfriend that is undesirable to me. I am so bored and disillusioned with everything at this point in my life that I don’t even feel like a real person. This has been a pattern that has been building since childhood.Is it possible I could live a normal life if I got psychotherapy?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 At 21, you should be embracing life with enthusiasm and passion for all its possibilities, not sinking into boredom and disillusionment. The fact that you are asking questions is a positive indication that you are ready to start making some changes. You know that there is more to life than this.Absolutely, therapy can help. Sometimes understanding ourselves is as impossible as looking at our own face without a mirror. We need someone outside of ourselves to see clearly what’s going on and what might be helpful. Ask your doctor for names of local therapists. Do your homework. Take a look at their websites and ask around about their reputations. Then make an appointment. Trust yourself. You may need to make a few initial appointments before you find a therapist who feels right for you. You need to find someone you feel you can trust.You made a very important first step in acknowledging the problem and writing to us here at PsychCentral. I hope you will follow through and find a therapist for yourself. You deserve it.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I always had a problem growing up being slow and being put in small classes in school. I was told I have ADHD and that is why I am so slow. But my mom told me 2 days ago that im mentally challenged. I am not sure what that is or if I have that or what. But I do find it hard to wright read and do math well it takes me longer than most people my age. am a really mentally challenged??? how do i find out if i am becouse i am having a hard time believing my mom. but also my mom told me i got tested and that what the doctor told her – that i am Mentally challenged but what i wanna know is can i grow out of it if i am or was???<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Hello and thanks for your question:When I read your letter I was saddened by the fact that someone would say that to you. We all have different ways of learning, and not everybody can be a rocket scientist, can they? I know that I have always struggled with math and in spite of that, I became a doctor. Mentally challenged just means that something can be hard for us to learn. You could say that I’m mentally challenged when it comes to math, but I have learned ways of coping, of dealing, with this over time. It can be really tough sometimes, and very frustrating, but I manage to get by.If you do have ADHD, it just means that you have a very hard time with paying attention. That doesn’t mean that you are slow, just unique in how you need to learn. Not everyone can learn the same way. You are old enough to have been tested in school. Did they do testing, and did they give you a diagnosis of ADHD? Did they have anything else they discovered with testing, or did teachers say that you have a learning disability in math, reading and writing? You are pretty good at writing, so I would have to wonder what the tests showed.Find out what the school thought was your problem. Then, here’s what you do: If you really have ADHD then there can be help out there. Medicine and treatment such as Neurofeedback can help fix it.  If you have a learning disability, find out what it is, and you can get some help there too.Help Guide’s website explains more about an ADHD diagnosis by stating, “Students with ADHD may become so easily distracted by noises, passersby, or their own thoughts that they often miss vital classroom information. These children have trouble staying focused on tasks that require sustained mental effort. They may seem as if they’re listening to you, but something gets in the way of their ability to retain the information.Additionally, Psych Central’s website states, “Everybody has things that they’re good at and things that they’re not as good at. People who have ADHD tend to be less good at paying attention to uninteresting things, tend to be forgetful and disorganized, etc. and while having ADD/ADHD may require extra time and effort for some tasks, many people diagnosed with the disorder have achieved success despite it and, sometimes, because of it.”Everybody has the ability to learn, even if it takes more time and can be very frustrating. But always remember you always have the ability. I want you to know you should never give up and push forward and you will always find a way – that works best for you- to learn. I hope this helps,<|im_end|>"

From Turkey: Back in July I met a guy through a friend. He found me through my friend’s Facebook page. After 2 weeks he wanted to become a couple. He seemed to rush things. He invited me to a wedding on the 10th day of our relationship, wanted to go on holiday with me and talked to his mother and sister about me. Then he inteoduced me to his friends. I thought such things were too premature at this early stage. In the meantime, I had a feeling like he had no relationship before and that I was his first girlfriend.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m sure this is very confusing and disappointing. Nothing you have said tells me anything about his sexual orientation. His penis size is irrelevant. His behavior with you could be caused by many things. My only guess is that he may be in some kind of approach/avoidance tension with love and sex.Your story reminds me of teenagers who want so much to be in love and to have sex but who are, at the same time, terrified of both. His behavior makes a kind of sense if his interest in you was his first attempt at a relationship or if he has had a number of failed relationships.The only way to know for sure is to ask him. If you can be curious and not take whatever he says as a personal rejection, you have little to lose by asking him what happened. But if your feelings are still raw, it may be better for you to remind yourself that his pursuit seemed too fast from the start and that this gentleman has too many problems to be a partner for you.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I’ve struggled with depression for the past 5 years. I’ve been prescribed various anti-depressants, anti-anxiety medications, and even ones for psychosis. -None of which have brought relief. I’ve tried engaging in hobbies, exercising, I’ve tried a healthier diet, but nothing seems to help. I feel the extent of my depression has increased, in severity, over time. I’m unsure as to whether or not this is related to the depression, but I, along with my environment, seem notably unreal. I have no idea what to do. I’ve felt this way since I was about 14. I’m approaching 20, and find my thoughts often touching on suicide. I’ve been committed to a crisis stabilization unit 5 times. Any avenue I can think of pursuing, in life, seems to be of immense futility. I can’t help but feel life is entirely meaningless. I’d undergone 2 MRI’s a few years ago. There were no abnormalities, so this is not due to some neurological discrepancy. I’ve tried various medications, counseling, and even holistic approaches. I’m bereft of options. I feel increasingly miserable. I cannot make the distinction of any circumstantial root to my feelings, yet I’ve had no success with medication. I don’t expect my involvement on this website to result in any resolve, but I just figured I’d give it a try.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
A: You pose an interesting situation because you report that you have already tried most of the suggestions I would make in this case. I would definitely suggest looking into possible medical causes. You stated that you have had MRI’s and have been hospitalized so I can only assume you’ve also had blood work done. Adding counseling, a healthy diet and exercise to your treatment plan also usually helps, but again, you state you’ve tried all this. However, have you tried these techniques consistently for a long enough period (at least 6 months) to note improvements?Have you sought out medical and psychological providers who specialize in treatment resistant depression? If not, I would suggest that you do, because those providers may have strategies that other providers haven’t tried. In my practice, I have specialized training in trauma as well as holistic/alternative therapeutic techniques. I’ve had great success in getting results with some clients who have not improved in prior treatment. I attribute this to what I call the “shotgun approach.” I’ll throw all my “tricks” at these folks and hope that some of them work. I’ve combined traditional talk therapy with EMDR, guided imagery, hypnosis, mindfulness, relaxation, and EFT. I also typically refer out to massage therapists, energy workers (such as Reiki) and/or acupuncturists, in addition to traditional medical providers.  Given your long standing history of depression, depersonalization and derealization, I wonder if you have any trauma in your history. Keep I mind that some trauma and neglect can occur at such a young age that you may not have memory of it and you might need to ask family members if you experienced anything particularly difficult or traumatic. Also, keep in mind that what one person finds traumatic, another may not.Bottom line: don’t give up.  You are worth it and some day you will find the right combination of techniques and medications to reach consistent improvement. In the meantime, try your best to focus on the good moments.All the best,<|im_end|>"

From a young man in Australia: Not a major complication but just interested in some different perspectives. I am a physically healthy late-30 year old man. I do not drink alcohol or smoke, I do not do drugs, I don’t gamble, and I try to avoid eating bad food too often. I exercise regularly and have a pretty good life (married, child, dog, run my own business). I also don’t waste money on buying random stuff to make myself feel rewarded”;.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
You are asking a very important question. The reason you find rewards like alcohol and drugs unrewarding is that they are artificial rewards. They have nothing to do with the act that is being rewarded. Thus they ring hollow. Often people keep giving themselves more and more of these phony rewards in an effort to, finally, feel rewarded but they are entirely missing the point.True gratification comes inherently from being totally and pleasurably involved in what you are doing. Positive Psychologists often quote Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi who, in 1975, named the ultimate internal gratification as “flow”.  He said, “Flow is being completely involved in an activity for its own sake. The ego falls away. Time flies. Every action, movement, and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing jazz”. Some people call it being “in the zone”.Other writers have emphasized that the only true way to positive self-esteem is to do good in the world. Doing good is something to feel good about. Doing good makes people feel good which motivates them to do more good things that contribute to the world.Nathaniel Branden, author of The Six Pillars Self-Esteem, said “How do we keep our inner fire alive? Two things at minimum are needed: An ability to appreciate the positives in our life — and a commitment to action.” That “inner fire” is the reward that matters.I’m sure you have at some time in your life experienced this, You get so into what you’re doing that time flies, you feel great, you get something accomplished that really matters to you. It’s a better high than any drug or drink or party can provide.My advice to you is to stop worrying about whether others are getting rewards you are not getting by partying. You aren’t missing a thing. Shoot for the inner satisfaction and gratification that is available to all of us if we stop looking outside of ourselves for rewards and instead do the things that make life joyful.I wish you well,<|im_end|>"

I have suffered with depression a lot in my life. I have been on and off meds and it keeps coming back. I told my family doc and she tried different meds and still it seemed to work for about a month and then nothing. She put me on the maximum amount of wellbutrin (450mg) and .5mg klonapin and said she thinks I need a mood stabilizer so I contacted a psychiatry practice to try and understand this more.<|im_end|>

 Your doctor may have used the phrase “bipolar spectrum” because she believes that you have bipolar disorder but is not sure which type. The three main types include bipolar I disorder, bipolar II and cyclothymic disorder. Bipolar I is considered the most severe and cyclothymic disorder, the least severe.Individuals who have bipolar I disorder experience episodes of mania. People with mania feel euphoria, grandiosity and emotionally “high.” They can also feel irritable. Their mood shifts rapidly. They can feel euphoric one moment and then quickly feel depressed and angry. Their behavior is erratic and they often behave in irresponsible ways. Psychosis can also be present.Individuals who are diagnosed with bipolar II also experience mood instability but not to the same degree that occurs with bipolar I disorder. Typically, more depressive symptoms are present than hypomania symptoms.Cyclothymic disorder is a chronic mood disorder that is present for at least two years. Like bipolar I and bipolar II, it is characterized by fluctuating mood disturbances and hypomania but the symptoms are less severe and less frequent. Many consider it a milder form of bipolar disorder.You take medication for your symptoms but that is not enough. Psychotherapy is an important treatment for mood disorders. Medication can stabilize your symptoms but psychotherapy allows you to address the underlying problem. You found it difficult to detail your family and self-history which tells me that you have yet to address the emotional pain that may be at the heart of some of your symptoms.I would recommend psychotherapy. Please consider it. Comprehensive psychological treatment involves both psychotherapy and medication. I wish you the best of luck.<|im_end|>"

So here is a synopsis of my problem:<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I believe you already know the answer to your question.You wrote that you are effectively giving up your life to be with him. You’re having doubts perhaps because intuitively you know that this relationship isn’t right for you.I don’t have many details about the relationship but based on the limited information provided it seems problematic. If you stay in this relationship, then you will have to accept all of his baggage. It also means that your wishes and desires will either be put on hold or they may never come to fruition.The question becomes, are you willing to sacrifice your life goals to be with this man? That’s a question that only you can answer.I would recommend meeting with a therapist who can gather many more details about your relationship and assist you in determining whether you’re making the right choice. Choose a therapist who specializes in relationships.You’re at a crossroads and I believe therapy at this point would be highly beneficial. It would afford you the opportunity to objectively evaluate your relationship with the assistance of a trained specialist. You may only need a few sessions to sort out your next move. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: It’s very hard for me. I love my fiancé very much, and I really like his 5 year old son, we all get along. Trouble is, I am incredibly sad he has a child with another woman. I want to have a baby and so does he. We are planning to start trying in the next year, but I’m scared of what’s to come. I don’t want to feel like he’s “been there done that” and it’s not as special to him. I’m afraid it will make me depressed. Like when he feels our baby move for the first time, will he have flashbacks of son #1? Even if he doesn’t I will be thinking that’s what he’s thinking and I will instantly be depressed. It’s to the point where I feel jealous every time he talks to, or about his son and baby mama. My therapist is trying to help my change my negative thoughts into positive ones by saying a little mantra in my head every time I feel sadness.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m glad you are already talking to your therapist about this. I probably don’t have anything to add, but I’ll contribute a couple of thoughts: Even though your fiancé has already had a child, he hasn’t had a child with you. Every pregnancy is different. Every birth is different. Every child is different. If he’s the man you think he is, he will be into the unique and special qualities of your pregnancy and the baby you are making together. He doesn’t have to reject his other experience to fully value this one. As one of my teachers has said, you don’t have to reject chocolate because you love strawberry. One can be delighted by both.I think you already know that asking your fiancé to stop talking about his son or his son’s mom will only damage your relationship. To love him is to love his child and to appreciate, not criticize, his past. To raise the little boy successfully, you should ideally have a civilized relationship with his mother.The other question I would put to you is this: Since you love each other enough to want to bring a child into the world, why aren’t you getting married? I’m of the opinion that children deserve to be brought into a secure, stable, and committed family. If your experience as a child of divorce is keeping you from making that commitment, please work on that before you have a child. Otherwise, it’s very possible you will repeat history. You owe it to yourself, your guy, and the child-to-be to resolve your issues before going ahead with a pregnancy.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My wife suffers from depression but doesn’t acknowledge the symptoms. What should I do??. She’s been in therapy 20+ years, has a family history of mental illness and addiction on both sides of her family. A few years back, she hit a rough patch in life where she lost her grandmother (who raised her) and her job in the span of a few months. She was in a bad place with her family dealing with a lot of anxiety, depression and emotional issues. Together we got her the help she needed. Found her a new doctor and therapist. She’s been taking Wellbutrin for about 2 years now and it seems she’s leveled out. However, this past Nov/ Dec. she stopped taking it for about 2 -3 months. The only reason she gave me was that she couldn’t get to see her doctor to get a new prescription. (Background: we relocated to a new city this past year, new jobs, new routines, new doctors, etc…). She finally started up the PX again a few weeks ago. She’s about 3 weeks back on the meds but her old symptoms have popped up. (I don’t know the psychological terms, but she thinks that certain people are constantly talking about her and plotting against her. So she lashes out at them, mostly through emails and texts, admonishing them for their actions. None of them are actually doing anything so it creates a lot of family tension and anger. She tries to hide most of this behavior from me. And when I challenge her on the validity of her accusations, she tries to change the subject, gets really angry, or accuses me of being in on whatever conspiracy is at hand. The things she believes these people are saying about her, are very close to the stresses that she currently has in her life. Besides this, she seems visibly agitated, upset and has trouble focusing.<|im_end|>

 I deeply appreciate your situation. It sounds like you have done all you can for your wife — now it is time to do something for you. I would highly recommend Al-Anon. While it might seem odd to recommend a 12-step program for family and friends of alcoholics, your wife’s behavior sounds like it is an outgrowth of being in an alcoholic family — and as such makes you affected by it. This 12-step program will offer support, culled wisdom, fresh thoughts and inspiration. You may also want to supplement this with your own therapy. Turn your attention away from her and toward yourself.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I Was Diagnosed With PTSD By My Therapist When I Was 14. I was born with a major disfiguring birth defect, have had around 20 operations.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
PTSD comes from a chronic mental and emotional stress that happens as a result of a deep psychological shock that most often disturbs sleep, with a constant recollection, usually with vivid detail of the shock or injury that’s taken place. (To learn more about PTSD, please read here.) But there are many variations of what causes a posttraumatic stress disorder, one of which is known as Complex PTSD (C-PTSD.)You will learn in this link that C-PTSD has different criteria than the diagnosis for PTSD, but this differential is subtle and not often fully recognized, even by therapists. Also, C-PTSD is not a formal diagnosis that appears in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM) which is used by clinicians for identifying a collection of symptoms. It is classically seen as something that has emerged from an assortment of different sources:I am not suggesting that you have this, but I am suggesting it may be worth talking to the original therapist who diagnosed you and ask them to share their thoughts about their diagnosis or to make an appointment with a clinical psychologist who is licensed to be able to perform testing that could help you identify your diagnosis more readily. Because C-PTSD isn’t an official category in the DSM individuals who may meet its criteria may have been given the label PTSD because it is the only one officially recognized.Also, as a side note, if you haven’t read the extraordinary memoir Autobiography of A Face  by Lucy Greay, I’d encourage you to put it on your list.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: Well I have to start from the beginning. When we first got together he had told me he got cheated on by his ex in the 8th grade and he suffered from trust issues. For our first year he made me feel like I had to tip toe around him bc everything I did he thought it was proof that I had cheated. I would explain to him that I was the one who had no prior boyfriend and that he was the only guy to kiss me or hold my hand. I finally said enough is enough and broke up with him, and he begged me to stay and magically he stopped with the accusing. Well after our two year rolled around he finally told me that he had cheated on her in retaliation then broke off with her. He hadn’t slept with his ex or his mistress but he lied to me. idk if I can trust him. He has me in a depression I cant get out of bc I love him so much. We had problems before but they are getting better but idk what to do about the lying. For my sanity’s sake.<|im_end|>

 I think you are describing a man who has been growing up. This all started when he was only 12 or 13. Heartbreak at that age can be devastating, it’s true. But it’s also the time when people start to learn about relationships and how to handle rejection. The fact that he was still “recovering” from the breakup when he was 18 or so says to me that he didn’t have the inner courage or the external supports to try again until he met you. He was therefore behaving quite immaturely, thinking that controlling you was the way to keep himself from being hurt. As he discovered, trapping someone doesn’t make a good relationship. In an effort to be honest with you, he told you about something he did when he was an immature 13 or 14 year old. Instead of being sympathetic with the young and confused boy he was, you are holding a 20 year old man responsible for what he did 7 years ago.Please take a deep breath and ask yourself: Do you really want to be held accountable for everything you did when you were young as well? Most of us do things when we are growing up that in hindsight look pretty stupid. But it’s part of growing up.If he has evolved into a decent, honest guy and you really love him, you owe it to both of you to see him as he is now instead of how he was as a young teen. If he learned from his mistakes and loves you as much as you love him, then you can drop the distrust and depression.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I am sorry that you are struggling. You have had a difficult life. The good news is that you can overcome depression and change your life. Help is available. Many people have had depression, sought treatment and were able to make remarkable recoveries. Even individuals who have had depression for decades can experience significant improvements with the assistance of a mental health professional. You did not mention, in your letter, whether you’ve sought treatment. If not, you should.Once meeting with your therapist he or she can refer you to a case manager who could assist you in getting your GED and a job. A great place to start would be your local community mental health center. If you have health insurance, call the 800 number on the back of your card for a referral to a mental health professional in your community.Many people are reluctant to seek professional help. Even those who have suffered for many years often don’t see the value in seeing a therapist. Some hold the opinion that seeking professional help is a sign of weakness. They hold the distorted view that everyone should be able to solve their own problems. Others don’t wish to share the intimate details of their life with a stranger. Unfortunately, those attitudes remain prevalent in our society and contribute to the millions of people who live with untreated mental illnesses. Studies consistently show that individuals willing to seek treatment have the greatest likelihood of success.Depression often creates tunnel vision. Individuals with depression have difficulty believing in a brighter future. Many feel alone, despondent and can’t envision a positive change in their emotional status. In this way, depression distorts one’s view of reality. Realize that there is help for you. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost three years. We get along great and would do anything for each other. However, our relationship has taken a slight turn for the worse just this past month. My boyfriend smokes marijuana everyday (I personally do not, but dont mind that he does). And i knew that sometimes on special occasion he used other drugs as well, such as cocaine. This never really bothered me because he kept reassuring me that him and his friends were smart about the drug, knew how dangerous it could be if not handled correctly. And the special occasion cocaine use never effected our relationship or how well we were together.<|im_end|>

 As you are finally discovering, when someone is involved with drugs, they are not completely involved with you. There has always been an affair in this relationship — his affair with drugs. The good news is that he has admitted to an addiction problem. Apparently, the hospitalization was a wakeup call. The test of whether he is someone to stay with is whether he follows up with treatment. People can and do get into long-term recovery. People can and do give up drugs forever.Your role in this is to cease being so tolerant! You absolutely should mind that he is using weed every day. You absolutely shouldn’t tolerate that he uses cocaine — even occasionally. It may not affect your life all that much now when you’re both in high school but it will definitely affect his ability to get on with adult life once you get out of school. Growing up means learning to manage emotions, decisions, social life, and relationships without the haze of drugs. He needs to find a better group of friends and much better things to do with his time that will help him prepare to get into adult life, not check out of it.I suggest you find the local chapter of Alateen to help you figure out how best to be helpful and whether the signs are right that he is worth sticking around for. Alateen is part of the Al-Anon programs. It helps teens who are affected by someone else’s drug or alcohol use. Check out the Alateen website. You will find out more about the program and and you can locate a meeting near you.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I am sorry that this has happened to you and I’d like to challenge what you are calling strange love. It isn’t love — not at all. I am not challenging your feelings because I understand the confusion. You didn’t have a choice in who your sexual partner was going to be, did not want it to the point of having the police involved. This is about sexual abuse and the resulting reactions that happen. He did something to you at an age where you should have been protected from him. Feeling bad for him, wanting his attention, and being confused about all of this isn’t a healthy love. It is often some of the complex feelings involved after abuse.I believe some individual therapy would be good for you to engage in as it can help you sort through these feelings of “strange love” and revenge.

Hi, I don’t know whether I am just reading too much into things or whether there actually is something wrong with me. I have noticed that I am very sad quite often I have also noticed that I tend to fidget a lot and cannot stay quite for long, I also have mood swings very regularly where I will be completely fine and then get really moody with friends and family for no reason. I get stressed out a lot over the smallest of things and cannot get anything done as I get too easily distracted. I have a very short attention span and cant spend much time on things before I get bored and give up, I tend to space out a lot as well and just snap back into reality after about 10 minutes which makes concentrating in class very hard. I also used to have tendencies to become very violent and lash out at people for no reason. I am not sure whether this is normal or not and whether I am just getting worked up over nothing but these symptoms have been going on for about 7 years now and don’t think that is normal to have felt this way for so long, so I am asking you to get a professional view on this as I don’t want to mention it to my parents just in case they tell me I am being silly and there is nothing wrong with me<|im_end|>

 Seven years is a very long time to be worried about something. I can’t offer a diagnosis on the basis of a letter. But I can tell you that the distractability and fidgeting is consistent with ADHD. The moodiness may have more to do with your age than a mental illness. But, again, I can’t really make an assessment via email. A professional who can talk to you and get to know you can be much more helpful.I suggest you share your letter and this response with your parents. Sometimes worrying about something can be as distressing as the original problem. Ask them to help you make some appointments to help you understand yourself better.I suggest you first see your physician to make sure that everything is fine physically. The teen years are a time of enormous physical growth and change. Sometimes it takes awhile for the body to adjust. If everything checks out medically, then see a mental health professional for an assessment. When you know what you are dealing with, you and your parents can make informed decisions about what to do to make life a bit easier for you to manage.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I am stuck in a very frustrating situation. I have a 11 year old with Aspergers. My son has one close friend. This close friend and my son have known each for 4 years.<|im_end|>

 Based on your description, the boy’s mother may have symptoms consistent with a psychotic disorder. Please bear in mind that I cannot confidently offer a diagnosis over the Internet. To make an accurate diagnosis, I would have to interview her in person but based on your description of her symptoms, a psychotic disorder is a reasonable conclusion. Believing that she is being spied upon (paranoia) and communicated with (magical thinking) are common symptoms of psychosis.You find it “sick… that she’s using a nonverbal child and putting him in this situation.” It is important to understand that if she is psychotic, this is not willful behavior on her part. Just as it is impossible to intentionally develop symptoms of cancer, it is equally impossible to intentionally develop symptoms of psychosis. No one chooses to become psychotic.Having said that, I believe that your concerns are valid. You worry about whether or not her behavior is negatively impacting her child. In addition, you understandably want to ensure the well-being of your child. The boy’s mother is displaying bizarre symptoms and you want your son to be protected. This is perfectly reasonable and understandable.With regard to your specific question about how to get her to see that she needs help, this will likely be very difficult. It might be better to bring your concerns to the attention of her husband. Let him know about the behavior that you have witnessed and your concerns. As an acquaintance of the family, there is little else that you can do.One way to assist the family would be to make them aware of resources such as the National Alliance for Mental Illness (NAMI). NAMI is great because they provide much-needed guidance and education for family members who have a loved one with a mental illness. They can also assist families who are trying to navigate the mental health system.It is a troubling situation for all involved. Mental illness affects millions of people. When a loved one has a mental illness it is not just the individual with the mental illness who suffers but friends and family as well. Hopefully, your friend and her family will receive the proper help. I wish you the best. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Hey, I sometimes feel like there is a weight on my chest a heavy rock as if someone if pressing my chest I feel anxious and uneasy, sometimes I can’t even give a name to my feelings and I sit there wondering what do I have, I have some symptoms of OCD for example in a shop I so I’d touch dresses and if I touch one with my left hand it has to be touched by my right hand as well in the same manner there are many more examples of such things but I have never had an anxiety attack. What is this? (From India)<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Thank you for writing us. Chronic physical pain in your chest can happen for many reasons. Before you try guessing at what might be the cause I believe ruling out a medical reason is the first order of business.Get yourself a very thorough physical from your physician. Be sure he or she knows that you have the symptoms and explain how long and how severe they’ve been. You don’t want to be looking for psychological reasons when there might be a very clear and easy to treat medical condition or situation that is causing it.As a quick check on the internet will confirm, chest pain can come from a variety of sources including muscle strain, peptic ulcers, an injured rib, asthma, a collapsed lung, hiatal hernia, tuberculosis, pneumonia, and angina. Notice these are only a few of the possibilities that can cause it and these are physical rather than psychological. The psychological ones, like panic attacks and anxiety disorders, weren’t even included in my initial list. You don’t want to be treating something like a psychological symptom when the real culprit may be medical. This is often a costly mistake in terms of time. People needing medical attention sometimes wait too long to get diagnosis and treatment medically because they believe something else is causing it. Don’t let this be true in your case. See your physician sooner rather than later.To help your physician keep a journal of the times when you get these pains. When do they become more intense? What were you doing just before they occurred? How long did they last? what eventually relieved it? Going in armed with this information can give your physician a very good starting place to diagnose and treat it if it is physical. If it isn’t, he or she can refer you to someone who can look at these symptoms through a psychological lens and help you find the right solutions.For a more complete list of symptoms related to medical causes of chest pains check here. For more information on anxiety disorders check here. There is also a quiz where you can assess your anxiety level here.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

 I’m so, so sorry. This discovery must be devastating for you. You’re probably right that there is a connection of some kind between his past and his activities. Sometimes people who have been abused conclude that there are only two roles in the world: victim or abuser. Not wanting to be victimized any more, they take the other role. It’s a shame that your husband didn’t stick with therapy long enough to learn that there are other alternatives.As sneaky and inappropriate as his behavior has been, he does seem to have some control over his impulses. He apparently has confined his activities to people over 18. That takes some self-control. He is apparently self-aware enough to understand that there are legal consequences to crossing the line of age of consent.As painful as this may be, I think you need to ask your children if he has ever touched them inappropriately, just to be sure that he hasn’t reenacted his own abuse in the family. It isn’t necessarily the case but for your children’s sake, it’s important to check it out.If you think he could be victimizing younger people, I suppose you could tell him of your suspicions to see how he reacts. Do be sure to have such a conversation in a place where you feel safe. Unless you have more than your gut feeling to go on, there probably isn’t anything else you can do about his psychological health or his behavior.Instead, focus on making a good life for yourself and your children. You now have the opportunity to find someone who can give you the love, affection, and sexual connection you’ve longed for for many, many years.I wish you well, <|im_end|>"

I am always paranoid of what people think of me, who I hang out with and if my friends said “Hi” to me or not.

 First of all, I want you to know you are not alone in these feelings. I’d venture that most teens feel this way a good deal of the time. You are at an age and stage where you are figuring out a lot about life, relationships, and what and who you want to be. it can be overwhelming at times. It can make a person anxious and depressed. But it’s perfectly normal to have those concerns.The people who seem to make it through the best are those who have a passion about something that takes their mind off all those confusing issues a good part of every week. There’s something about sharing experiences with people who have a smiliar commitment to something outside of themselves that cuts through some of the anxiety or at least sets it aside for awhile. Some kids find their passion in music and get into a band. Some join a theatre group. Some work at a sport or two. Others spend hours in the dance studio, an art studio, or the gym. Still others find meaning in volunteering for a cause, helping out at an animal shelter, or getting involved in politics. It doesn’t matter what it is as long as you really care about it and join up with other people who care about it too.If you don’t yet know what would grab your interest, try a bunch of things. You’ll know when you find it. When you do, you’ll discover that it is by getting involved that you’ll find yourself. A bonus is that people who are passionately involved with other things often do better in school as well.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From a teen in the U.S.: My mental disturbances have been getting progressively worse, and I am beginning to suspect schizophrenia. I only took notice of these disturbances when I began ruminating over things I had done in the past, and began convincing myself I was going to be arrested for these things. At first I thought it was OCD, because I was diagnosed at a very young age, but now I’ not sure that’s the overall issue.<|im_end|>

But your therapist knows you and can meet with you regularly to help. Do share your letter with her as a way to start an important conversation.Your letter shows you to be a sensitive and articulate young woman who thinks deeply about things.

From Romania: A little about me first: I’m not a virgin. I had sex about fifty times with two girls since I was 16. I no longer interact with them. I used to masturbate frequently, but I stopped 2 months ago as an experiment. I don’t want to start this habit again.<|im_end|>

 The convincing argument is embedded in your email. Everything you are talking about only has to do with you. These are fantasies, desires, and wishes that exist only inside your thoughts. These are your fantasies — not your mother’s. All of these things are only about satisfying your imagination — not about anything else. At 22 years old, the work for you is to understand this fantasy at a deeper level. The attraction of a boy toward his mother has been studied since the beginning of psychology. However, it is understood as a developmental yearning that helps to form intimate relationships with others. Your fantasy is about being good enough to get love. The work in front of you is to understand what you need in intimate relationships from others — not from your mother.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From a young teen in the U.S.:  I’m 13 and don’t know if I’m just weird but I can turn on and turn off my apathy levels? I can turn it off and act like how people are supposed to act during certain situations (raising my empathy/decreasing my apathy).  For example, when I turn it off and something happens to a friend I feel worried and stuff but it’s also kinda feels fake?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
I think what’s going on is that you trying to manage three different emotional issues at once. Your letter shows you to be an exceptionally emotionally aware person. You are going through the physical changes that happen in adolescence. And, on top of that, you mention kind of as an aside that you have been diagnosed with PTSD. Any one of those could make a person shut down (or at least try to) when overwhelmed by emotional situations.The teen years can be tough because so much is going on. You are figuring out who you are. Your body is changing. You are trying to figure out who you will love and what that love stuff is all about anyway. If that weren’t enough, you have apparently been traumatized by some event or events that were so severe that you developed PTSD in response.I hope that having a diagnosis means that you are also being treated by a mental health professional, preferably someone who specializes in trauma and adolescence. You don’t have to figure everything out on your own. In fact, it’s not even wise to try. A professional can help you manage the effects of trauma and sort out your feelings.Medication is not likely to be helpful for PTSD for someone who is only 13. No medications have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of PTSD in children. What you need is talk therapy. Trauma focused cognitive behavior therapy has been found to be the most effective. You need a mental health counselor who has those skills.The best help I can offer you is to encourage you to make an appointment right away to someone who can hear your whole story and who can provide you with regular and consistent support and advice.If you are already seeing a counselor, do take your letter and this response to your next appointment. It may help to direct what you talk about next.I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

I’ve had social anxiety as long as I can remember, and I can remember back to pre-school. I did not get diagnosed until I was 17. A couple years before, I started experiencing moments in time where I felt like I wasn’t in reality. I felt as if my arms did not belong to me and that I was looking through someone else’s eyes. My surroundings would seem non-existent. I never told my therapist of these incidents.<|im_end|>

 A diagnosis is only useful if it provides a way of understanding the symptoms. I wouldn’t worry so much about what your condition is called, I’d concern myself more with symptom reduction.

Trying to unravel all this without talking to your therapist will make it much more difficult.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I’ve been dating a guy for almost 2 years. He has a high sex drive. Although I very much enjoy sex with him, sometimes I don’t want to have sex. Reasons vary but usually it’s because my tummy hurts from my period or he’s was just being kind of a insensitive at dinner which never makes me want to share my most intimate parts or be so close.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 If the issue is confined to sex, then it could be that you two have a major difference in sex drive. In that case, the two of you need to have a serious talk, when you are both calm and not in the middle of an argument, to talk about how you are going to handle that difference without hurting each other.But, often, when a couple has issues around sex, there are other problems in the relationship. When you are in disagreement, is he able to compromise? Give in at times? Does he understand that a relationship is about give as well as take? Do you get warmth and support and help when you need it? Or is life pretty much on his terms?If the issues around sex are a reflection of your relationship, I hope you will take a big step back. In that case, I don’t think there is anything you can do or say to influence how your guy thinks about sex. He seems to think he is entitled to it whenever he is ready. He doesn’t seem to care whether you are really willing. For that reason, I think you are asking the wrong questions. The question to ask is why you are staying with a guy who is so selfish and self-centered.Sex with a loved and loving partner is an expression of intimacy and togetherness. Both people need to be interested for it to be more than simply a physical release for one and an ordeal for the other. Yes, sometimes sex is a gift we give each other when we aren’t totally into it. But it’s unfair for him to regularly pressure you when you don’t feel well or when you aren’t feeling particularly close to him.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I have been in a relationship with a lovely man for 2.5 years. We are engaged and have booked our wedding. Last week, we went to a party and he got way too drunk. I had asked him to stop drinking sprits in May as he once became aggressive towards me (threw keys at me, verbally abused me). However, he drank spirits last week which he hadn’t since May, and when we got home, I was subjected to a tirade of verbal abuse for several hours. He is not addicted to alcohol, and neither am I. He has promised to stop drinking altogether, and so have I. We have started relationship counseling with a view to amend this issue, but some things about his co-dependent relationship with his mother have come up. She is a lovely woman with whom I have always got on, but I fear that he has been talking to her more about his problems than to me. I’m now also afraid that his turbulent childhood will impact upon my life. My friends think that I shouldn’t marry him as he became so aggressive when drunk, and in London everyone drinks a LOT all the time. I am trying to make the wisest decision possible. It’s been a terrible week and would be grateful for any input.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 There may be people in London who drink “a lot” but certainly there are people in London who don’t drink at all. In fact, according to the National Health Service (NHS) statistics, there is less drinking done by Londoners than anywhere else in the country.How much other people drink, relative to how much your boyfriend drinks, has no bearing on your relationship. The heart of the matter is this: your boyfriend has a drinking problem. It is clear that he shouldn’t drink. When he drinks he becomes abusive.When people drink, their inhibitions decrease. They may do or say things that they would not normally do or say. You can’t teach him to drink and not become abusive; it is simply impossible. When he drinks he becomes abusive, which is precisely why he should not drink.It’s good that you and he are in counseling. It is a very positive sign. It’s also a good sign that he was able to abstain from drinking since May. It may mean that he’s amenable to change. I would encourage you to continue counseling, for as long as it is needed, to come to a resolution about his drinking and the relationship.Ultimately, if he is unwilling to stop drinking, then you may want to consider ending the relationship. If not, when he drinks you will be subjected to verbal abuse. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

How do I help her? My family has a history of schizophrenia. I grew up with both a grandaddy and aunt who had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, so I know just what it looks like. By the time my daughter was showing symptoms she was already on the streets self medicating with meth and heroin. This is a girl who was the senior class vice president, attended poetry club and was a member of ROTC. Within six months she had dropped out of college and was living on the streets. We’ve tried to have her in rehab but she just leaves within a few days. She needs to be formally diagnosed but I don’t know how to make that happen. The police won’t even take a missing persons report because as far as their concerned she’s just another drug addict. I don’t have health insurance and neither does she. She needs the kind of help people like me cannot afford. I have heard some news about what area of town she might be in (we have not seen or heard from her in over three months) but even if I were to find her…how can I possibly help her? At this point I feel my only option is to wait until I’m informed her body has been found.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I am sorry that you are faced with this very difficult problem. Among those with schizophrenia, these types of stories are relatively common. About half of those with schizophrenia cannot recognize that they are ill due to a neurological condition called anosognosia and subsequently refuse all treatments. The unfortunate result is that they suffer tremendously. Many will never receive needed life-saving treatments.In the United States, in order to be forcibly hospitalized, an individual has to have demonstrated that they are imminently dangerous to themselves or to others.The majority of states will also forcibly hospitalize somebody if they are “gravely disabled.” Though definitions vary by state, an individual is “gravely disabled” if they are unable to properly care for themselves due to their illness. In the case of your daughter, if you were able to locate her you may be able to make the case that she is “gravely disabled.”Unfortunately, even if she were involuntarily committed, she would likely only be in the hospital for a relatively short period of time. The average psychiatric hospital stay is approximately seven days. The fact that she doesn’t have health insurance might mean that a hospital is less likely to extend her stay when she no longer is a “danger to self.” Hospitals are legally obligated to treat patients who are a danger to themselves or to others but once patients no longer meet this criteria and they do not have health insurance, patients are sometimes discharged, often before they are fully psychologically stable.The unfortunate reality in this situation is that your daughter may be beyond your help at this point. If you can’t find her, then you can’t help her. You should do everything you can within your power to help her but then realize that you can do no more.I would encourage you to contact the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). NAMI members can relate to what you are experiencing because many of their adult children are facing a similar challenge. NAMI members can also assist you with specific ideas about how you can help your daughter. Most communities have a local NAMI chapter. Utilize their skills and knowledge to assist you in this situation.I would also encourage you to read the book “I’m Not Sick I Don’t Need Help” by Xavier Amador. This book thoroughly explains why some people with schizophrenia have difficulty understanding that they are ill and it advises families about how to deal with this very challenging situation. It is a “must-read” for individuals who have a loved one with schizophrenia. Please don’t hesitate to write again if you have additional questions. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I am a 12 year old who has not been diagnosed with any disorders. My problem: “intrusive” thoughts. These thoughts started like this: I felt guilty because I felt happiness when somebody died in a movie I was watching. I decided to test myself out by thinking of the most repulsive action ever and then then try to make myself tempted. The repulsive action was harming my mother. I was confident that I would have no urge to do it. I tried tempting myself by having my brain repeatedly cheer do it! I felt an enormous urge to do it, which stressed me out. Does this count as an intrusive thought? My worst problem is the urge to do it. This urge kept coming and coming. Sometimes I feel like I want to give into this urge. Sometimes I feel like I have to carry out these urges. Is this another part of intrusive thoughts? And if you don’t think this is an intrusive thought, could this urge be related to curiosity, desire for infame or maybe even psychosis? Could I be confusing the adrenaline I feel with the urges. These urges get stronger when I feel love for my mother. So my questions are, do these thoughts count as intrusive thoughts, and are these urges normal?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It does not seem like an intrusive thought. Intrusive thoughts are thoughts that enter your mind against your will. They can be very distressing. You willed the thought of harming your mother into your mind. That is the opposite of an intrusive thought.The urges you wrote about and the energy behind them could be excitement or nervousness. They could also be related to curiosity but not a desire for infamy or a psychosis.It is difficult to answer your question about whether or not these are normal thoughts. You are free to think anything you want and your thoughts could have occurred in response to a movie you were watching.It is not healthy to want to harm your mother. Those thoughts can be distressing especially if they are frequent and lead a person to consider acting on them. At that point, it’s best to consult a mental health professional to prevent them from worsening. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Okay, to give a little backstory when I was 10 until 12 years old I had a friend who was three years older than me of the same gender and when I was at their house they would kiss me and touch me in ways I really did not like, she would also get me to take off my clothes. She would also bully me and exclude me in class. She would also tell me that I was a lesbian and another boy would also tell me this as well. It really hasn’t had much of an effect of me (I haven’t talked to any adult about it) but I have come to the conclusion now that I’m gay, but I don’t know if I just think I am because of this and it’s just my reaction to it or if I actually am.

 Modern scientists generally believe that homosexuality is not a choice. Many studies support the idea that people are born gay or straight. Horrific attempts have been made to change a person’s sexual orientation by purveyors of conversion therapy attempting to “cure” homosexuality. Those conversions did not work and caused a great deal of trauma. Conversion therapy has been discredited by prominent and legitimate medical and mental health organizations including the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, among others. They have all deemed it dangerous and ineffective.You said yourself that the experience “hasn’t had much an effect on me.” That is probably true as it did not change your sexual orientation. It was an unpleasant and abusive experience undoubtedly, but life events can’t change your sexual orientation.Confusion over sexual identify is often a feature of youth. Developmentally, it is normal to wonder about one’s sexuality at this stage in your life. The teen years are full of confusion and doubt. It might be helpful to discuss these issues with a counselor. Therapy is a safe place to explore issues of sexuality. Good luck and please take care.<|im_end|>"

I didn’t always used to be this way, but I would say in the last two years I feel like my mental state has diminished quite a bit. At home, I am finding it hard to perform very simple tasks everyday. The same set of dirty dishes have been in the sink for weeks just simply because I cannot find the will to complete them. Laundry gets ignored for weeks. I have no motivation to get things done that I know need to be done. I sleep much more than I should and find it hard everyday just to get out of bed, regardless if I work or I’m off.  I do manage to go to work on time everyday, though. But I’m finding it harder everyday to get my work done. I didn’t use to have a terrible memory but now its hard to remember tasks that were assigned to me less than 30 minutes prior; it doesn’t matter if they emailed it to me or told me to my face. I’m always late in completing my work when I have deadlines, and often times I either stay many hours after work to finish something, or just flat don’t finish it at all.  But I’m not depressed, at least I wouldn’t think so. I’m a pretty happy person when I am around others. When I am by myself, though, I tend to feel guilty for not completing things, whether that be the dishes or taking the car to the mechanic. It doesn’t matter how big, small, or significant it is, I feel guilty if it did not get completed. I also feel like I must have some sort of anxiety when I’m in a situation that is not part of my everyday routine. I put off taking my car to the mechanic, just because I am too nervous to deal with speaking with the mechanic. I put off grocery shopping because I am freaked out to be in the store with other people. Any responsibility I have for my life, such as paying bills, shopping, etc, if it can be done online, I will do it that way. If I have to call someone or see them in person, I will put it off for weeks or even months just to avoid being in a situation that I am uncomfortable with. I’m just looking for some advice to know if there’s anything I can do to stop feeling so worried about going out to other places besides my house or my job. Is there anything I can do to find the motivation to get simple tasks done? Any thoughts for my increasingly worse memory? I appreciate you taking the time to read this, and any advice would be amazing.<|im_end|>

 A: I know you say you don’t think you are depressed, but you have listed many symptoms of depression within your question. Depression doesn’t always include the subjective experience of feeling “depressed,” such as sadness and crying. Some of the symptoms also include the loss of interest in pleasurable activities, fatigue or loss of energy, problems with sleep, poor concentration or memory, feelings of worthlessness, and excessive guilt. Many times this can translate into feeling unmotivated and unproductive. It is also common for people to withdraw socially, possibly because of the energy required to interact with others, or because they have more anxiety than usual.  Memory problems can be one of the first signs of stress. I look at it like this: if the system is overloaded and you aren’t concentrating well, typical information doesn’t make it to the “memory bank” to be retrieved later. Memory problems can be caused by many things, both psychological and medical.There are lots of studies that show that a healthy diet and exercise is one of the best ways to improve mood and energy levels, so this is something you can do on your own.  You might also want to consider some vitamins and supplements, if you haven’t already. Finally, I’d suggest seeing your medical doctor to get some lab work completed to rule out medical causes, and if things don’t improve soon, I would also suggest finding a good therapist. Hope you feel better soon.All the best,<|im_end|>"

 What a sad and complicated situation. You’ve taken the first and important step. You’ve decided you need to do something instead of run away or continue the lies. That’s the first step towards being the responsible man you want to be — but only the first step.I can’t tell you what to do, of course. The situation is much too complex and it involves several other people besides yourself. So the next step is to locate a local therapist who can do what I can’t. He or she will be able to hear the whole story and, knowing your country’s resources and laws, can provide you with some direction.Once you’ve handled the immediate crisis, it’s important that you continue therapy to figure out why you allowed yourself to lose yourself so completely.

The solution, as difficult as it may sound, is to get out of your room and do something, anything, that is productive and with healthy people. Instead of isolating, find someplace in your community that needs help and offer to volunteer.Being a cleaner probably isn’t the answer, unless it is with a fun group. Instead, find a senior program or a program with kids or a charitable organization that can use some help. It doesn’t have to be complicated. Sometimes such programs just need help sorting stuff or help with clerical work or a fundraising campaign.The advantage of volunteer work is that it puts you in regular contact with other people who share an interest. There is no pressure to be an instant friend. Everyone is there to get a job done. Friendships develop gradually and organically.I do think you need some therapy to help you deal with your guilt and with trauma from sexual encounters like the one with your uncle. The treatment of choice in the U.S. for Borderline Personality Disorder is Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). See if there is something like it in your country. You can also research it online. If DBT isn’t available in the Netherlands, get a referral from your doctor to a therapist who specializes in personality disorders and trauma.You need and deserve therapy to help you make a new start in your emotional life. You are only 19 with the potential for a long and productive life ahead. Take care of yourself — please. Get the therapy you need. You are worth it.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I have been dating and living with my boyfriend for 18 months. He cheated with his ex from the start and for the first 6 months of our relationship. I caught him, he lied, then confessed – several times. He claimed he loved me and wanted me. (He told me that they were over when we got together, but he did NOT tell me that while they were indeed split up, he’d been desperately trying to get her back for 2 years and was still trying and couldn’t get over her.)  So, he claims he is finally over her now and sees her for the horrid person she is. He loves and wants me. I believe him (reluctantly and somewhat suspiciously). I am trying to trust him. Ex says she doesn’t want him but was just trying to break us up by seeing him. Unfortunately, Ex has a grandson (her daughter’s son – not his biological grandson). Ex was raising the boy (now 4 yrs) when they were together so he was also very close to the boy. She refuses to let him see the grandson claiming that HE is NOT family.<|im_end|>

 Your best bet would be to run as fast as you can away from the situation and cut your losses before it gets any more complicated. I know that’s easier said than done, but starting a new relationship with so many barriers is going to be very difficult to overcome.Was he cheating on her with you or cheating on you with her? Either way, it’s not good. Even if their relationship was in fact over by the time you started dating, he was obviously not “over her” and had not taken enough time before getting involved with someone else. And even though you are dating him and not his family, starting a relationship off on the wrong foot with family can take a long time for things to settle down. You should really think about whether all this is something you want to deal with and if you really feel like you can trust him. If you decide to move forward, I highly suggest that you attend a few couple’s therapy sessions together. Good luck with it all.All the best,<|im_end|>"

I have been this way my entire life, I have done some searching but it seems as if I don’t reach the extent that many others do.

 We should not believe in the stereotype that men should never cry. In fact, some women perceive males who show this side of themselves as being more sensitive, caring or in touch with their emotions than the “average” male. In this way it could be seen as a positive and desirable quality. Suppressing versus expressing. Certainly, there are those times when crying is socially acceptable and times when it is not.At the heart of your question is why are you reacting with tears or anger when you otherwise consider yourself a happy, well-adjusted individual. You mentioned your alcoholic father. You may be struggling with unresolved issues with your father. It might also be a problem of impulse control. You oftentimes feel very emotional but at times you seem to lack the necessary skills to keep some emotions under control.You have identified this as a problem that is interfering with your life. It is negatively affecting your relationships with others. My recommendation is to seek help for this problem before your anger grows out of control. You would never want to harm another in the heat of anger. It is better to proactively treat this problem. Don’t wait until it is too late.There are very effective anger management programs that exist and you should take advantage of them. In addition, I would also recommend attending an Al-Anon meeting. These meetings can be very effective and are designed to help individuals who have family members with ongoing alcohol problems. The find help tab can help you locate a therapist who specializes in anger management. Here’s a link to where you can find more information about the Al-Anon meetings I described above. I wish you the best. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 I’ve been with the same man for almost 27 years, we have 3 children / when we first met he was very controlling always flipping out if i went out name calling etc. Once I came home late went to sleep and woke up to him punching my leg that punch left a bruise for days. when I had my first child he wouldn’t come to the hospital because he was out the night before and hungover and I told him to leave my house well half hour later he showed up at the hospital and in front of a room full of visitors told me to go F myself he didn’t need my shit. when he left i curled up in a ball in the bathroom and cried like a baby because i was so embarrassed.<|im_end|>

 You aren’t stupid but you are worn down and worn out. He won’t change. He has no need to. He doesn’t want to ruin a “good thing” because he is good with how things are. He’s not interested in your feelings or whether things are “good” for you. He’s only interested in being totally in control.Underneath all his bluster and controlling behaviors is a man who is so insecure he can’t manage being in relationship with a woman who is his equal. He deals with his feelings of inferiority by acting superior and keeping the people around him dependent. As you have already discovered, he can be dangerous so please don’t feel too sorry for him.You need practical help to get out of this destructive and dangerous relationship. Fortunately there are services for women like yourself at the local YWCA. Call 604-625-5785 for information about how they may be able to help. When you need support, you can also call the hotline at 800-799-7233. See this website for more information.Write these resources down. Then erase your computer history. Use a computer at a friend’s house or at the library to follow up. Men like yours often become enraged when women they have put down and hurt start to look for help.Get out — for your own self-respect and to show your kids that a woman shouldn’t tolerate belittling behavior from someone who says he loves her. You deserve better. They need to have a role model for how to stop this type of relationship.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 Thank you for writing us here at PsychCentral.You learned that neediness sometimes drives people away to the point where they can’t return. This is a powerful, important and nearly universal reaction. The only reasonable way to move forward is to forgive your friend, honor his need to stay separated and use the lessons from this friendship in your next ones.Mature relationships focus on reciprocity, mutual vulnerability and the ability to celebrate each other. Since these features were not present in this relationship I think it is time to turn the page on this one — and take lessons forward into the next.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I’m 17 and I don’t like to speak and I try to avoid every situation where I have to speak. I’ve been doing this since I was little but I would only avoid speaking to other children. However as I got older I stopped talking to teachers. When my teachers called on me I would just stay silent. Now I’m doing it to my family. When my mother or siblings says something to me I just stay silent and they think I’m ignoring them. I’m not. I have a reply in my head but I just can’t bring myself to say it out loud.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m very surprised that your parents or teachers didn’t address this with you long ago. What may have started as a little anxiety has now become a much harder to break long time habit. The longer we are silent, the harder it is to speak.One of the important developmental tasks of the teen years is finding your own “voice”. That means more than the act of speaking. It also means finding out what’s important to you and learning how to express yourself to others. Conversations are one way that we all clarify our thinking, refine our interests, and learn who we want to have as friends and, eventually, what kind of person we want to have as a partner. This is important stuff. You don’t want to miss out on it.I encourage you to make an appointment with a counselor. In the safety of a counselor’s office, you can start to deal with the anxiety that is at the root of the problem and start to break the silence habit. You don’t need to become a “chatty cathy” to be okay. But you do need to become more comfortable expressing your thoughts and feelings. I really believe you have much more to say than you think you do.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I go through occasional depression and feel a lot of stress. I’m a 15-year-old girl. I think I go through occasional depression and feel a lot of stress on me. I think the main reason is due to me being the oldest out of my 2 younger siblings. My parents expect a lot from me, that means my studies, grades, result etc. I recently got my O’level result and I failed in three out of eight subjects. I try so hard to concentrate on my studies but it all goes to waste. Now my parents are putting alot of burden on me, calling me worthless and the depression period started. The depression period comes when something like this happens and I sometimes even plan on suicide. Sometimes I think I should run away from everything and sometimes I try to harm myself because it gets out of hand. Please help me. Thank you. (age 15, from Pakistan)<|im_end|>

 I’m sorry that you have been feeling this way. It sounds like you are under a lot of pressure, both from your parents and yourself. Have you ever heard the phrase “The best we can do is our best?” All you can do is study hard and make good choices and feel confident that you have done your best. You can’t do more than that. You can’t be perfect. None of us can, but we can make ourselves miserable trying to be. Even if you can’t convince your parents to have reasonable expectations for you, you can have realistic expectations for yourself.You are at an age when it normal to want to please your parents but you are also at an age in which it is important to start developing your own opinions and sense of self. Grades are important but they are not important enough to harm yourself over. Try to take a step back and look at why you have failed the subjects and speak with your teachers about it so that you can understand the situation and take steps to correct it.I’m not sure what the mental health services are like in your country but hopefully you can speak with a therapist about your depression and stress. Instead of harming yourself, speak to your parents about how badly you feel and that you need their support not criticism. If you can’t find support at home, look for it in other ways such as speaking to friends, developing a hobby, or finding an adult mentor. I know the situation seems bleak now, but it will get better. Give yourself the chance to see that happen.All the best,<|im_end|>"

I have this issue where I need to know where people live. If I am with someone new, I feel like I cannot trust them, but if I know where they live, then I am calm and able to start the process of trust. (If they are trustworthy).<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Your insistence on knowing where people live might be a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is an anxiety disorder characterized by distressing thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions) that a person feels they need to perform in order to reduce their distressing thoughts. An evaluation from a mental health professional could determine if you have OCD.Each time you feel anxious about not knowing where someone lives, and subsequently seek out their address in order to reduce your anxiety, you strengthen your anxiety. It might sound counterintuitive, but by giving into your anxiety, in an effort to reduce it, you actually make it worse. The way to overcome this is to resist your urge to acquire a person’s address and endure the anxiety. Your anxiety level will increase at first, but it will soon decrease. Many people are unwilling to endure anxiety and to their detriment, seek ways to escape it.Let’s also examine your logic. In order for you to trust someone, you must know where they live, but I am not aware of any research that suggests trustworthiness can be determined by knowing where someone lives. It is illogical. Every serial killer has or had an address. Had you known their address you would have been no safer. It would have told you nothing about their trustworthiness.Trustworthiness is earned over time. When first meeting someone you don’t know if you can trust them or not. You don’t know them well enough to make that judgment. Generally, if a person demonstrates they can be relied upon, they are worthy of your trust.A mental health professional can assist you in analyzing your logic and correcting irrational thoughts. Left untreated, OCD tends to be a progressive disorder but early intervention can prevent that from happening. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Hello, I’m 13 years old, and on most days, I have auditory and visual hallucinations. Anything from mild disturbances to voices that seem to be right behind me. I feel highly anxious most of the time. I find it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. Some days or even weeks I feel ok or even very happy but then for a few days or weeks, I feel depressed. I don’t want to get out of bed. I’m at a point at which I’m overeating very often and I need help. I’ve talked to both my parents about these issues and my father says I don’t have these things, yet my mother says they are normal for my age. Is this stuff normal or is there a serious issue? Thank you in advance and I appreciate your support.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 In order to make the most accurate assessment, I would need more information about your symptoms. However, the symptoms you have described are concerning. I would not categorize them as “nothing wrong” or “normal for your age.” I disagree with your parents.Your parents are not mental health professionals and thus might have difficulty recognizing mental health problems. A common reaction by parents is denial. Their reaction might also be wishful thinking. Perhaps they believe that by minimizing the problem, it will simply go away.It’s best to be proactive about mental health. Treatment can prevent the development of troublesome symptoms and mental health disorders. You are doing the right thing by asking for help and I commend you on your efforts.I would encourage you to tell your parents that you wrote to us at Psych Central. Suggest that they speak to your primary care or pediatric physician about your symptoms. If that doesn’t work, report your symptoms to your school guidance counselor or another trusted adult. They might be able to speak to your parents for you.You should also inform your parents that depression is highly treatable with medication and counseling. Treatment works. If you can convey that message to them, they might be open to your getting help. Good luck and please take care.<|im_end|>"

From a teen in the U.S.: Hello, I’m a 16 year old girl who has had these creepy day dreams and it keeps getting worse. It occurred when my older sister began living with us (stepmom and dad). We never got a long as kids because I was raised separately as a child. She lived with 4 other of my siblings and I lived with an aunt of mine with her child till I was 10.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
One line says it all. She feels you “stole” her dad? My guess is that she is a terribly hurt person who is lashing out because she doesn’t know any other way to get the attention from your dad she craves. Hurt people generally hurt other people. A starting point for you is to remember that.It’s not true that you didn’t get along as kids because you were raised separately. You didn’t get along because both of you wanted what you thought the other person got. I’m guessing that as a young child, you wished you could be with your mom and siblings. It’s also likely that she thought you had a better life with your aunt than she had.You’ve both had it hard. There is no “winner” in the contest of who had it harder. It sounds like neither one of you had the stability of a loving family that every child needs and deserves. Since she is violent and you have violent fantasies, I’m guessing that both of you grew up in situations where you either experienced or heard about violence. Kids do tend to learn what they live.It’s a shame that the two of you can’t be allies in healing. You don’t need to be competitors. If your dad is a loving father, there is enough love to go around. There is absolutely no need for you to bicker with her. You can’t be your stepmom’s defender. You can’t make your sister be more mature. She’s still working out the pain of her childhood.  If you think your sister is out of line, say it once, and only once. Then let your father and stepmom iron out their issues with her.You could try to talk with her reasonably and rationally. You two were really in the same situation even though you were in different places in your early years. Neither of you had the family you wanted and needed. Together you could restart your relationship by realizing that you could be there for each other now as two people who uniquely understand what it was like. She may not be able to listen but it’s at least worth a try.I do think that you, your sister, and your father and stepmom could benefit from some family therapy. There are a lot of hurt feelings ricocheting around your house. With the help and guidance of a licensed therapist, you could all learn new ways to support each other in healing so your futures can be better than you past.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

So… I am not sure what it is. I think it’s good to say that I have migraine with aura in general(for which I take not-so-useful pills). Which made me think it could be it? Yet, I am doing fine again once there is some music/someone talking to me/a distraction. Otherwise I keep hearing my thoughts and other thoughts which I’m sure are mine too. I answer to them because it, then, sometimes stops them. But it recently got out of hand as they are getting noisier and messier. When I ask for silence it just gets louder. The headache goes better when I talk out loud but I can’t just talk to myself in the streets and everywhere… I don’t know how to calm this down. And I don’t know what’s up. I really wish some quiet, a light head.Even though, I happen to feel less alone when talking to myself, feeling like I always have someone(which, by the way, is always commenting what I do/think(I often insult myself in my head to stay grounded) but is also a good/funny friend), since I can’t keep being alone/doing nothing too long. (Boredom often gives me headaches too) It’s confusing. Thank you for reading if read.<|im_end|>

 This is a question you should ask the professionals treating your migraines. You mentioned taking medication. You might need a medication adjustment. The specific doctors treating your migraines would likely know how to help.In addition, you might also consult a therapist to learn relaxation strategies. These might include deep breathing exercises, yoga and meditation practices. There are many benefits to learning how to relax. These skills might help to reduce your headaches and overall improve your well-being. Thank you for your question.<|im_end|>"

My ex-girlfriend just abruptly ended our 8-year relationship and immediately started a new relationship. Moving in with a guy she’s only know for a few weeks. She still says she loves me, misses me, feels empty without me, but that we can’t be together “right now.” We had a very loving, good, sweet relationship, but it was complicated because I’m a single father and I have had a hard time balancing everything. Often, my ex got the short end of my attention. Last year, behind my back, she thought she’d fallen for a guy who ended up being a conman that stole money from her. She developed a relationship with him while he was in jail. I didn’t discover it til’ months later. After nearly a year, she finally came out of the “spell” she was in and realized that she didn’t want anything to do with him. But that was a huge red flag that she was unhappy with both herself and our relationship. We should’ve gone to counseling, but didn’t. My question is: Is it possible for her to avoid having to really deal with our break up just by being in a new relationship? Can she really forget how deeply she’s loved me? Can she just transfer what she feels for me to someone new?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 How complicated. And how sad. Your ex seems to be a woman who can’t tolerate a “loving, good, sweet” relationship. When things get too close, she manages to fall for someone else. The excitement of new romance is a great distraction — even when it is with someone as inappropriate as someone who is in jail. I don’t think she was unhappy with your relationship. I don’t think it has to do with your children. My sense is that she can’t stand being happy in a stable relationship. The problem is with her feelings about herself.Sadly, the answer to your question is that, yes, she can avoid having to deal with your breakup and yes, she can talk herself out of her love for you. When someone’s fear is bigger than their ability to love, they can find lots of reasons for leaving. I don’t know what happened to her that makes this make a kind of sense. I do think some counseling is needed for her to come to deal with this pattern of fleeing exactly what most women would give anything to have. I worry about you accepting her if she comes back without an agreement to get that counseling. Twice is enough for you to deal with this heartache.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From a teen in the U.S.: My mother and I constantly fight. Im going to break down basic points that are come across during these fights. She claims that when she yells at me its because I don’t listen. But sometimes I just really don’t hear her. Its annoying because at times she just starts straight away screaming at me – her excuse for it is that its the only way she can get me to listen to her; and to cope with it Ive begun to just quietly say ok, this works in that I can show her that I don’t want to fight but also I don’t like doing it because I back down.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 People don’t have to scream at each other when they disagree. Your mother apparently hasn’t learned how to deal effectively with conflict. You haven’t either. Both of you are at fault at this point. Neither of you knows how to talk so the other will listen or listen so the other can talk sensibly.The alternative to fighting isn’t to just back down. That’s just another form of the fight. The two of you need to learn how to deal respectfully with each other — and probably with other people — when you need to negotiate something.I suggest two things: There’s a great book called Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In by Roger Fisher and William L. Ury. You and your mom could read it together and talk about it. Try out the strategies it suggests.If you can’t come to a new way to deal with your differences on your own, then make an appointment with a family therapist with the goal of learning that skill. It will help the two of you have a better relationship. Even more important, it will help you have a better relationship with your partner and children some day.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My brother was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and ptsd when he was 20. He is currently 28 and lives with our mother (our parents are divorced), and is non-compliant with treatment (doesn’t take meds, go to his appointments,etc.). My mother is the only person listed as his medical proxy, but she acts like it is a hassle to communicate with his caseworker and physicians/therapists. She is the only one whom he trusts, but she acts as if she is scared to deny him anything (like money or the keys to her car), although he doesn’t have any history of violence. She is on the verge of a nervous breakdown, but won’t take any action to help the situation, either for my brother or herself. My father has offered to take my brother into his home for a while, but neither my mother nor my brother will communicate with him. I am currently receiving both psychiatric and counseling help for generalized anxiety disorder, but everyday I live with this underlying fear that something terrible is going to happen without some action. My mother will text and complain to my sister and I everyday about the actions of my brother (disappearing for hours at a time, not showering, all quirky behavior common to most with his disorder), but she will neither accept our advice nor consult a doctor or counselor, and we are beyond frustrated. If you have any advice that you could give me in this situation, I would greatly appreciate it.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You are obviously in a tough situation. Your brother is unwell and your parents are unable to care for him. Based upon the information you have provided, it seems as though there is little that you can do. You can express your concerns to your parents and attempt to give them advice but there may be little that anyone can do.You might try communicating with your brother, as a way to keep tabs on him but don’t expect much. If he’s actively symptomatic, then he may not be responsive to anyone except perhaps your mother.The reality is that there may be little that anyone can do for your brother at this time. He is clearly unwell but unless he is a danger to himself or to others, he cannot be forced into treatment. Involuntary commitment laws can be very strict.It’s difficult to witness loved ones suffer, engage in behaviors that are clearly detrimental to their well-being and to be unable to help them. It’s a very helpless feeling. Unfortunately, many families are in this same predicament.Do what you can to assist your family but realize that your power is limited. Continue working with your therapist to reduce your own depression and anxiety.Call the authorities if necessary, if your brother is endangering himself or other members of your family. You may also want to contact your local mental health crisis team or the community intervention team (CIT), if available in your community. They are trained to deal with mental health crises and can advise you about how to handle your brother.Finally, you may want to contact or review the website of the Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC). TAC is an advocacy organization dedicated to assisting individuals with severe mental illnesses and their families. Check their website for resources.I empathize with your situation and I wish I had a better answer for you. Do your best with whatever resources are available to you. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

First of all I want to apologize if my English is bad. I developed extensive fear of having/being on the onset of schizophrenia (and psychosis in general) after I read medical articles on the internet about symptoms of schizophrenia. I noticed that I sometimes hear “voices” in my head, more precisely in my mind, usually when I’m lying in the bed and waiting to fall asleep. Now I know of hypnagogic states and hallucinations and visions in half-sleep state, but my “voices” (which I do not actually hear, as if someone talk to me, but like inner speech in my mind) and closed-eye visualizations of vivid images sometimes occur when I’m aware that I’m still awake, sometimes even during the day, usually but not exclusively when I’m tired. I can describe my “voices” as thoughts of random (often nonsensical) short sentences or words that are usually non-related to the topic I think of at that moment. They come unexpectedly, I feel like I’m not choosing what is going to be “said”, but I know they are just thoughts and that they are produced by certain processes in my brain, even if I don’t understand how and why, and is having this condition sign of loss of mental health. I don’t believe that someone is controlling my mind, or that someone is putting those thoughts in my mind, or that I’m reading other people’s minds etc. I do not talk to these voices because I do not consider them to be entities which you can talk to. One of other problems I consider potential symptom of psychosis is that I often have very random and nonsensical inner speech, which I stop as soon I realize I’m having it. I am also occasionally paranoid, more precisely I get very anxious if there is any possibilities for something bad to happen to me, and I just can’t put those catastrophic thoughts out of my head, even being aware that they have low chances of happening. I have lot of irrational thoughts which I recognize as irrational. I was diagnosed OCD several years ago after I was being frightened for a months of possibility that I am bisexual (I could not explain to myself whether certain emotions I feel toward men were homosexual impulses or not, or whether I like these feelings and impulses or not). Now other therapist agrees that I have OCD but says that I also have borderline personality disorder. I occasionally doubt in my diagnosis and seek reassurance. I also sometimes doubt that maybe I did not exposed my problem to therapist on appropriate way, or that my therapist do not want to tell me my accurate diagnosis because I could be frightened of the fact I’m having/developing psychosis. The problem and anxiety is bigger if I more often think about “developing schizophrenia” ad vice-versa. I can feel ok for long periods of time, but suddenly one of those “voices” just appear in my head and I get really upset and I get anxious for days.<|im_end|>

 You have been thoroughly evaluated by mental health professionals who believe that your symptoms are characteristic of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Though I do not have all of the details of your case, it seems that their diagnosis of OCD, rather than schizophrenia, is accurate.Individuals with certain types of OCD are overly concerned with the possibility that they have a serious health or mental health disorder. Individuals with that type of OCD often focus on what they consider to be the “worst” health or mental health disorders. Schizophrenia would fall into that category.If you have not done so already, I would recommend speaking to your therapist about your fear of developing schizophrenia. In all likelihood, it’s a symptom of OCD. It is important that your therapist knows about how strongly you fear developing schizophrenia.OCD tricks the mind into believing things that are not true. In that way, it can be an insidious disorder because it significantly disrupts one’s ability to see reality clearly. Thankfully you are participating in treatment. I wish you well.

 Im a believer and I decided to pray for my situation. I went to a psychologist, her theory is: I have a trauma from my childhood that led me to look for a man with the same type of relationship I had with my father (a man that took care of me and that I didnt like sexually at all, my ex). My boyfriend went to a session, the psych said he also has his traumas…<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Thank you for writing. I hope you got more from the therapist than an analysis. Being told you both have trauma histories isn’t particularly useful unless you also are helped to use that information to forge a more mutually compassionate and supportive relationship. Being given only an analysis is like being told that it’s raining but not being helped to get out of the storm.If you two feel great together and really love each other, you both need to stop keeping score. You weren’t together for awhile. He did some things. You thought some things. You both decided that you wanted to try again to make a good relationship with each other. That was like a reset button. Once you push it, old stuff doesn’t apply.Trust is a gift we give people we love. If you both want this relationship to work, offer it lovingly and wholeheartedly but with the understanding that trust is easily broken. Pledge to be faithful and keep that pledge. Neither one of you wants to live with the constant anxiety that your partner is looking for someone else.

My father has been diagnosed with OCD Disorder, but I feel like there is more to his disorder than just obsessions and compulsions. His behavior include emotional manipulation, intense reactions, exaggerations, and he has paranoia to a certain extent.He keeps calling my mother daily to see where she is, and secretly follows her to work most mornings. He demanded for all her passwords for social media, as well as her phone.When she comes home late from work, even for 5 minutes, he creates a scene and argues with her. He threatens that he will kill himself. When they argue, if to him it feels like the problem wont be resolved, to make amends, he threatens her. He threatens her with not drinking or eating, constantly drinks alcohol with his medication. He is also delusional in the fact that my mother is cheating on him, when this is not the case. He took extreme measures to grab her cell phone, download apps that can see all the text messages sent and received, and he also has a GPS on her constantly tracking her. At the same time, he sits in his office after work most of the day and listens to 5 hour voice recordings of some type of listening device he has in her work office, or here at home. It might even be somehow installed on her phone, he is constantly trying to find out a possible cheating going on, or even trying to look for lies in the voice recordings. In an altercation, he slept in the car for many days, tried to drive while he was drunk at the same time telling me that the medication he is taking has severe interactions with alcohol, and that he can die any second, even wrote a will.The next mornings he wakes up like nothing happened, acts like nothing happened, and continues to repeat the same things over and over. His facial expression looks extremely different, as if he is psychologically disturbed. He refuses to see a psychologist because he sees it as a way to throw money in the trash.He says things like, You are a ll smart, but Im the only one crazy. How can I help him?<|im_end|>

I’d rather see you struggle with the guilt of detaching from your relatives and mother than add to the resentment from their bullying and your mom’s lack of empathy or support. I don’t think it has to be declared or made a big deal. Rather, expect less from them and continue investing in your own growth and development separate from your family.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

 Hello I’m a 13 year old female from Switzerland and I believe I may have some sort of depression/anger issue. I can suddenly snap at my parents when they talk to me and I can’t control it. I can be very happy and pleased then the next I can be very sad. I don’t know if this is to do with changing into a young female but I have been feeling like this for a while. I can get so angry and sad that I want to throw things.i am usually very happy but when one thing puts me down I go crazy! I was wondering if you could give me any tips of how I can stop being like this or help me diagnose this problem. It would mean a lot Thank you<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You are at a time in life when you are going through some major physical changes. Before you decide that there is a mental health issue, it’s important to talk to your doctor about how you are feeling. It may be that you are having the normal mood fluctuations that come with puberty. That doesn’t mean that it isn’t difficult. It is for most young women. But it does suggest that treatment is more about learning to cope while your body adjusts, not seeing a psychiatrist.If that is the case, the best way to manage it is to treat yourself right. Eat a balanced diet. Get 8 or more hours of sleep at night and make sure to get some good exercise every day. Keep a feelings journal to track your feelings and what triggers the angry and unhappy times. Then identify the things in your life that make you feel better and make it a practice to do them when you start to feel low.If you still can’t manage the shifts in feelings, the place to start is with your mother or an older sister or another older female you trust. You could ask them for tips on how they made it through the teen years. Ask them what they wish someone had told them when they were 13. You may be surprised at some of the answers.Still feeling like you are on an emotional roller coaster? Then it might be helpful to see a therapist. One thing a therapist can do is give you some coaching in new ways to cope. Another is to evaluate you for a more serious problem. If that’s the case, the therapist will talk with you and your parents about treatment options.Thank you for writing. Acknowledging that there is a problem is the first step toward fixing it. Now take the next steps so you can get some support and some relief.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hello. I am a 15 year old girl. Since I was a little girl, I never really went outside. I always stayed at my home most of the time. I only had one friend with whom I would talk to most of the time. I was terrified of what people thought about me, and I still am. And because of that I avoid people, even my classmates. A humiliating incident happened today. After tuition, my tuition sir’s small girl who is about six years younger than me was playing with me. She then suddenly took a leap on the double-swing seat’s edge and was standing and swinging. I was worried she would accidentally fall and hurt herself. So, I went over and playfully hit her leg and told her she might fall. After that she did something which really humiliated me in front of my friends. She slapped me. I was speechless and I walked away. What’s worse is that I didn’t even tell her anything. What’s even more surprising is the fact that I didn’t even get angry. When I went home, I was only thinking what my peers would say about me after that embarrassing and humiliating incident. I still wasn’t angry on the girl.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m sorry that you are feeling humiliated by this experience. It may be that the girl slapped you because she did not take your behavior of hitting her on the leg as playful and she was striking back. In the future, it may be best to keep hands off and just let her know that you are worried that she might hurt herself. I’m not saying that what she did was ok or justified, but she may have just reacted without thinking, not realizing you were trying to help.Nonetheless, even though you felt humiliated by the experience, I doubt it really caught that many people’s attention and even if it did, they will move on and forget about it. I’m more concerned that you feel so uncomfortable around others and yet care so much what they think of you. What really matters is how you feel about yourself. If you like yourself, others will like you too.In order to build up your confidence socially, it may be important to slowly work on making new friends and specifically seek out those whom you have things in common with, be it school subjects, hobbies, or even just a similar sense of humor. You don’t have to have a lot of friends, just focus on having a few good ones. This will go a long way in helping you feel comfortable.It may also be beneficial for you to speak with your school counselor, a therapist or perhaps even a trusted teacher or other respected adult. Getting an adult perspective at this difficult time of your life might help you make progress faster. Furthermore, you can do some reading on self-esteem and assertiveness. There are many good workbooks available, as well as some helpful online resources.You began the process of sticking up for yourself by writing in and reaching out. Keep up the good work!All the best,<|im_end|>"

My ss is 17. I’ve been in his life since age 6. He has always lied and been spiteful. Since I met his mom, he was constantly getting in trouble at school and barely made it thru each year. Now he has school online and only goes in a couple days a week and he’s getting all F’s. His mom has always had a hard time calling him out but I haven’t. The lying has never stopped. He just got better at it. He learned how to lie with sincerity.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
I didn’t see a question in here, but I am assuming you are asking if anything can be done. It is doubtful that any real change is going to take place without some significant therapy. More often than not someone systematically lying, manipulating, unable to hold a job, and unable to have any intimate relationships needs a residential placement to get the structure needed to make necessary changes.At 17 years old the clock is ticking and it is time for you and your partner to talk about what comes next. Him staying at home isn’t likely to go well, and a plan is needed to have him get the help he needs. Although it is not clear from your explanation I would want to know if the biological father involved. Perhaps he needs to be if it is legally possible, relevant, and psychologically sound. Almost always this is a question a therapist would ask in such a situation.Unfortunately, more often than not, things tend to get worse during the transition time at the end of high school. If there is any way possible you may want to check out a partial hospitalization program in your area to see what services they recommend. You may also want to talk to the guidance counselor at his high school. Even though he in school online they may be able to help with referrals and brainstorm with you about a plan for him.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I want to be kidnapped. I don’t think this is normal thing to want. I would like to know if this is a sign of a mental issue, or if I’m crazy or any information you might have about my information.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You are correct. It is not normal to want to be kidnapped. It may indicate that you are feeling especially neglected or unloved by your caregivers. It would suggest that something might be wrong, but I don’t have enough information to know what it could be.People who desire to be harmed often have emotional problems. They are suffering. It could be that they are depressed or don’t feel like they are loved or cared about by others. Wanting to be kidnapped is akin to wanting to go to prison. The underlying desire is to ensure that others pay attention and show you that they care. People who feel loved don’t have a desire for bad things to happen to them. People who don’t feel loved might be willing to do desperate things in order to feel that they are loved.You also mentioned wanting to know about “theeverything issue.” That is not something with which I am familiar. If you would like to write back and provide more information I may be able to help.I would highly recommend consulting a mental health professional, in person. You didn’t mention your family situation in your question, but you might want to start by asking for their assistance in consulting a professional. If that’s not an option, then ask a trusted family friend or a school official for help.Psychological problems are amenable to treatment. Don’t wait to seek help. The longer you wait, the more you may suffer. Certainly, suffering should be avoided. Mental health treatment is the easiest way to fix this problem. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I think I am a sociopath I feel empty most of the time and mostly feel anger or anxiety if anything. I workout and eat healthy only to look good an make others jealous of me. I often envy others and when I’m not complimented on my looks I get upset inside. I fantasize about killing those close to me and the kids who bully me in school. I lie often and usually insult those around me in order to make myself feel better. I have been called antisocial, sociopathic and arrogant by family members. I usually think highly of myself yet I take criticism badly and become very angry or hostile. I usually laugh at what other people would find serious like a person dying and talk about things that sometimes make me look weird. I think this all happened because my mother died when I wad eleven and because my dad isn’t involved with me often and is usually angry with me when I’m around him.Also because I’m frequently picked on at school which makes me paranoid often.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 The fact that you fantasize about killing others is concerning. I link it to your early, negative childhood experiences. You experienced the tragic loss of your mother at an early age. Your father, when he is involved in your life, treats you poorly. Your feelings may stem from a need for control. As a child, events happened to you that were beyond your control and you had no power. The circumstances undoubtedly impacted your development and may be the reason why you feel the way you do now.Violence is not a solution to your problems. It won’t help, it’ll make things worse and it may get you into serious trouble with the law. If you were to hurt or kill someone, you could spend decades or the rest of your life in prison.Having to go to prison would be horrendous. In the abstract it may not seem so bad, but it’s an abjectly dehumanizing experience. Incarceration is the ultimate loss of power, control and freedom.The primary function of American prisons is punishment. They are not houses of correction. They are places to warehouse people. If you want to get a sense of how bad prison can be, read the book “Inside: Life Behind Bars In America” by Michael Santos.You recognize that a problem exists and the next logical step is to seek professional help. Therapy can help you learn to manage your emotions and express them in healthy ways. You can learn to change your behavior and how you react to people and situations. You are not doomed to a life of anger and hostility, unless perhaps you refuse help.I hope that you make the responsible decision to consult a mental health professional. You can begin this process by reporting the bullying to school officials. Then speak to a school counselor, a trusted adult or a mentor about your anger.At this point, you have not hurt anyone, at least you didn’t mention having done so in your letter. The time to act is now, before you are no longer able to control your anger and rage. The consequences of inaction are too important to ignore. I hope that you will take my advice. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I work for a company Montego Bay, Jamaica and for the past two and a half years I have been constantly harassed my coworkers. I reported this my managers and Human Resource Department and they do nothing to help or stop the harassment. These people have been lying continuously about me. First they began spreading rumors about me saying that my boyfriend left me for a younger woman. Then, they began saying that they have circulated around the office naked pictures of me including my vagina and they even proceed to describe my private parts as black and ugly. They make comments saying that I need to bathe. This all taking place in an office setting.<|im_end|>

 This behavior is not only abnormal, but it would be illegal in the United States.

Some friendly teasing can be tolerated in most work settings but what you are describing is harassment.  I hope that the situation changes but in the meantime, I would encourage you to look for another job.All the best,<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: A little over a month ago, my boyfriend decided he was no longer happy with me and broke off our four year relationship. He thought I didn’t trust him. He thought I wanted to keep him isolated.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m sorry this is so difficult for you. It was wise of you to leave the house. Sharing space while the two of you sort this out would be painful.I’m not convinced from what you wrote that your boyfriend is depressed. It’s possible, of course. But it’s also possible that he is trying out what it means to be on his own and is partying with the idea that he is reclaiming being single. He may be trying to meet new people rather than hang out with people who know you both and who have opinions about who he is and what he should do.If he is depressed, there is nothing you can do to encourage him to get help that you haven’t already done. But if he is truly wanting to take a break from the relationship, the best thing you can do is take some distance for yourself.What you didn’t mention in your letter is how you are doing. I imagine that the possibility of really losing him after 4 years is very difficult. I hope you are taking care of yourself and thinking about how to move forward if he decides it is truly over between you. Do reach out to friends and do whatever you need to do to grieve, to learn from the experience and to heal.I wish you well <|im_end|>"

From Pakistan: I had a friend and she resembled with my cousin whose family are now angry with our family, so we separated 2.5 years ago. I took admission in college 2 years ago and found a girl who looked like my cousin. I kept on chasing her to be my friend and then made her my friend. That was the most precious time for me having her company sitting besides her and one thing more she also used to came to me whenever  was sitting alone. We became very close friends shared secrets with each other.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m so very sorry this situation is so painful for you. Without talking to her, I can only make a guess about what is going on. It may not be correct.Sometimes when friends get this close, one or the other person gets frightened about her own feelings. A very, very close friendship can become confusing: Where does friendship end and romance begin? Perhaps she is having feelings for you (or she senses that you might be having feelings for her) and she cannot handle it. If that is the case, she might need to push you away by fighting with you and ignoring you.If that is a possible explanation and you want to be her friend, she would need you to reassure her that you want to only be her friend, not her lover. Then she might be able to relax in your company. If you do want to become more than a friend, be honest about your feelings but let her know that you will respect her limits.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I’m 17. My brother is 23. He has been diagnosed with depression since he was may 18 or younger. He sometimes has episodes that get worse and worse each and every time. One time it got so bad that he tried to commit suicide. I’m very scarred for my life and my mom’s life. My father died 8 years ago. He doesn’t want to get any help. He smokes weed and cigarettes and he’s an alcoholic. My mom and I are terrified. We’ve tried reaching out to him, but he just doesn’t care. Please, if there’s anything we can do to help him let me know. Please. I love him more than anything but he just doesn’t seem to want to try. Some days he’ll “fake” it but other days, he’s just down in the dumps. Everybody is worried about him. Please help me. I don’t know what to do.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Thank you for writing. Clearly you and your mother need some help with a situation that is becoming more and more desperate. Unfortunately, there is little you can do to help your brother if he doesn’t want to help himself. You can’t make him get treatment. You can’t make him stop drinking and smoking.What you can do, though, is take better care of yourselves. I’m very worried about your statement that you are afraid for your and your mother’s lives. Although you didn’t state it, I’m guessing that your brother lives with you. If she feels she can, your mother needs to set conditions for continuing to live under her roof. That means contributing to the household financially, doing chores and seeking some treatment for his depression.Sadly, your mom is between a rock and a hard place. If she doesn’t ask him to leave, she’s enabling his habits. If she does, she fears he will end his life. The third alternative is to try an intervention. For that to be effective, you and your mom need some guidance.I suggest you do a couple of things: First, see if there is a chapter of Al-Anon nearby. Al-Anon is a self-help organization for family members of alcoholics. Meetings can provide you both support from people who know what it’s like to both love and fear a family member who is using. Second, ask your doctor for the names of local therapists who specialize in substance abuse and make an appointment. An experienced therapist can help you and your mother manage the situation and give you practical advice about how to run an intervention if that’s what you decide to do. Once he or she understands your family situation, the therapist may also know of treatment options your brother might accept.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I was reading one of my client’s profiles when I came across the term “trichotillomania” so i googled it. Now I am bothered by it. I remember when I was young my parents would always scold me to stop pulling my hair. Now that I am 30 I still find myself doing it subconsciously. I am generally a happy person and laid back kind of girl. I have a 3 year old son and am married for 5 and a half years now. I do not have any bare patch on my scalp but i can tell one area is thinner compared to the side where I dont pull hair. I do remember when I was young I did have lesser hair on one part in my scalp.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m sorry that a diagnostic label bothers you. I can’t, of course, provide a diagnosis on the basis of a letter. All I can tell you is that what you describe is consistent with what is called trichotillomania. But a name of a group of symptoms is intended to help professionals communicate with each other in order to decide what treatment, if any, might be helpful. No value judgment is attached.Here’s the thing: Kids who are at all anxious tend to find something that soothes them. Some get attached to a blanket or a pacifier. Some bite their nails. Some twirl their hair. Some suck their thumbs. No one knows why a particular habit develops. The common denominator for all such habits, though, is anxiety. As children grow and develop internal coping skills, they are often persuaded to give up the lovey or habit that helped them stay calm. It’s a little harder when the “lovey” is a renewable resource like hair or nails. A mom can’t exactly wean a kid away from nail biting by gradually eliminating nails from the kid’s view. (Blankets can be gradually made smaller and smaller until they disappear.)You’ve reduced your habit to something that is managable. You aren’t balding. You aren’t behaving in a way that hurts yourself or anyone else or that is socially unacceptable. As you said, you do it when you are relaxing it. I suspect there is something about doing it that helps you relax. It works for you. If you were seeing me, I’d ask you to think about whether the benefit of dropping the habit is worth the stress of trying. If you do think so, then we’d work on helping you find other satisfying ways to relax and perhaps to occupy your hands.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I’ve been talking to myself for over 6 years now. It’s only now that I realized I don’t have control over it. I don’t really talk to myself, I talk to people I no longer know and people I wish to know. I engage in long conversations with them that may last for 1~3 hour/s. I talk and imagine their answers in my head and then reply. I’ve been okay with it but for the past year, it started to bother me because I realized I waste about 30% of my day on it. I low-key like it, because it gives me chances I was never given and probably will never be given. I imagine myself doing all the stuff I couldn’t do. I started to feel really bad about it when I realized I don’t fully move on from any single thing in my life (a past lover or something I failed in before) because of this. I basically never forget anything that happened to me because I keep repeating everything in my head and also make up scenarios that never happened. It’s starting to get out of control because it makes me unable to focus, whenever I see a movie I keep pausing to talk for some time and then I go on with the movie and repeat, which ends up with me finishing a 2 hour movie in over 5 hours. I never felt bad about it but now I do because I came to know that’s basically why I never move on. I repeatedly think about things that happened years ago. I’ve had OCD since I was in grade 5 (about 8 years ago), I never fully recovered from it, it comes and goes. I don’t know if it might be related. I tried controlling myself and refusing any urges to talk to whoever I talk to but I always fail. Thing is, I fully understand I’m not talking to real human being and I’m merely pleasing myself by achieving stuff I couldn’t in real life, so I don’t think I’m crazy or something. I just need to know if it’s serious, and I certainly need help on how to stop this because I need the time I waste on doing it. (From Egypt)<|im_end|>

Thank you for sharing this difficult concern with us. You’ve said that you’ve wrestled with OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) since you were a child. It seems to me that since this diagnosis has already been made it would be a very good idea to follow up with treatment. The repetitive and intrusive imaginary discussions seem right at the core of an OCD style behavior.A way to understand what is happening is that obsessive thoughts and behaviors can take many forms. Most of the compulsions are behaviors that can be observed, like washing hands or cleaning or arranging rituals. But some of the rituals may be mental. My best guess is that what you’ve explained sounds like a type of ritualized behavior. Keep in mind that I could be off on this because this isn’t a situation where I could diagnose someone — but the fact that you’ve been diagnosed with OCD and these patterns of thought follow a particular repetition and arrangement with your situation, makes me think having a discussion with a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist is the best thing.For diagnosis and treatment the first thing is to make sure it is an OCD symptom and this can only be done with a trained professional. Typically, the type of therapy offered that is effective for OCD is cognitive-behavioral therapy, CBT. You can learn more about CBT here.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.:  I have been dating this girl for about 6 months. She’s been going through a divorce. He was abusive and a drug addict and that’s why she left. They were only married for less than a year before she decided she wanted a divorce.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Your girlfriend has been through a shock. Even though she left her ex, she did love him once enough to marry him.  It is normal for her to need some space to come to closure about her marriage and to grieve the man. It would not be unusual for her to be going through thoughts about what she could have or should have done to help her ex. It’s unlikely that anything she might have done would have changed what happened. But people often do go through a period of self-reflection and sometimes even self-blame when there’s been a tragedy. Usually it just takes time for someone to get their bearings and to move on.I think you should take it as a positive comment on your relationship with her that she is wearing jewelry you gave her. It may be the best way she can reassure you that her love for you haven’t changed; that she just needs to take a step back to sort out her very complicated feelings.You’ve only known each other for 6 months. Your girlfriend hadn’t finished her divorce when this happened. She’s going to need time to heal from both the marriage and the death. What she needs from you now is loving support and no pressure. If she can’t seem to pull herself out of her grief after a few months, she might find it helpful to see a grief counselor You could even offer to go with her in order to learn how best to support her.You have a lifetime ahead to be with her. Slow down. Put her needs ahead of yours for a while.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I’m very sorry that you are suffering so much. But the reality is that your mother’s response to your invitation did not cause your psychosis, your hospital admissions, or the breakdown of your marriage. Although you may feel that you are right to blame your many difficulties on your mother, it isn’t helpful. In fact, it is only a way for you to avoid taking responsibility for yourself. That never ends well.The basis of any healing is a look in the mirror, not blame. You had something to do with the ending of your marriage. You had something to do with why your mother chose not to meet with you right away.If you do, in fact, have a psychosis, you need to be working with your psychiatrist, the hospital staff, and your therapist to figure out how to manage it. Psychosis is not a disease. It is usually a symptom of schizophrenia. The individual who has it comes to believe in things that either don’t exist or have no basis in reality. It may be that your belief in what you call your mother’s “rejection” is such a belief.You didn’t mention whether you followed up the hospitalization with regular meetings with a mental health counselor. If you haven’t done so, do take that step. Find a therapist who can help you learn how to manage your illness and your relationships.If, on the other hand, you have been seeing a therapist but have not shared this incident about your mom, I hope you will take your letter and this response to your next session. It could help guide the therapist in treating you.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 Often, this kind of problem is actually the “solution” for another more hidden problem. If I were seeing you, I’d be looking for how losing your spoken voice helps you avoid or escape something that is painful to you. It might be helpful to trace when thinking your words were entities started. Something may have happened that makes it all make a kind of sense. We would then work on that.I hope you will consider seeing a mental health counselor for some help with this. Your letter shows you to be a sensitive person who doesn’t want to hurt her friends and family. If you could have taken charge of the problem, you would have done so already. A few sessions with a skilled therapist may help you get to the root of the issue so you can have the kind of relationships you want and deserve.I wish you well, <|im_end|>"

I know it’s a bit of a cliché, but for as long as I can remember, I have felt very different. As a child, I didn’t have many friends, and could not really relate very well to others around me. Aside from this, I was a happy child who grew up in a loving and stable family. However, from a very young age, I felt very feminine. I could not really understand it at that age though, and was acutely aware of what was expected of my behaviour, so for the most part suppressed any overtly female characteristics. I would always play as a female character in video games, and would admire strong female characters in movies and tv shows. I felt very embarrassed when asked about why I did these things, which just made me try and push these desires and behaviours further down. As I reached the age of puberty, I felt something very bad looming, almost predicting the torment that was about to arrive.  And as expected, my journey through puberty was highly traumatic, to the point where my parents barely knew what to do with me. I was withdrawn, depressed, angry and apathetic towards all areas of my life – including my studies. Nothing gave me any sort of relief, I just felt (and still do) like a freak who doesn’t belong anywhere. I started anti-depressants at the age of 14. My doctor initially was reluctant to prescribe them to someone under 16, but saw how desperately I needed help and agreed to begin a low dosage. I began to realise at around 16 that I was experiencing thoughts of being transgender, and at that point many things in my life began to make more sense. Despite this revelation, I didn’t feel any better or sure of what I wanted to do with this information. I am now 19 and am still struggling with my life, and have effectively become a hermit – too nervous to even step out of my front door most of the time. I do not know how to go about regaining my life, as every direction I could take feels hopeless.

A: Thank you for writing in with your question. I wish I could ask you more questions to clarify your situation but hope that I can still offer some help. I’d like to know if you have sought out any support regarding the transgender realization and if you feel your depression and tendency toward becoming a “hermit” seem related to your gender identity or feel like separate issues altogether. My best guess is that both might be true. Depression and anxiety is common with gender identity issues and is quite understandable. Surviving all the typical struggles of adolescence can be difficult enough, but it can be exponentially more complicated when your physical body doesn’t match what you feel inside.I would first suggest that you reach out to others in similar situations for some support. No one else can understand better than someone also going through it.  There are online forums and support groups and there may even be one in your local community. There are lots of resources online to help educate you and get you connected with the appropriate resources. Here are just a few examples:http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Transhealth/Pages/Transoverview.aspxhttp://pro.psychcentral.com/a-primer-on-transgender-care/005870.htmlhttp://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/04/transgender.aspxI recommend therapy for addressing the depression, anxiety and isolation.  The safety and confidentiality of psychotherapy is also an excellent place to explore deeper levels of your identity, sexuality and plans for the future. In the United States you have to participate in therapy before you can begin hormone treatment or gender reassignment surgery, although you did not mention these in your letter.Finally, it is important to find a family doctor who has experience with gender identity issues. You need to feel comfortable when you go to the doctor, whether it is because of an illness or because you decide to pursue medical interventions in the future.You are not a freak, your situation is not hopeless, and I think that once you surround yourself with support, happiness will be just around the corner.All the best,<|im_end|>"

My now husband has trust issues, we have had a tumultuous relationship for the last 15 years, have a child, and in the last year we got back together engaged.<|im_end|>

  Your husband’s insecurity is likely at the root. I doubt there is anything that you can do that you haven’t already done to ensure your commitment. It is also very likely that his dragging up this issue on a regular basis is his way of preventing a more intimate connection with you. By pulling this issue out of the bag he can keep himself from being fully committed to you.I would set a very strong boundary about this type of emotional abuse from him. Explain that you won’t tolerate it as it isn’t what you signed up for when you came back, and that if he can’t quit on his own you want to go to couple therapy with him to let a professional help.This sort of thing tends to come from very insecure men who have jealousy issues that put all of the responsibility on their partner. It is a way of them not dealing with their own need to mature emotionally by belittling. Don’t stand for it.The find help tab at the top of the page will help you find a therapist in your area and this organization may have some good couple referrals as well.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I am very confused right now. I don’t know if I am happy because I always feel like something is missing in my life and I know I shouldn’t ask for more. I was adopted when I was 3 years old by a single middle aged woman, she’s often not home due to work and we’re not in good terms. I was told I was adopted when I was younger. My grandma always talks about how bad my father is and how he destroyed my real mother’s life. I thought that she was exaggerating first but when I met him, he wasn’t what I thought he should be. The idea of a father is not him at all. He has a new wife that said and my other siblings are with him. I hated him more, because my mother died of giving birth and here he is having a new wife. I don’t want to talk to men or adults because I figured that they’re the same as my father-selfish. When I started in highschool I came to conclusion that they’re not all the same. So I tried talking to them at least but still have problems talking to them sometimes. I have friends but sometimes I feel that we’re not friends, because they don’t understand me. Maybe because they have a complete family and they’re happy. I never really cried to them, and anyways they’re so slow so they will never understand that. I always cry alone, I dunno why.. out of loneliness or envy? It’s just that my life is better now than from my father but why do I seem to want to be reborn and have a normal happy family?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It’s understandable that you are looking for reasons for your unhappiness but you’re looking in all the wrong places. Your adoptive mom works to support you both. You have as “normal” a family as anyone else does. Very, very few families look and act like the families you see on reruns of old 1950s and ’60s sitcoms (you know: Mom in dress and pearls, Dad in suit, two to three kids all happy, happy, happy). Your father probably is more complicated than you give him credit for. All men are not alike. But you’re a smart girl. You know all that.So let’s get to your question: Why are you are confused, alone, and unhappy? Partly it’s because you are going through the normal adjustment of adolescence. I know. That’s not a very satisfactory answer. But the truth is that your body is changing and most kids go through emotional turmoil while that is happening – at least for a little while. You don’t have much control over that piece – although you could talk to your doctor to make sure everything is going normally. Sometimes a thyroid imbalance, for example, makes things worse.The other piece, you do have control over. You are alone and lonely because you’re not with people. However shy you may be, the “cure” is to get involved in something that you really care about with other people. Do you love animals? Maybe there’s an animal rescue group near you. Are you interested in music? Join a chorus or start a band. Do you love working with kids? Think about getting involved with an after-school program or some other activity where you could work with little ones. Are you interested in kids with special needs? I bet there’s an organization near you that works with them. By giving of yourself and by working side by side with others, you’ll start to find people who are more like you and meaning for your life.Meanwhile, you also have some control over your relationship with your mother. Find two or three positive things to say to her every day — regardless of whether you think she deserves it. By going to work every day, she is providing for you. She adopted you because she really, really wanted you. She didn’t have to do it. She’s probably as confused and upset about your relationship as you are. You are both dealing with the teen years for the very first time. You’re both learning. Most parents have just as difficult of a time with it as their kids do, though in different ways. If you take the initiative and work to change the tone in your house a bit, you may be surprised and pleased with what happens.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Four months ago I was diagnosed with depression by my family’s doctor. I started taking antidepressants but I they were making me feel woozy and restless so I asked to stop taking them and just continuing with regular visits to a psichologist to see how I was holding up. The thing is my family, especially my mom is always criticizing my life and my choices… I never really cared before but now it’s really starting to affect me. I’m really scared to what I might do if my family keeps this non-supportive attitude… My psichologist says that if they are hurting me I should stop spending time with them… But we are still family… I can’t just cut the connection… Is there any way I can make my family understand what I’m going through? Because every time I try to explain to my mom that she’s hurting me, she just keeps telling me that I’m too soft and need to toughen up if I want to make it in this world…<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
I agree with your psychologist. If they are hurting you, then you should spend less time (or no time) with them. I understand that they are your family but that is no excuse. Just because they are your family, doesn’t mean that you should tolerate abuse. Blood is not always thicker than water.You wrote that you tried explaining your situation to your mother and it has no impact on her. You can continue that approach but it will likely be wasted effort. It’s important to realize that you can’t change your mother. She is who she is. It is up to you to accept that reality and to modify your behavior in accordance with how she treats you. You should never tolerate abuse from anyone. That can be a difficult lesson to learn, especially when it comes to family.You mentioned that your “mom is making you feel bad about yourself.” No one can make you feel anything. Your feelings originate inside you. They are your feelings. Your mother’s words may be impactful but that’s only because you have allowed her to have that type of power over you.It’s good that you’re in counseling. It is where you should be. Hopefully, it will help you to accept the truth about your mother and adapt accordingly. Obviously, it would be better if your mother treated you kindly but that is not your situation. You have to deal with the truth, no matter how unpleasant it is. Once you accept the truth and adapt your behavior accordingly, your mental health will likely improve. Good luck with your continued efforts.<|im_end|>"

Hello, Over approximately the last year and a half I feel as I have become a very unstable person. I am constantly becoming angry over very little things and sometimes I notice that I am angry for no reason at all. It is usually a very intense anger and I feel as it controls me and I mostly cannot control it. It is like every little thing sets me off into a rage and I make very poor decisions such as punching something, breaking something or throwing something. I have punched three holes into the walls of my house and have broken more things than I can count. I have also been having a constant feeling of emptiness, it is hard to describe but it literally feels like something is missing from inside me and nothing can fill it. Sometimes if I drink alcohol the feeling subsides but sometimes it can make it worse to. But nothing else I have tried make the feeling go away.<|im_end|>

 I agree – this isn’t an age thing—this is a self-regulation thing. Each symptom you have identified is something that would be helped through a degree of self control or self regulation.You profile said that you are in college—so I would talk to the people at the counseling center to get some individual therapy to help you develop the skill to regulate these reactions. Along the way I would encourage you to take a meditation or yoga class. These will help you as well.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Hi, I am 24 and my sister is 22, and she has got to be the most selfish person (family wise) that I know. Anytime anyone from our immediate family asks her for a favor she is too busy or looks at us like she can not believe we are asking her for a favor. A few examples would be our mom had an eye appt and she needed a ride home because she could not drive after, she asked my sister to pick her up and my sister of course was too busy because she was going to go and meet some friends so our mom had to find another way home. When my mom got home my sister seemed like she was so offended that my mom found an alternate way home and didnt call her for a ride………yet she told my mom that she was too busy to pick her up. Another example would be our youngest sister was arriving at the airport and instead of taking a cab home she asked our sister to pick her up, of course again she said no she was going camping so our youngest sister found an alternate way home. My sister who was going camping, then felt she had the right to be upset because she went to the airport to pick her up and she wasn’t there, even though she was too busy to pick her up when she was asked for the favor.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 No apologies necessary. Your sister is so selfish because she is immature. I know she’d hate to hear that but expecting the world to be organized around her needs and desires and wanting to be judged for her good intentions instead of her actions are “symptoms” of immaturity.It’s not unusual for a kid to grow up with other people before family. It’s too easy to slip into old roles with familiar people who have to forgive you. But as you are finding out, this behavior gets old real quick once someone is in her 20s. People do mature at different rates. You and your youngest sister have, for reasons of your own, matured more quickly than middle sis.Do keep telling her that, as an adult, she is accountable for her actions and that you all expect her to treat the family as nicely as she treats others. Otherwise, how will she learn? But I do suggest that you give your feedback in as loving a way possible so that she’ll listen. If you scold, nag, harshly criticize or put her down, she’ll get so defensive she won’t be able to hear you.Go about your own business of growing up. You seem to be doing a fine job of it. Fortunately, your sister is getting older by the day and will probably grow up too.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I was laying flat on my back, eyes closed, and all of a sudden as I’m trying to fall asleep, I start feeling heavier and heavier, like my body is suddenly gaining mass and pressing me into the mattress. I start shaking, and my heartbeat is going crazy. The next thing I know, I’m seeing things. Like, dreaming, but not. I can still feel my body, and I’m not all the way asleep, and I can kind of see shapes and impressions of things but it’s all made up of black. There’s no color to it. It all feels very real, and all of a sudden, as I’m trying to pick up a box in this not-dream, I can’t lift it. It isn’t that the box is heavy, it’s that my arms just won’t lift! I can just feel my heart going faster and faster, and my entire body is almost buzzing. I open my eyes, shaking, and my arms feel like they’ve been straining at something for hours. I have to roll over and curl up against the wall because my body is still freaking out. The entire thing lasted about half an hour. What the heck just happened to me?? All I know is that my arms and shoulders are still tensed an hour later (not like constantly, but I definitely feel like they’re still trying to tense all the time), and my heart is still not back to normal yet.<|im_end|>

 What you are reporting may be sleep paralysis. This happens when the normal atonia that happens in REM stage sets in sooner than usual. Those who experience it report feeling as though they are being held down or that they have become solid and heavy. Often other sensory phenomena occur at the same time. Do a little research and see if the information validates your experience.However — If you believe you may have had a seizure, you should be contacting your doctor immediately, especially if this has happened before. The Internet can be a useful source of information, but it is not a substitute for medical help when something is a serious concern.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Just a quick background, im 29 never met my father and lost my mother to cancer when i was 16. Ive always had a hard time with relationships it seems, recently i have started seeing a girl i have had a past relationship with. She IS currently in a relationship with someone else. while i know this to be the root of my anxiety, at first i was very care free, it didn’t bother me much at all, things were great, and i never payed much attention to the situation. it seems to have changed for me in the last week or so, for some reason its like a switch has been flipped. i feel worried, scared, and upset that she still hasn’t broken things off with him. she says things aren’t and never have been right with him and just needs time to figure things out but doesn’t want to ruin things with us. I feel like my guard has been let down and feelings have grown stronger for her. i have talked to her about not wanting to be in this position and that i don’t want to share anybody with someone else. i don’t know if its because i didn’t get the the answer i wanted, but i just feel worried, helpless and concerened, even with reassurance. i don’t know what to do. i don’t want to risk walking away from something that could be good, and i don’t want to hang around and be hurt even worse later. since losing my mother i think that for me having reassurance is imporant, and always afraid to lose people again in my life, so when i act this way i seem insecure and needy.. which i know is undesirable.. i guess what i dont understand is how did i go from care free one day to this nervous wreck the next? i don’t want to lose this girl even though i know the situation is far less than ideal.. any help or insight would be great.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
A: To be blunt, you can’t lose what you don’t have. She is not available right now, yet you have developed stronger feelings for her. Why wouldn’t you be having some anxiety? I don’t necessarily think it has to do with losing your mother or not knowing your father, but those issues could certainly be adding to the mix.I think the best course of action is to let her know that you would like to have a more serious relationship with her if she is available and open to that someday, but that you are taking yourself out of the equation now.  This will give her the space to clarify her feelings, and though it may hurt in the beginning, it should eventually reduce your anxiety and give you peace of mind.  You won’t feel like you want something you can’t have and you won’t be so worried about another loss. Have faith that if it’s meant to work out in the long run, it will, but put your attention on other things in the present.All the best,<|im_end|>"

From a teen in Romania: I feel like there may be a problem with me overall since I never had girlfriend and my friends are pretty cold with me.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 The teen years can be very rough on people. Often what kids think is abnormal is not. For example: It is not at all unusual for someone your age not to have a girlfriend. In fact, only about half of people have a significant romantic relationship before age 20. The other half find first love during the next 5 years. So keep doing what you are doing. Make friends. Refine your social skills and enjoy hanging out with the people you hang out with.Secondly, lots of teens are afraid of rejection so they don’t do much inviting. They do respond, though, when someone else makes the first move. It seems that you have more courage than some of your friends. You do make the calls. My suggestion to you is that you relax and enjoy the fact that they respond.It’s the so-called “weird kids” who often are the most successful in adult life. You are an individual. You don’t just follow the herd. You are doing normal things and feel just as normally abnormal as most teens do. I don’t see anything in your letter that raises alarms for me.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: My parents and my entire family do not think my girlfriend and I should be together. They think there are people who would be much more compatible for me to date and marry. They want me to give myself time to think about my relationship, where really I know they just want me to end the relationship. They do not see what I see. They think I am just in love with being in love and am blinded by the first real relationship I have had.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 This is a very painful situation. Your family is essentially asking you to choose between the people you love. This is never helpful. If you were not living at home, you would have more space to figure out for yourself whether this relationship is the one for you. I imagine it is difficult to think clearly when you are under so much pressure.On the other hand, your parents may be on to something. They do know you well. They do love you. They may not be trying to hold you back from a relationship so much as trying to protect you from making what they see as a huge mistake.You didn’t mention how long you and your girlfriend have been together or how much you see each other. You didn’t share why your family thinks this woman isn’t a good fit for you. I therefore don’t have a basis for giving you advice about the relationship.What I can offer is this: Arguing back and forth with your family isn’t helpful to anyone. It would be more respectful of your relationship and of your family if you would take a step back from the arguing and do a bit more fact-finding. In a calm situation, quietly interview your family members about what they see as the problem. Don’t object or debate or rebut. Just take it in and tell them you will think carefully about what they say. Then do exactly that.If the objections are just about not wanting to let you move on to the next stage of life, then the issue isn’t the girlfriend. It’s more about the normal transitioning that every family goes through. You are moving from being a child at home to being an independent adult. That’s a struggle for many families. If that is really what is bothering the family, deal with it directly by talking about what you can do while living at home to establish yourself as one of the adults, not still a kid.But if your family has legitimate concerns about the relationship, you and your girlfriend can work on responding to those concerns maturely. That can help your relationship grow in new ways. It will also demonstrate to your family that you are ready to take on adult responsibilities.If you continue to have difficulty navigating all of this, a therapist might be helpful. A therapist will have far more information than I do and may be able to offer more specific advice as well as support.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I’m very sorry. None of the Ask the Therapist team is a psychiatrist (medical doctor) so we cannot advise you about medications. I can only urge you to work closely with your prescriber.Take a few moments each evening to write down how you felt that day. Keep track of side effects, including those dreams, confusion and sensitivity. Also keep track of how many hours a night you are sleeping and a general indication of what you are eating and how much exercise you are getting. Do make sure you take the right dose of your medication at the right times each day. Record that as well. Bring that information to your next appointment.You are the central member of your treatment team. Complete and detailed information can help your prescribing doctor more effectively monitor and adjust your medications.Meanwhile, do continue see a talk therapist as well. Agoraphobia is often responsive to desensitization therapy. Depression often responds to increased attention to self-care. Your therapist can provide you with new skills and needed support. He or she can also help you address what you suggest is a psychological addiction to the benzos.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 You’re 17, pregnant and probably scared. You’ve made an adult decision to be a mother. Now you have to make adult decisions about how you will live your life.My guess is that your mom is both angry with you and worried about the future. From her point of view, your boyfriend is in no position to be a father. He apparently doesn’t have enough of a job to rent an apartment and support you and the coming baby. That would worry any mom. All you can see is your love for your boyfriend. Your mom is looking at whether he is prepared to take on the responsibilities of being a husband and father. Apparently she doesn’t think he makes the grade. She may even be right.It’s a great distraction for you and your mother to fight with each other. I suggest you stop arguiing and start talking about whether you are really ready to be a mom, whether you can support a child, and whether your boyfriend can be a real partner in doing so. If so, there is nothing to argue about. You and your boyfriend should get jobs, get married, and start your own life. If you are somehow expecting your mother to be your backup, think again. She has already raised her children and may not be at all happy to raise yours. If that’s the case, think about the adoption option. Sometimes the way to love a child is to make sure she has parents who can raise her well.I wish you all well in this difficult situation. <|im_end|>"

A friend and I were hanging out one day and she decided to tell me that she is part hellhound. Thinking she was playing around, I laughed it off. Deciding to ‘play along’, I asked her how she knew.

I asked her whether she really could trust the words of some person and she apparently can. This was a few weeks ago. Recently, I asked her again whether she seriously thought she was part hellhound and the answer was the same.

<|im_start|>assistant
 With regard to how to handle the situation, there is little that you can do. You can listen and attempt to provide evidence to disprove her delusion but it may be ineffective. By definition, a delusion is something that someone believes despite there being evidence to the contrary. No matter what you do, it’s possible that she will not believe you.You might recommend that she receive a mental health evaluation but you must be careful about how you make the suggestion. You don’t want to be unintentionally offensive. You must be quite sensitive because merely suggesting it may be construed as offensive by many people.You might want to try something like this: “I am concerned about you. You believe in ideas that are untrue and I am worried that something may be wrong. Would you consider seeing a mental health professional? I’ll be here to support you.”You may consider speaking to one of her family members about your concerns. Perhaps they could convince her to see a mental health professional.You’re right to be concerned. Her ideas are not reality-based. All that you may be able to do in this situation is listen. Try to convince her that she should consider professional help. Try speaking to her family. After that, there is little else you can do. You can’t force someone to think differently or to seek treatment, even if it is clear in your mind that treatment is warranted.I hope this helps. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 I have to wonder if your girlfriend is depressed. She moved in with you from far away. Does this mean she left her family and friendship circle behind? Now she is working at a dead-end job 50 hours a week. Meanwhile, you are supported by your GI grant, and you get to go to school everyday. You get to meet people, to hang out and pursue studies that interest you.Your girlfriend doesn’t need your complaints about how she isn’t exciting. She needs your help to have a more exciting and rewarding life. I hope you can find a way to talk with her about how you can help her explore some career options that are more rewarding. If you did some part-time work to support the two of you, could she drop some of those hours? Are the two of you developing some friendships with other young couples? If not, do talk together about how you can find other couples who share your interests. Are you finding fun things to do on weekends to enrich your lives and to give her something to look forward to at the end of a long work week?Wonderful people are hard to find.

 Please stop torturing yourself. You did far more than can be expected and, actually, far more than you should have done. No one can do the work for an addict that he needs to do for himself. You can love him. You can offer some emotional support but you can’t work harder on the issue than he does. It never works out.I’m sure there must be a core of goodness in him for you to try so hard. But this is his journey to take, not yours. He needs to “bottom.” That means, he needs to see for himself that he is losing everything that really matters due to the drugs. For you to continue to hold his hand prevents that from happening. After giving so much, the kindest thing you could do, really, was to stop.Here’s the link to Al-Anon in Brazil: http://www.al-anon.org.br/. Al-Anon is an organization for people who love an addict. They offer support and practical ideas for disengaging from another’s addiction. Please consider finding a group for yourself.I strongly urge you to get on with your own life. I have to wonder if there is something troubling you that maybe you don’t want to face so you stay preoccupied with your ex rather than move on. He’s a great distraction but stalking him and thinking about him isn’t helping him and is keeping you stuck. If that’s the case, I hope you will look into getting some therapy to help you. To continue to be emotionally caught up in this relationship is unhealthy. You deserve better.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I have been seeing my psychologist for the past couple of months (10 sessions) and we had been working on cognitive behavioural therapy techniques.

My anxiety is still something that bothers me pretty frequently but dealing with it seems much more manageable.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
  I am glad the individual session CBT has been helpful to some degree, but it may not be the only course of treatment that can help — particularly when you are feeling this amount of anxiety and depression at the end of the treatment sessions.Ask your therapist to help you put together a relapse-prevention plan. Unfortunately, there is a high degree of relapse with treatment that doesn’t include a prevention plan. I would also highly recommend the book The Resilience Factor, as it will give you some additional tools for coping. You may also want to find an ongoing group to help develop some additional coping skills. Talking with your therapist about an aftercare plan and what to do if there is a relapse can be very important in your recovery.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

 I’m wondering how much your medication could be contributing to this problem. Medication alters one’s personality, even if ever so slightly. I would need to know more about your psychosocial history to know what effect medication has had upon your personality. You can and should discuss this with your prescribing physician.Another possibility to explore would be dissociative identity disorder (DID). It’s unusual to experience such disparate personalities. It’s not the norm and most people never experience more than one personality. Dissociative disorders are commonly associated with childhood trauma. Individuals with DID develop multiple personalities, often with distinct identities, behaviors and temperaments. You might try researching DID and perhaps see a specialist.If you don’t feel that your mental health professionals are helping, you might try consulting others. Generally speaking, you should feel a little better after each session. There should be noticeable improvement over time. If you are not progressing, then it might be time for someone new. A second opinion might be the change that is necessary. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Hi, I am having a lot of issues with my mom. We have always had a rocky relationship, if we are ever nice to each other it is fake. She makes the fighting seem like it is all my fault, and that I do not respect her. She thinks I am just a “teenager” and does not listen to a word i say. She is the most overprotective person I have ever met in my life and I just cant do it anymore. She clearly does not trust me when I have never done anything for her not to, and she knows that. i have never been caught doing anything, nor do I do anything remotely bad in any sense. She thinks I am basically the devil, and has never ever been real with me. She has these fantasies about who I am, and I honestly think she has something wrong with her. She has this obsession with taking my phone 24/7 no matter what. Every night at 8:00 she takes my phone, and never misses that time by a minute. Lately, she even tried to say I get my phone for an hour after school, and then it gets taken until the next day. I am a teenager??? I honestly think she has a mental disorder because every night, she will just go crazy. I cannot describe it but its like she becomes a different person. take this Friday for instance, she calls me while I am out with my friends to call my friends mom and make sure that she is still bringing me home. Its like when she gets bored she just tries to instagate me. Most people would say this is just her making sure I am safe, but once I gave her the moms number– she thought i was giving her the wrong number and threatened to call the grocery store where the mom worked, just to tell the mom that my friend was rude in the car? Please help! How do i make her understand I’m just a teenager? (From the USA)<|im_end|>

  I appreciate you writing in about this as I believe the struggle for independence is a common source of friction — particularly between mothers and daughters. Just like you have trouble understanding your mom’s behavior, she has trouble understanding yours. When things are going okay would be the time to ask her to sit down and talk. It sounds like there is a bit of a pattern where something happens — a fight, and then a lull, then another fight. I think that needs to change.When things are okay — and no fights or conflicts are present — ask your mom to talk. Plan out what you would like to say ahead of time, and see if she is open to it. Three things seem important. The first is to find times when the relationship has been good and recall those times with your mom. Find a few memories to remind both of you that not everything is a fight. Secondly, you want to know what the two of you could do to improve the relationship. That you notice how much you fight and ask if there can be an opportunity for change. Finally, let your mom know that you would even be willing to go to a counselor (if you are) to work with her on making things better.You want her to respect you more, and I think the way to do this is through a conversation you have when you are not fighting. If you need some help with this you may want to talk to your high school counselor as he or she might be able to give you some pointers about approaching your mom.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From an adult man in the U.S.: Lately I have been hearing one voice that is wanting me to hurt myself and others. Started out just wanted me to hurt myself but lately it has been telling me to hurt others.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
You aren’t scared enough! You know this is getting worse. You know you haven’t been able to stop it on your own. It’s well past time for you to get some help. Even the “voice” knows it.Since this is a recent change in your thinking, I’m particularly interested in pursuing a medical explanation. If you haven’t had a medical check up in awhile, see your primary care physician ASAP. There are medical conditions that can cause irrational thinking. Sometimes it is as simple as a vitamin deficiency! Really.But if you are medically fine, you do need to see a mental health professional for an evaluation. Please don’t hesitate to do so. A therapist may be able to identify what has changed and will offer you options for addressing it. You aren’t obligated to do anything other than listen. Chances are, though, that you will learn some new ways to address your feelings of being unlovable and a “loser”.At 50+, you deserve to have more going on in your life. A therapist will give you the support you need while you figure out how to make it happen.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Today my mother threatened to throw my five-month-old kitten out. This may seem silly, but I take these things very seriously. I value animals higher than anything; they are really the only things I seriously care for (cats especially). My kitten is practically the reason I’m still here. Therefore, when she told me that, it felt like a slap in the face, and later on, I felt like the world was coming crashing down on me. I felt so guilty thinking what would happen to my kitten. The reason this all even started was cause I hadn’t cleaned the litter box yet, but I was planning to later on after I had gotten a nap in, I had very little sleep the night before. However she suddenly threatened me and I couldn’t be rational anymore. I asked her how it would feel if I threw out her dog (just asking for her to understand exactly what she was saying), and she took it as a threat and picked up a couple of sheets and I think she tried to strangle me with it… but I retaliated. Lots of screaming ensued. I don’t feel like I can talk to her anymore. In fact that was the worst fight we have ever had. In addition, if she ever did throw out my cat, I’m 100% certain that I will kill myself. I don’t value my life highly, but I do value my cat’s life. I feel like if I told her that she would just take it as a threat the way she threatened me. Just from this fight I am again realizing that I don’t want to be here anymore. Not too long ago she told me that people who attack animals are the lowest of human beings and are probably sociopaths. So i can’t see why she would do such a thing. What should i do.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m so sorry you’re having these kind of problems with your mom. It’s time to move out. If your mother is threatening violence to you and trying to strangle this is not the time to try and negotiate with her. If it happens again or anything even remotely close to it — call the police. Your mother’s lack of sensitivity and inability to resolve a relatively small matter does not bode well for the future of your relationship. I would highly recommend you work on doing what you need to do to move. This may mean moving in with several roommates or finding dorm space at the University. I would also recommend using the university counseling center as you transition out of your house.Often I recommend counseling for family issues — but if your mother is trying to strangle you it is not time for counseling for the two of you — it’s time for counseling and action for you.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I have voices in my head often ordering me to do things and telling me what to do, or they talk about what I’m doing. I don’t feel comfortable speaking to my family, my mom will think I’m just misguided. I am described as cold and blank, and even my close friends have admitted to knowing almost nothing about me. Whenever I am distressed everything is always internal and kept inside me and never out to other people. I have a constant paranoia of getting injured, hurting someone else, being mugged or robbed. I often can’t carry on with things and am distracted. I have very violent thoughts and can be very violent. I don’t feel comfortable writing this and am hiding it from my parents. I regularly tense up and then almost “spasm”. I speak little about myself because I am worried that someone will blackmail me with what I have said. I feel very scared writing this.<|im_end|>

 Whenever someone is experiencing voices, they should be evaluated by a mental health professional. It’s abnormal to hear voices and may indicate that a psychological problem is present.It’s also concerning that you are feeling paranoid so much so that you are frightened about writing this letter. In reality, there is nothing to be afraid of. No one is out to get you. No one is attempting to blackmail you. It can seem that way but that doesn’t mean it’s true. When we are having emotional distress, we often misperceive things.Like the voices, your paranoia is also suggestive of a psychological problem.You think your parents will see you as “misguided” if you reveal these problems to them but your prediction might be wrong. They’ll probably be concerned and want to help.It was a wise decision to contact a mental health professional about your symptoms. It’s the first step to getting help. The next steps include reporting your symptoms to your parents and asking them to take you to a mental health professional. If they don’t believe you, then show them my response to your letter. It’s confirmation that your concerns are valid.Finally, please don’t ignore your symptoms. Treatment could help tremendously and prevent the development of additional psychological issues. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 You’ve just learned a hard lesson in the importance of being honest. At 16, it’s time for you to stop this kind of game-playing with someone’s feelings. Manipulations and lies are not the way to build a trusting relationship. Using go-betweens to communicate only confuses issues even more. He’s not the one confusing you. Your childish tactics have backfired big time and you really have only yourself to blame. He won’t talk to you because he has the sense to not be involved with someone whose words he can’t trust.I’m not sure you can turn this around. You may have to see it as a learning experience.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I have a client that I am trying to help get in touch with mental health services. He has previously been diagnosed with schizophrenia, PTSD, and borderline personality disorder. I was recently told that it isn’t possible to have both schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder. Is this true, and if so what is the reasoning?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
I am not aware of any “rule” that says that individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia cannot be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.Psycom’s website states, “Schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder (BPD) can share symptoms. One study found that both patients with schizophrenia and patients with BPD experience hearing voices. The difference between the two being that paranoid delusions occurred in less than one-third of patients with BPD, compared with two-thirds in schizophrenia. The study also found that auditory hallucinations are common in both populations. According to the results of this study, schizophrenia and BPD frequently co-exist. Accurate diagnosis of either or both conditions plays an important role in establishing an effective treatment plan.As stated on Psycom’s website, “The term “borderline schizophrenia” does not refer to an established diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. It is sometimes used, however, to refer to an individual who meets some, but not all, of the criterion for schizophrenia or to refer to parallel symptoms of borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia. As noted previously, schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder (BPD) can share symptoms: one study found that both patients with schizophrenia and patients with BPD experience hearing voices. The difference between the two being that paranoid delusions occurred in less than one-third of patients with BPD, compared with two-thirds in schizophrenia. The study also found that auditory hallucinations are common in both populations. According to the results of this study, schizophrenia and BPD frequently co-exist, however, accurate diagnosis of either or both conditions plays an important role in establishing an effective treatment plan. While BPD is characterized by a pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships; schizophrenia is characterized by a range of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional dysfunctions.”Perhaps the person you learned this information from incorrectly believes that borderline personality disorder means that the individual is “bordering” between neurosis and psychosis. Under this theory, a person could not be schizophrenic because they have not crossed the psychosis threshold (i.e. their bordering between neurosis and psychosis), a required feature of a schizophrenia diagnosis. “Borderline” does not mean that an individual is teetering between neurosis and psychosis, although some believe this. People with borderline personality disorder display certain symptoms such as mood and self-image instability, difficulty engaging in relationships, anger and depression, “all or nothing thinking”, and so forth. A person with schizophrenia can display these aforementioned symptoms, in addition to psychosis, as well as some of the other symptoms of schizophrenia. The two disorders are not mutually exclusive meaning that if a person has schizophrenia, then he or she cannot be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. From my understanding, it is possible for an individual to have both disorders simultaneously. It may not be common, per se, but it’s still possible.Lastly, to further illustrate BPD and schizophrenia similarities and differences, study.com summarizes, “People with any personality disorder (such as BPD) tend to lose the normal flexibility of personality. They are relatively coherent, and can think for themselves. Their thoughts make sense, more or less, and they can interact at some level of normalcy. Their problem is that their minds are stuck in a sort of psychological rut. In the case of the BPD sufferers, that rut is right on the edge of complete instability. Their relationships tend to be intense and difficult, because their thoughts and emotional reactions make intimacy difficult, yet they cling desperately to the people who are willing to spend time with them. Schizophrenia is not a personality disorder, in the way we described BPD. People who suffer from its various forms are losing touch with reality, altogether. Instead of having personalities that cause difficulty by becoming rigid and inflexible, the schizophrenic personality begins to dissolve. The BPD individual may walk a strange ‘road’ of inconsistencies in his life, but the schizophrenic may walk no ‘road’ at all. His day is often spent in constant distractions, confusions, distortions, and contortions caused by the fragmented activities happening in the various areas of the brain.”I hope this information helps.

I screwed up big time. My fiancée and I have been together for 5 years and have an 18-month-old daughter. For the past few months I’ve been feeling increasingly isolated (I’m an at home mom and he’s gone with work or projects). I’ve tried speaking with him and asked countless times to spend more time with him and let him know how sad I’ve felt. He’s always shrugged this off and noted that he has “to get things done” around the house and at our rental properties, etc.<|im_end|>

 I deeply appreciate your question and concern. Bu this is an opportunity for a more nuanced evaluation, not simply having to “save the relationship.”Your actions speak volumes about how poor of a partner he has been. You tried to talk with him and explain and the best he could do was shrug it off. The truth is you were massively dissatisfied in the relationship.You chose a male whore for a reason. The only purpose was to create enough of a dysregulation in the relationship with your fiance so that resentment over the relationship issue would come to a peak; now it has.Your fiancé didn’t get the message that you were not happy and that he needed to change, or talk, or something to preserve the relationship. While there might have been other, better choices in how you dealt with this, the truth is your fiancé was unresponsive and doesn’t realize his role in this.His actions following this, which also leave him out of the formula for change, are also telling. My guess is that he wanted out of the relationship too, but did it passively, not wanting to deal with the dissatisfaction directly.For you I would begin going to therapy to understand more about the reasons you deal with your dissatisfaction the way you do. Offer to go to couples therapy to work on the relationship, but this would be something he would want to fully engage in to be fruitful.Finally let me recommend a book, After the Affair by Janis Abrahms Spring and Michael Spring. It is an excellent description of both sides of this coin.But this is a learning opportunity above all else. Learn what your other options could’ve been, what allowed you to tolerate such an unfulfilling relationship, and what will happen when those feelings inevitably come up for you in the future.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From Australia: For a long time I’ve found it difficult to make friends despite trying really hard (joining many things where I have ongoing contact with the same people, local things, initiating further contact etc). Work is a difficult option given commuting distance and hierarchies I’m at the bottom of.<|im_end|>

 I think you are correct. Your problem isn’t that you don’t have enough friends. The problem may be that you have set a standard for “enough” that isn’t realistic. You say you have a few friends. You say that you keep meeting people and that you are involved in many activities. That suggests to me that you in fact know a lot of people who know who you are but you don’t think you have enough close friends in your inner circle.We live in a time when people have hundreds of “friends” on social media and where stories in movies and TV shows seem to indicate that life should be populated by many, many people being involved in our lives. It may be some comfort to you to know that research doesn’t support it.You are in your 50s. Most people your age have 3 – 5 really good friends in addition to a few extended family members who are important in their lives. Think of types of relationships as being like an archery target. The middle bullseye is you. The next circle is that 3 – 5 good friends and family. The next circle out is for acquaintances and work people — people you see regularly who know you a bit but they aren’t people you would confide in. Beyond that is a circle of people you recognize from your community or church, etc., but don’t relate to other than a smile of recognition or a wave. The next circle is populated by strangers.It is also true that when we reach adulthood, it is harder to make friends than it is for young people. Adults often already have enough friends and family members to keep track of. Friendships take time to develop and maintain. Often people’s lives are so packed with work, family obligations and personal stresses that there simply isn’t time to take in a new friend, even if they would very much like to.I think you should focus on maintaining the friends you have and getting other social needs met by continuing to engage in activities and work that you enjoy. Perhaps some of those relationships will evolve naturally. But I do want you to know that having a few good, good friends puts you well within what is normal.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

It is a very brave thing to be able to do this and your courage is happening in spite of your depression.You’ve listed yourself as a student and if you are at a university there are many opportunities there for you to: 1. get involved with other students; 2. get some support; and 3. learn new things.

From a teen in Australia: I don’t know why, but I enjoy feeling in control of others more than I should. I manipulate and blackmail to get what I want, which makes me sound like a bad person when I’m really not, but recently I have started to think about and even seriously consider murder. How easy would it be to just stab my parents in their sleep? Of course, I would never do something like that, but for some reason I’m not worried about my homicidal thoughts, when I really should be. I would ask my mother about this, but I’m pretty sure she’d just dismiss my questions, as I have a history of lying to get attention.<|im_end|>

 I’m most concerned that you believe your mother would think you are trying for attention if you shared your story with her. Of course, there is no way for me to know whether you really aren’t getting enough attention or if your beliefs about how much a person should get is unrealistic. That being said: Is it possible that you are upping the seriousness of your thoughts in order to get the attention you need?In itself, the incident with the bird doesn’t worry me. Little kids sometimes do horrible things out of curiosity or ignorance. But the way you remember it does worry me a lot. It looks to me that you are projecting your current angry feelings about helplessness onto that event. Is it possible that you hate how helpless you feel? In addition, you report symptoms that do suggest Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. If that is the case, it could be that the OCD extends to your thoughts as well as behaviors and that you can’t easily let go of an idea once it takes hold.These are complicated issues. Your letter is very articulate for a 13-year-old. That tells me that you would benefit from seeing a counselor to help you sort them out. I hope you will show your letter and this response to your mother. Some sessions with a counselor who specializes in working with anxiety disorders and teens would help you manage your symptoms and give you peace of mind.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 Although I can understand why it feels easier to direct your anger at the guy, the person you need to be talking to is your mother. She has put you in a terribly awkward position by behaving in ways that drew your attention and by leaving a “trail” so she would be found out. It makes me wonder if she is unconsciously hoping someone will figure this out and help her put the brakes on.I realize it’s hard for a young man to call his mother out on something like this but I think you already know you can’t hold this secret. If you can’t bring yourself to talk to her directly, why not simply hand her a copy of the letter you sent to me? Then tell her how unfair it is to put you in the middle when you love both her and your dad. Be clear that you can’t be asked to keep her secret when doing so would damage your relationship with your father. Don’t threaten to tell your dad everything you know. It’s enough to tell him that he and your mom have some things to talk about. Suggest they get some counseling and then leave it to them. Yes, the relationship between your parents affects you. But how they handle their troubles has to be between them.No matter how old they are, it’s hard on kids when their parents’ relationship is unstable. It’s especially hard when there has been no reason to think that there is tension between them. I’m sorry you are being pulled through this. Do remember that the situation is probably more complicated than you think and that you don’t have to take sides. You can love them both.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 From my point of view, both of these little boys are in trouble. It is not usual or normal for a 5-year-old to pick on a 2-year-old. It is not helpful to the 2-year-old’s growth and development to be so dominated by a bully. By all means, set clear limits and consequences with the 5-year-old and comfort the 2-year-old. But even more important, get these kids to a counselor to find out what is going on with the older boy — and to give you some guidance and support as you work to turn things around.Both boys need you — though in different ways. Both boys count on you and the other adults in their lives to provide safety and help when they can’t help themselves.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

It is unwise to stop psychoactive medications “cold turkey.” That’s because there could be negative and dangerous side effects. It might also worsen your symptoms.Yes, you should tell your doctor about your thoughts and concerns. Your feedback helps them to know what adjustments may be necessary.As soon as possible, contact your physician and report your concerns. They may adjust your medication. Be certain to tell them that you are considering stopping your medication. They will assist you in doing so safely, so that you avoid any problems that may occur from stopping abruptly.

 I’m sorry for what you have had to ensure. Bullies are cruel but thankfully you’ve left them and that school behind.Naturally, you’re worried about meeting “bullies” at your new school. Your primary concern is that if you were to interact with “bullies, they would destroy everything.” Essentially, at this point your happiness is dictated by others. If no one bothers you, then you’ll be happy. Your happiness should be dictated by you and not by others. Ideally, what others think or say to you should not matter. You should be immune to the opinion of others.Part of the issue is related to self-esteem. If you felt confident about yourself and your abilities, then you would care less about what other people think of you. Another aspect of this problem is that you’ve never informed your family about the problems at school. You’ve also never received help for the anxiety and depression you experienced related to bullying.You need to be proactive in this situation. My recommendation would be to tell your family about past problems and potential new school problems. They may be a great support system for you but they can’t help if they are unaware that a problem exists.Also, I would recommend entering psychotherapy. It is important to address self-esteem, anxiety and depression issues. Those issues typically do not resolve themselves. They often require professional treatment. Mental health professionals are trained to deal with these very issues. They can provide you with helpful advice and ultimately therapy could improve your life significantly. A therapist can help you to learn the right way to deal with bullies. It would be an ongoing correction of your behavior when in a confrontational situation. You will no longer be alone with this problem and will have your therapist to help.You don’t need to suffer any longer. Tell your family, and receive the help that you deserve and that would make your life better. With the right help and support you have a very bright future. I have dealt with many clients who have had experiences very, very similar to yours. They are all now living secure, confident, happy lives. Please consider my recommendations. I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

 Since I got diagnosed with schizophrenia my life has been falling apart. But the main problem is homicidal thoughts. I have only one friend, close one. He is the only one i talk to, excluding my mom. My dad was a drunk who destroyed our family. He died 5 weeks ago, and I was happy that he died. And i dont know why, but i fantasize about killing everyone i see, even animals, which i love. I fantasize about torturing them in the worst possible ways i can come up with, then slowly kill them while they watch me doing it. I don’t know if the thoughts have anything to do with schizophrenia, since i had those thoughts for a long time. All i want to know is how to control those thoughts, since i start feeling like someday i could do that without thinking, as an impulse. Thank you for your help.<|im_end|>

 It is not uncommon for people with trauma histories to experience homicidal thoughts. Your father had the power to “destroy [your] family” and you could do nothing about it. He had all the control. In your homicidal fantasies, you are the all-powerful one. You have the power to destroy life. It’s possible that your homicidal thoughts are a form of psychological compensation stemming from feelings of powerlessness that you may have felt (and may continue to feel) as a victim of his abuse.Attempting to determine the source of your homicidal thoughts is an interesting psychological exercise but what’s most important is ensuring that you never act on them. By your own admission, you are having difficulty controlling your thoughts and anyone who is having this problem should consult a mental health professional. They can help you and prevent you from harming people. Medication might also help.It’s good that you are thinking proactively about this problem. It is what you should be doing. Until you are certain that you will never act on your homicidal thoughts, you should be continuously working with mental health professionals. In an emergency situation, go to the hospital for safety. They will protect you from harming other people. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 No one has determined conclusively that schizophrenia is genetic. There are still many theories about what causes schizophrenia but no one theory has been proven to be the cause. The prevailing theory is that schizophrenia is a brain disease. It is also believed, by many scientists and researchers, that stress and environment can play a major role in the development of schizophrenia.Research shows that individuals who have relatives with schizophrenia are at an increased risk for developing the disorder. It is important to note that the increased risk is slight. Having a relative with the disease in no way guarantees that other family members will develop it. Again, the risk is slight and its development depends on many factors.Some of the symptoms you have described are associated with both schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder. Anxiety is one such example as is social isolation. Lack of motivation, in the context of schizophrenia, would be considered a negative symptom of the disorder. Negative symptoms are characteristics of an individual’s behavior that should exist but do not.Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by a lack of social interaction and extreme anxiety in social situations. Individuals with this disorder tend to keep to themselves. They don’t have many or any close friends. They are very shy and have difficulty interacting with other people. They sometimes believe that they have special or magical powers.Schizophrenia is similar to schizotypal personality disorder. In fact, it is most closely linked to schizophrenia, when compared to all the other personality disorders. The main difference between schizotypal and schizophrenia is that the individual with the personality disorder, for instance, may believe that other people are talking about them (ideas) versus the individual with schizophrenia who knows it’s true because they remember it happening (delusion).The inability to express emotions, “stone faced or expressionless” might be considered a symptom called flat affect. Flat affect refers to an individual’s inability to show or to feel appropriate emotions.You also mentioned having trouble with differentiating dreams from reality. You asked whether that is something that “comes with age?” I am not certain that I fully understand this question, however, it is abnormal to lack the ability to distinguish between dreams and reality. That symptom might be a reference to psychosis. Psychosis is a break with reality. Essentially, it is the belief in thoughts or ideas that are not real.I cannot determine whether you have either disorder or any disorder. That determination would need to be made by a mental health professional who could evaluate you in person. I would highly recommend having a psychological evaluation. The “find help” tab could assist you in locating a mental health professional in your community. I wish you the best of luck.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I need advice on what to say to my best friend regarding her husband’ spill addiction and depression. Last night was the final straw for me as I received a phone call this morning from her telling me her husband punched a hole in their wall and shot a hole in their floor as their three years old slept down the hall. I know she is at her wits end dealing with his addiction and I don’t know how to help her. He is prescribed pills from his doctor for a work related injury, but he also steals pills from other family members. I have witnessed him when he has taken pills and it’s very concerning. He is also threatening to kill himself if she leaves. He won’t go to rehab or seek any type of help. I’m not sure how many pills he takes daily but I do know it is in the double digits, depending if he can get more. He blames her for everything. I have told her to tell the doctor he I addicted, call a therapist but she hasn’t due to what she thinks he will do. What does she do from here? I feel her safety and their child’s safety is at risk. She has been hoping that he will get better on his own but I don’t believe that he will. Please help me help her.<|im_end|>

 This is a very dangerous situation. Your friend is terrified of what he’ll do if she leaves. I’m terrified of what he’ll do if she stays. She and her child are in danger. I think you should call child protective services. In most states, such calls can be anonymous. Our first obligation is to protect little kids who can’t protect themselves. Perhaps a visit from child protection will be the wake up call this couple needs. He won’t be able to blame her if the call came from someone else. She may get the message that she needs to get out of this situation before she or her child get hurt. You might also research where the nearest shelter for women escaping domestic violence is located so you can provide her with the information.I understand why you might hesitate to take action. But think about how you will feel if in the next phone call you learn that it was the child, not the the floor that was shot.I wish. You well. <|im_end|>"

I am a 36 year old married mother of two: I’m not sure what to say or how to begin this. I have periods of rage and depression where I can tell from the moment I wake up that it is going to be a “bad” day. I get overly angry at little things, and pick fights w/my spouse. I have suicidal thoughts (several times a month) but will not act one them because of my children – although I do not think I am a great mother my son adores me (and I love him as much) and I cannot imagine what it would do to him if I was gone. My husband is wonderful and very patient and we’ve worked through a lot of things over the years but lately I just get so tired, and frustrated, and I act out and just generally become disagreeable, angry and violent. I push and push and push until he reacts – the weird thing is once he is angry I feel very calm and together – and my own “anger” dissipates – but until he reacts I just get more and more agitated.<|im_end|>

 I do believe that you have more than the “occasional blues.” Everyone has mood swings but generally it’s not considered a problem until they are compromising your life. From your letter it seems that you have been living a very compromised life. You are suffering daily, to the point where it is affecting your marriage and your overall wellbeing. It is also likely affecting your children. This is the very definition of when one should seek help.It is important to learn the cause of your anger and unhappiness. If I could interview you in person I would want to know if something has changed lately. Did some event occur? What prompted you to notice the increase in your unhappiness? Knowing this information could help to uncover the reason for your unhappiness.In my experience as a therapist, I’ve seen anger issues like yours among my clients. It is not unusual for individuals exhibiting similar symptoms to act out in a manner that you have described with your husband. They push and push until they get a reaction from their significant other, friend or family member. It was at that point (i.e. invoking a reaction) that they also too described their anger diminishing. In most cases, it was because they wanted their spouse, friend or loved one to recognize their suffering. It was their way of forcing an emotional confrontation. They had been stoically suffering. They did not want to complain and often felt they didn’t have the right to complain.I would strongly suggest that you consider counseling. It could greatly benefit you. If not for yourself then do it for the sake of your marriage and your children. Studies show that children whose parents are suffering from mental health disorders may be more likely themselves to develop mental health disorders. Children who have a parent with depression are especially at risk. Depressed mothers in particular tend to be more isolative, withdrawn and less able to respond to the child’s emotional needs, compared to mothers without depression. For these reasons and many others it is very important that you seek help. Please click on the find help tab at the top of this page to search for a clinician in your community.I wish you well. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I feel hollow, empty. I’m not depressed, but I don’t experience many emotions with 2 exceptions. One being I get wildly angry after being provoked multiple times. The other exception has happened only twice in my life. I have met a girl (my age, obviously) that, for no apparent reason, I feel strongly attracted to, both times I have known little to nothing about them, it seems to be random. I can just & read them and looking at pictures of them make me feel happy. I put on different &masks throughout the day to interact with people and they don’t seem to ever notice I’m deceiving them. I also experienced heavy physical bullying as a child in school and several instances of sexual assault, also as a child, from a parent of one of the kids I went to elementary school with. I don’t react to anything. If I win something, I feel nothing, same thing with losing, watching movies, jump scares, death, surprises, birthdays, or anything else a normal person would react to. Can you help me understand what is going in in my brain? Thanks<|im_end|>

 I’m not certain that anything is necessarily “wrong.” You might try keeping a journal to document your moods. It is your opinion that you don’t have emotional reactions, but you could be wrong. Try documenting your moods to determine if you are accurate.If you are concerned about this issue, it would be wise to consult a therapist. If you did keep a mood journal, that would be a great asset for your therapist. It would give them insight into your emotional state of mind.You mentioned being a victim of bullying and sexual abuse. The emotional aftermath of these experiences could be interfering with your emotions. We all feel anger from time to time but it should not be your primary emotion. “Wild anger” suggests an out-of-control temper. This may be a result of the abuse you sustained but it is correctable.My recommendation is to try counseling. It’s the best place to deal with emotional problems. Counselors are experts in relationships and emotional experiences. Why not utilize the expertise of a professional who is trained to address the very problems with which you are struggling? Give it a try. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I’m having flashbacks of being involved in sexual activity from the age of around 7, the boy was 4 years older than me. I remember waking up to him touching me during a sleepover and telling me to be quiet. I didn’t know what he was doing and was too scared to say anything.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Your questions are not silly. You are a victim of sexual abuse. Please don’t think that you are not. What you described is abuse. The perpetrator doesn’t have to be an adult to be a perpetrator. He forced you to do things that you didn’t want to do and used power and control to scare you into keeping quiet. That is abuse.Feelings of shame and embarrassment are common aftereffects of childhood sexual abuse. Those feelings often prevent people from seeking help. When you think about it, there’s nothing to feel shameful or embarrassed about. You didn’t do anything wrong. This was something that was forced upon you, through no fault of your own. You had no choice. You were a child. You were a victim.You stated that you do not want to seek help unless you are certain that the abuse is the reason why you are struggling. Why? That is an unusual way of thinking. Typically, people consult professionals to understand what’s wrong. It’s not a prerequisite that they know what is wrong before the consult.You wouldn’t use that same logic for any other type of problem. For instance, it would be odd to think that in order to see a dentist for tooth pain, that you must be certain of the cause of the pain before the consultation. That is an irrational way of thinking and likely linked to your feelings of shame and embarrassment.You stated that you have depression, anxiety, sexual issues and are using drugs in order to get through the day. That is not a healthy way to live. It doesn’t matter why you want help or what has led you to ask for the help. The only thing that matters is that you get help.Shame and embarrassment seem to be clouding your judgment. They are thinking traps that put you at risk of stagnating in life. Fight past those cognitive restraints, do the right thing and consult a therapist. The sooner you begin seeking help, the sooner you can overcome them and get on with your life. These are all treatable problems but not if you continue to succumb to irrational ideas of why you are undeserving of help. Thank you for your question. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From the U.K: I have 2 small children, married for 5 years. I am a student as well. I find myself getting angry very easy about little things, and I feel I can not cope anymore with all the running of the household, husband and studying. My husband is a very cold person and this affects me a lot too. Every time I try to speak to him (and I did try a lot) he just never listens. I keep going on about the fact that we need time for ourselves but he is always saying he is busy (he works shifts) or he is too tired, or just wants to chill out at home. I love my children very much but sometimes after a stressful day with them I feel like packing my bags and go. I know they all love me but my husband very rarely shows it these days … He is doing an open university as well so we are very busy but I feel that this has added to more work on my side (household stuff) and him just being more absent. I am struggling a lot, I often think to leave him but I don’t have the guts because of the children. He is a fantastic dad but I feel I am growing apart from him because I never get a looking anymore. I miss the times before we had children, saying this it feels me with guilt because I wouldn’t see my life without my children now. Being a mum, a wife and a student its hard work and I find it very stressful sometimes. I just need some advice really and some support if possible.<|im_end|>

 I think you are stressed and irritable because your life is too stressful. Ditto for your husband. You’ve both taken on a huge load. Work, school, household, kids. I suspect that neither of you is getting enough sleep or enough couple time.Unlike other major problems, this one was planned. That doesn’t make it less painful but it does mean that you can rethink it a bit. You both decided to go back to school. I’m guessing that you both felt that that more education will help you and the family have a better future. But maybe you didn’t think through what it would mean to your present.Is it possible for you and your husband to alternate terms so that one can pick up the slack at home while the other studies? Is there a way for you to get a little more help like a babysitter for the kids for a few hours of study time on the weekend? If finances don’t allow that, is there a way for you to trade childcare with another student who is a parent so that you each get some uninterrupted time for your school work or for a date with your spouses? Get creative and you may be able to reduce the stress.I wonder how your are talking to your husband. Without knowing the two of you, I don’t know what exactly you meant when you described him as “cold.” Maybe he is. Or maybe he is as overwhelmed as you are and that’s the way he is showing it.He may be interpreting your efforts to talk with him as critical or accusatory. If you haven’t already done so, do try to talk to him sympathetically about how hard it must be for him as well. As my grandmother used to say, “you get more bees with honey than with vinegar.”You two need to be a strong team to get through to graduation. I hope you can start working together to support each other and to achieve your goals.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My family and I had always been close until my mother passed away during my Senior year of surgical complications when I was seventeen. The event seemed to tear my family apart and put a “leper” sign on my back. I met someone online when I was twenty and decided to move from Ohio where my family lived to Florida with him and told them about our up coming wedding. My family vacations in Florida several times a year so when I told them that is where the wedding would take place three months in advance and they all promised to be there, I never suspected anything was amiss.<|im_end|>

 I’m very sorry for your loss. Often it’s the mom who is the glue in the family. When the mother passes on, the family struggles to interact. For some people, it’s less painful to withdraw from each other than to acknowledge the loss.I don’t know why your family has deserted you so. But neither, apparently, do you. You can’t “buy” your family’s love and attention by putting yourself in financial debt. You can’t guilt them into coming by sending multiple “save the dates.” Before you put another dime into a second wedding, arrange a sit-down with key members of the family and talk it out. What put the “leper” sign on your back? Does it have anything to do with your behavior? Or do you remind them of mom too much? Or what? Once you have the answer to those types of questions, you’ll know what you need to do.If your family has indeed rejected you, there is sadly little you can do about it. What you can do is rejoice in having found a man who loves you and with whom you can make the kind of family you wish you had. By all means, have that second wedding if it will help erase the bad memories of the emergency wedding. Let his family celebrate with you — both for his good health and your marriage.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I live at home with my sister and parents. My sister never leaves the house and doesn’t ever visit any friends, although there are people who care about her and often ask me how she is doing. Basically she’s at home 24/7. She sleeps a lot and is sad often. She doesn’t answer text messages from anybody, not friends or even family. I have spoken to her because I am concerned about her mental health, and she knows she is sick. She thinks that she has depression, as well as a disorder somewhere between social anxiety and avoidant personality disorder. But she just won’t see a doctor. I have set up appointments for her only to fail in getting her to go- she just refuses and makes up an excuse like ‘I’m feeling tired’ or ‘I’m busy’. The few times she has set up appointments have been the same- she just doesn’t go. When she’s physically sick she will go, but won’t tell the doctor about her mental health because she feels embarrassed and awkward to tell a stranger about it. I can’t afford to have a doctor come to her, and neither can my parents. Even my parents don’t seem that concerned about her, they just complain that she has no job, even though that’s the least of the problems and a mere symptom of her mental health issues. I just don’t know what to do. It’s also hard because she seems to be dependent on me as I’m the only social contact she really has. When I went away on holiday for a month, she complained to me that she missed me and I needed to come home. I want to be there for her but it is so draining to be the person that she depends on, especially because I’m not a doctor, and she is not receiving any therapy at all. When she comes on outings with me, I end up not enjoying myself because she gets very anxious and I feel that I need to mediate that all the time. I also suffer from social anxiety on a smaller level, and it’s stressful to wonder what people might be thinking, if they notice her dependency and us both being anxious, and because of this, I prefer going alone. Please help, I don’t know how to help her! (age 22, from Australia)<|im_end|>

 You are describing a difficult situation. It can be nearly impossible to get someone to seek help if they don’t want to or are afraid to for some reason, and I agree, it sounds like your sister needs help. There are several approaches that you could try. Having a family intervention (and perhaps even include some friends) might be helpful if you can do it in a loving way. You can look up how to do these online, but the gist of it is having a planned discussion with your loved one about your concerns and have treatment options lined up. They either need to agree to develop a plan and follow through or there may be consequences, such as, cutting her off financially or refusing to socialize with her unless she seeks help, etc.Other options might include you or your parents going with her to the doctor, or if you all share a family doctor, you can preemptively inform them of your sister’s condition and your serious concerns. Perhaps the physician can then address it the next time your sister goes for something medically related.You can also reach out to your local community mental health center and seek guidance from them. Perhaps they have therapists who do home based counseling. Or you can see if there are any support groups in your area for depression and anxiety and offer to go with your sister to ease her anxiety. Here’s a link to a website in your country that may be of assistance as well: http://www.mifa.org.au/index.php/en/Ultimately your sister will have to be the one to seek treatment and unfortunately she may put this off until her life becomes unbearable otherwise. However, it does not mean that yours has to be unbearable too. You need to live your own life and let her live hers.All the best,<|im_end|>"

I had my third and last baby 9 months ago. I have 3 girls. I have longed for a boy and will never have one. My sister and brother in law had their first child and it’s a boy. I was/am heartbroken. It’s the first grandchild that’s a boy so it’s a hot topic. On top of it all, I just found out my sister in law went in to the hospital with zero pain and was fully dilated and had the baby. I went through 3 very hard medicated difficult deliveries. I am relieved it all went safely for them but I cannot overcome this feeling of sadness and jealousy. I don’t even want to go and see the baby cause I cannot bear hearing any of the “easy delivery” comments and first boy comments. I feel terrible but it is how I feel. And it hurts.<|im_end|>

One way to overcome this line of thinking is to focus on your blessings. It was Abraham Maslow who said this about the failure to appreciate the good things in our lives: “I have also become convinced that getting used to our blessings is one of the most important nonevil generators of human evil, tragedy and suffering. What we take for granted we undervalue…” He goes on to say that “wives, husbands, children, friends are unfortunately more apt to be loved and appreciated after they have died than while they are still available.”Don’t fail to appreciate your blessings. You have three healthy children of your own. There are many people in this world that be envious of what you have and what you might be taking for granted. Your life could be significantly improved if you were to focus on the blessings that you currently have. Always attempt to appreciate the goodness in your life. It can serve as protection against the jealousy you have described.Think of the magnitude of the gifts that were given you by God. God has blessed you with three magnificent living beings. How could the gender of those beings be of any significance at all?If I’ve helped, I consider it a pleasure to have been of assistance but if your strong feelings continue don’t hesitate to consult a therapist. Good luck and please take care.<|im_end|>"

He is 32 and recently met his father for the first time, we were having money issues, and his best friend is dying. Then he starts to chat up his ex from 16 years ago and hides it. He out of the blue asks for a divorce(no one saw this coming). A lot of lying goes on. In only two months what was to all appearances a good marriage is on the brink of divorce. Now he has realized that he does love me and I want to put this in the past. We will all be going to individual counciling. How do I show trust though? I refuse to spend our marriage looking over his shoulder and checking up on him, but I also don’t want him to think that if he could do it once he can do it again.

 It sounds to me like your husband was under an enormous amount of stress. Not being able to cope, he sought to escape his responsibilities and his feelings through a brief fantasy that he could turn back the clock. He got to the brink of losing everything and then came to his senses. I’m guessing that he is full of regret and doesn’t know how to win back the trust he so thoughtlessly threw away. It would be equally senseless for you to throw away what has been a good marriage in the wake of a lapse in judgment that occurred under such stress.You are right: You don’t want to spend your life looking over his shoulder. He can’t spend his life feeling his wife doesn’t trust him. From my point of view, you two need couples therapy for awhile, not individual. You both need to gain some understanding about why your husband didn’t feel he could turn to you when things got so hard for him. He needs to help you gain confidence in him again. You need to feel safe in your marriage. That can’t happen in separate offices across town from each other. I think you would be better served by using the safety of a couples counselor’s office to delve into your feelings, to forgive the past, and to learn new ways to be supportive of each other. Thirteen years of marriage and 5 kids are worth the hard work of improving your relationship.I wish you both well. <|im_end|>"

My mom teaches at a private school and one of her students kept fighting with others. She asked me to go talk to him so I did. The more I talked to him the more signs of being a psychopath began to show. He claimed he had no remorse for hurting people. And he said calmly that he thought another kid was going to beat him up (A kid who I know personally would never do anything like that) and so he said he had to kill him. That kind of scared me but I made no comment in an attempt to not discourage him from talking to me. I talked to him some more and I remembered that previously I had heard about some kids thinking that only weak people care about others. So I asked him if he thought that was true and he said yes. I asked him if his mom cared about him (which I know that she does, I’m friends with her) and he said yes. I asked him if that meant she was weak and he said yes. He then continued to say that he would like his mom more if she didn’t fake committing suicide, which from the way he told it, sounding like she was going to commit suicide then stopped because she realized that would leave him and his 4 year old sister parent-less. (His father isn’t in the picture.The reason behind this is unknown. He believes he’s never met his father.) I attempted to explain that she just really cared about him and that she didn’t want him to end up living with people that were mean to him. I asked him if he would like living with people that were mean to him and he calmly replied, “I wouldn’t care. They’d probably have knives and I’d kill them.” I asked if he knew that when people died in real life they didn’t come back to life and he said that of course he knew that. He went on to say that he enjoyed hurting people. I knew that he couldn’t hurt me much so I told him that if he liked hurting people so much he could hurt me. So he hit me then burst into tears. I think he’s pretty far down the wrong track but still has hope. How do I help him?<|im_end|>

 While I appreciate your caring and effort and concern this is NOT something that you can or should be helping with. This sounds serious and important and at 15 years old you trying to help may be dangerous — and not what he needs. Don’t get me wrong here. Your sensitivity is genuine and wonderful, but he is talking about killing people, a mother with suicidal tendencies and when he was invited to hurt you he did. As much as I appreciate your desire to help, it isn’t what either of you need.Explain to your mom that you tried to talk and you think his needs are going to be much more than what you can do to help.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

It all started with me intaking a syrop that contained THC, I was told that I would not experience any feelings of being high but it would help with my pain. ( I have pelvic floor dysfunction). As I took it, about two hours later I started to get a Panic attack , my heart would beat really fast and I thought I was going insane and dizzy. After that I had a feeling of derealization, not depersonalization that I did not feel like in my body, but that everything seemed weird strange, and in a fog almost dream like. I thought that this is what THC caused me to feel like (Never did it before). Next day I was fine but I found out my co-worker has passed away due to heroin overdose. Since then I had no symptomps of anything. Two months later, I started to get panic attacks and anxiety after my boyfriend’s fathers death. I had heart palapation, dizziness and lightheadeness. Once I found out that it was anxiety I learned to deal with it. However the derealization happened again once and made me feel like in a constant fog. Soon this went away as well but these intrusive thoughts won’t go away. Especially at night time where I think what if I am not really here, everything seems strange and weird around me. Not as much as that night that I took the syroup but sort of. IT’s just these thoughts are scaring me and make me think that I might be getting schizophrenia , or the onset of it…This is all I can think about, I try to go out and there are days where I have better days and seem happy and normal but then the worse days come too. I also thought I have schizophrenia because as I was falling asleep I would have a lot of chaotic thoughts in my head, not voices but random song lyrics popping up , scaring me to think I’m going crazy. Please I need some advice.<|im_end|>

 I cannot provide a diagnosis over the Internet, but nothing in your letter would suggest schizophrenia. People who are prone to anxiety commonly think they are developing schizophrenia. In fact, it is one of the most common questions that I receive.You had a number of experiences that seem consistent with anxiety. It’s possible that you have anxiety and not schizophrenia. Consult a therapist, in-person, to determine what disorder, if any, you may have.These problems seem to have been triggered by your consumption of the THC-laced syrup. You may have had a negative reaction to it and its side effects may be still impacting you. When it comes to anxiety, it’s always best to be proactive. If you’re worried about your mental health, then it’s wise to consult a mental health professional. They can design a treatment plan to address your symptoms. I would highly recommend consulting a professional. It will help you to feel better.Treatments for anxiety disorders typically include counseling and medication, but not everyone needs both. Counseling will help you learn how to calm yourself when you’re feeling distressed. These skills are particularly important for people who are prone to anxiety. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I have been seeing my boyfriend for 3.5 years now. We just officially moved in together a few weeks ago and are on the way towards an engagement. Let me first start by saying that I do love him, very much. He is my best friend.<|im_end|>

 I think you need to listen to your wise self. You have doubts because there is reason to have them. Throughout the history of your relationship, he has “borrowed” money or not paid his share. Why do you think it will be different now? That is not to say that all marriages need to be alike in terms of the division of financial responsibilities. But for a marriage to last, there has to be a clear agreement and reliable follow through by the people involved — and there has to be an understanding of how you will handle things when circumstances change. (Will he step up, for example, if you need to cut back your contribution in order to get more schooling or to take a different job? How will you divide responsibilities if you have a child?) You and your boyfriend don’t seem to be on the same page.I worry that by not paying attention to your doubts you are setting yourself up for the divorce you fear. However much you love this man, you can’t count on him to do his financial part. That is going to get old real quick. You and your boyfriend need to come to an agreement he can stick to and you can live with.That may mean taking a step back from living together. You both need to know that you are serious. If you can’t negotiate a real agreement on your own, it would be advisable to go to see a couples counselor for a few sessions to work it through. Please do this work before you get engaged. If you don’t it will likely become an issue that will erode your relationship.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From Canada: My husband lied to me years ago and I just found out I have been married for about 4 years but together for 14. As I was browsing on our desktop computer looking for some old photos over the weekend I discovered photos from a work trip my husband went on about 8 years ago. These photos contained him and another women (selfies, dinner together and shopping). I was and am completely furious. I recall right after that trip as I saw some other photos of him with the exotic car he had rented and asked who took the pictures. He told me at that time he got people off the street to take the photos and I naively believed him.<|im_end|>

Another possibility is that you are way over-reacting. Having some fun while on a work trip isn’t necessarily cheating. It may be that it’s just as he says. On the other hand, maybe he was having doubts about your relationship at the time and was trying out what it would be like with someone else. If so, he got his answer. He stayed with you and married you.The question for you, then, is whether the last 8 years including 4 in a committed marriage outweighs a possibly dishonest weekend. A situation like this can deepen or break an otherwise good relationship.It depends entirely on what the two of you do next. If you can talk about it openly, honestly and calmly, you may learn important things about each other and your relationship. If your discussion degenerates into accusations, defensiveness and counter accusations, it can result in a very deep wedge developing between you. I hope the two of you can take a big step back from the emotional first responses and instead talk seriously with each other about what your 14 years mean to you and what to do now.He can’t undo the weekend. But he can apologize. And both of you can reaffirm the value of a shared life of 14 years. If there are problems in the relationship the two of you have been ignoring, this is the opportunity to work on them. If you find that you are unable to do that on your own, I hope you will make an appointment with a couples counselor for some guidance.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I have been with my current boyfriend for 1 year and 3 months now (my longest/only serious relationship) And since I was the age of 4 or 5 I have always had self esteem issues because of my sister constantly calling me fat and ugly saying that no one will ever love me. Then getting her friends in on it by calling me slut and telling me to go cut myself like the little emo b**ch I am. And being molested at the same time this is happening I am quite sure that this is where started. But I would go on diets and work out. And as I aged my self esteem has gotten much worse. I am aware that I am a okay looking girl. But I have the constant need to be perfect. To look in the mirror and be happy. To be in a room full of the most beautiful women in the world and feel confident. And well the main issue I want to address is that my boyfriend cant be around any girl what so ever without me getting jealous. Whether its his own cousins, someones step mom, long term friends, if they are attractive at all I get extremely jealous and insecure we cant even go out anywhere without me saying “you were staring at her butt weren’t you” “you were looking at her” “you sure were staring mighty hard at her face” “did you enjoy that car ride with her tits hanging out”…You get the point lol. Like its always something that I feel insecure about and I have tried to figure out what I can do, looked up so many things, talked about it with him.I don’t trust him and feel like he wants anything with tits and ass. I snoop all the time on his facebook. I feel like he wants other girls. Hes honest by saying he can find another girl pretty and it does not matter because he does not want them but to me it does matter and I feel like he does want them. I am always making up scenarios and problems. That do not exist. He says he can put up with it because he loves me but I cant. I just cant put up with it anymore its driving me absolutely crazy!

A: Your boyfriend may be able to “put up with” this pattern of jealousy and insecurity now, but I can almost guarantee you that, if it continues, he will eventually grow tired and move on. Trust is very important in a relationship and if you don’t have it, it’s hard to move forward and grow as a couple. However, even more importantly, not only are you hurting your relationship, you are just hurting, period. Living this way is not living.  It is time to face the demons of your past and get some help. You list several ways in which you experienced trauma as a child and you are still carrying the wounds. You were molested, your sister verbally abused you, and you’ve had self-esteem and body image issues since you were very young. These issues are not going to go away on their own. I would suggest that you find a therapist who can help you heal from the past and develop the self-confidence that eludes you. Meanwhile, lean on your boyfriend for support and encouragement, don’t use him as a punching bag.All the best,<|im_end|>"

my nephew is 5yrs old. I have caught him touching his younger sister inappropriately several times. I have told his mother my sister and she has dealt with it the best way she knows how. I think a lot of the reason he’s acting this way is because of her relationship with him. he’s to clingy, always wants to be the center of her attention & when his sister has her attention, he immediately wants it on him. Also her husband and herself discipline my nephew way differently then they do my niece. I don’t know if it’s because he’s not really my nephew’s dad, but you can tell it is messing with his head. he’s also been caught playing with a toy that goes to a kids mechanics set that vibrates and putting it on his private parts. I’m not exactly sure if that’s appropriate seeing as how he’s been acting out.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Your nephew is very lucky to have you as an aunt. Your statement to your brother-in-law was right on target. Our job as parents and adults is to love and protect children – regardless of how we were parented.His parents don’t seem to get it that this little boy is showing every sign of being quite troubled. From what you report, it’s no wonder. Your sister and her husband are acting as if they wish that she didn’t have a prior relationship. Your nephew is evidence that she did. Your nephew isn’t stupid. He knows he is unloved and unwanted. He senses his mother’s rejection and clings to her. That only makes her reject him some more which makes him even more clingy — which makes her want to push him even further away.In addition, I worry that this little boy is being abused. 5-year-olds generally don’t know about touching another person sexually. Often (not always, but often), it means that someone has touched them that way. Another possibility is that he quite accidentally discovered that touching his sister or himself in certain ways finally gets him the attention he craves.As difficult as it may be, I think you should be contacting children’s protective services. Leaving him for 3 days at a time is abandonment. I’m not sure what you mean by “discipline” but if it is harsh, you may be skirting around the fact that it’s abuse. His sexual acting out may indicate something even more serious going on. Whatever the case, this little boy needs an evaluation and help.I realize that calling in authorities can be terribly disruptive to relationships in the family. But if he is being abused, it needs to stop. I don’t have the whole story, of course. If you are uncertain about whether you should be taking action, it might be helpful for you to first talk to your nephew’s pediatrician or to make an appointment with a therapist to seek some advice and support.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I am divorced after an abusive marriage–my kids endured a lot. Despite this, after years of hard work, I have two children who, thankfully, have come through all that with flying colors.

I thank God DAILY for it.<|im_end|>

I don’t think you are lying. I do think your approach to the situation isn’t helpful. Your kids deserve to feel good about all they have managed to accomplish in spite of a tough start. You deserve to share in their pride. If your man is to become a permanent part of your life, he needs to be able to celebrate their achievements with you and them.Downplaying your own kids’ strengths is only helping your man avoid dealing with the fact that his kids are troubled and in trouble. There is a reason that they are struggling with school and retreating from normal hobbies and interests. There is a reason that they aren’t setting themselves on a path to a successful adult life. It needs to be dealt with — now. It’s not about comparing them to your kids. It’s about getting them the help they need.I suggest that you and your boyfriend seek out a family therapist. Just go by yourselves at first to explain the situation and perhaps to get some input on how best to handle it. Your future stepkids’ mental health depends on it.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I have a very hard time explaining things so Im going to keep this short. I have a lot of problems with me as a person and every time I think about my problem I just get this sinking feeling then I get angry and just sometimes I hit myself like punch my head. I have social anxiety, suicidal depression, ADHD, and Im pretty sure I have dyslexia as I have a very hard time forcing myself to read things. I started hating myself since 1 year ago and it just keeps getting worse. I’ve been in home hospital since the start of 9th grade because I could never focus in class because of my social anxiety and ADHD, its been helping but not enough and none of my parents are helpful since they cant relate.

 I’m sorry that you are having such a difficult time. Clearly you are suffering. It’s imperative that you ask for help even if you believe that your parents can’t relate. They need to know what’s wrong. You need to tell them about your symptoms.If they won’t listen, then tell someone else you trust or who you think can help. That might be an adult relative, a friend’s parents, a trusted faculty member, or a school counselor. Tell whoever you think can help you. School officials should be aware of your dyslexia.Do your best to avoid hurting yourself. It only makes things worse. I understand you’re frustrated, but you must find a healthy alternative for your strong emotions.The following ideas are not replacements for mental health treatment but may help in the meantime. Try exercising. Many people find exercise helpful for reducing strong emotions. You might also try breathing exercises or meditation, playing a musical instrument, watching a funny movie, walking in nature, drawing, calling a friend, volunteering, or spending time with a pet.Our behavior influences how we feel. The aforementioned ideas do not cure mental illness, but they can have a calming effect which can temporarily make you feel better. They can prevent you from engaging in self-harm and reduce your stress levels. If you harm yourself, then you will feel worse. Make an effort to never harm yourself again and to try other ways of reducing stress.What’s most important and imperative is that you ask for help. I know it can be difficult, but you must not keep this problem to yourself. I urge you to ask for help and to do so immediately. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 Ever since my husband and I got married, I have been very unhappy in this relationship. I feel like I’m married to a teenage boy who is used to getting his way without giving anything back (he is an only child and was raised in a very permissive environment). I could go on about all the details of his controlling, manipulative, often times verbally abusive behavior, but I just want to give some background o f my current problem.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m so sorry you are in this situation – especially at a time when you are feeling particularly vulnerable. By your description, you are not married to a man. You are married to an overgrown teenager. You are expecting adult behavior from someone who sees no reason to be an adult. Why would he? He has been continually rewarded for his immature behavior with money, toys, and the freedom to do what he wants when he wants. It’s a nice life if you can get it. Well, not really. What he doesn’t understand is that he is missing out on the satisfactions of being a successful husband, father, and employee. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone.It’s time for you to stop looking at him and to start looking at yourself. You can’t change him. He sees no reason to change. He avoids accountability by not staying with anything. He thinks it works for him. Sadly, you’ve gotten caught up in his game. You’ve always backed down from any limit you’ve set so he has no reason to think you’ll do differently now.I don’t know what has kept you from being more assertive. If you haven’t been able to figure out how to draw a line and keep it, it’s time for you to get some help. Please find yourself a therapist to help you reclaim your self-esteem and self-respect. Your children need your mothering, not your husband. While you do your personal work, it might also be advisable to consult a lawyer about how to protect your remaining assets. If you do decide to separate, you don’t want to be penniless and dependent for child support on this overgrown child.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My husband & I live with his parents & our life is controlled very much by his parents. He is extremely close to his family & won’t take any decisions unless it is approved by his parents. He is also very close to his unmarried brother, both my husband & his brother are the stereotypical mama’s boy’s. My in laws have a hard time letting the kids go on & lead their own lives i.e they are control freaks & want to administer every aspect of their lives. Frankly it’s getting very very annoying, I feel like me & husband are not a family any longer, I feel like I got into a package deal, my husband only comes with his family, he won’t even move 15 miles farther away from his family. I come from a tight knit family as well but it’s not so tight that we suffocate each other, frankly this family is overbearing & I feel suffocated… I really can’t take it anymore, how can I get my husband to believe that we need to lead our own lives as a married couple?

 This is a very difficult situation. At 31, it’s certainly time to develop a life independent from the parent generation. On the other hand, you don’t want to ask your husband to choose between you and his folks. He can’t do that without resenting you.When parents and adult children live together, it’s very difficult to resist the pull to old roles. I don’t have enough information to know if his parents are “control freaks.” It may be that they, and your husband and his brother, have reverted back to the way they operated as a family when the boys were teens. They all see nothing wrong with it because it is so familiar. Further, if you are financially dependent on the older generation, they may feel they have a right to some say in how you are managing your lives and your husband may agree with them.Please do consider whether the reasons you moved in with his parents are still good ones. If you need to stay there, see if you can talk with your husband about how to have some time for just the two of you so you can be an adult couple together. Maybe you want to eat separately or spend evenings in your own space instead of with the folks.Find ways to make contributions to the household so that you aren’t living there like kids. If you can’t pay rent, you and your husband can contribute by doing heavy chores and regular house cleaning. Doing such things without being asked demonstrates maturity and appreciation and is likely to get you further than having a confrontation. Do start making plans for when you will move out. Having an end date can keep little annoyances from growing into big resentments.Start a serious savings program so that you can afford a place of your own. Limit your spending. Take second jobs or do things like babysitting and yardwork for the neighbors. Work for your independence and you can make it a reality. You may find that once you are back in your own place at least some of these problems evaporate on their own.Meanwhile, do your best to cope. You want to keep things as pleasant as possible so that you can have a friendly relationship with your in-laws once you move out and move on. Your husband will thank you for it.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From a teen in Germany: I’ve started to recognize my weight problem at the age of 15, where most of my peers were already gaining both muscle and bone mass, while I just simply couldn’t gain none of the two. During the years, it became more and more obvious that I’m underweight. My body became skinny to the point where there is a thigh gap between my legs, my ribs are visible along my heartbeat (my skin on the stomach moves as my heart beats) and worse of them all: my arms are like twigs.<|im_end|>

This is a complicated story so bear with me. I was 12 years old when this happened. It was the beginning of seventh grade, and I had noticed my friends had started cutting as means of attention. This was just a lot to take at night and I wanted to escape this world that they were in, so i started sneaking out of the house and walking around the neighborhood before my parents woke up. On one of these walks a car pulled up to me. The driver’s name was Amber. She was 21. she would become my “girlfriend” of sorts. with her was a man named sam. he was 19. i had hung out with amber sam and their friends for months. One april night we were all drunk around a campfire. Sam had brought me into the woods away from everywhere else. I knew he had raped me, but i cant remember the sequence of events (I only learned about the event because it was videotaped by one of amber’s friends) She sent me home and told me never to come out and walk the streets again. I promised her, went home and went to bed. Fast forward to now. I have a boyfriend right now and i have lots of relationship issues with him because I get very defensive around men, esspecially those closest to me. But the thing is, i love sex. the act the feel and just beijng with another person. Im so confused at why my boyfriend doesnt want to have sex with me. Does he not love me? Ive always thought intercourse was the only real kind of love. I habve cut, i do drink and i am a smoker. Can you please help me understand my situation?? I thought rape victims were supposed to resent sex..and how can i reconnect with my boyfriend??<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I am sorry for the trauma you have endured. I can imagine how difficult it has been for you. The fact that the rape was videotaped is disturbing. The videotape could be important evidence in a court of law. I would recommend consulting with law enforcement officials regarding what legal recourse you may have.You mentioned that the rape occurred while you were intoxicated. I am concerned with your drinking. I am also concerned that you have yet to seek psychological help for the rape, and you are cutting. Drinking and cutting are signs of emotional instability.You are confusing sex and love. This is not uncommon especially at your age. You have a need to both express love and to receive love. It is an important part of human nature. Sex can and often does occur outside of love. People can have sex with someone whom they not only do not know well but with someone whose name they do not know. “One night stand” is an expression that fits this behavior.Love builds slowly and exceeds all things including sex. You stated that you have “always thought intercourse was the only real kind of love.” You can have intercourse with someone you love, or do not, but you cannot produce love through intercourse.Sex can exist outside a relationship. Love can only come from within a relationship. You state that you are having relationship problems. I would recommend that you begin counseling to help you with relationships. It is all very confusing but a good therapist will be a valuable asset in helping you to both understand and function successfully in a relationship.There are many reasons why your boyfriend would not want to have sex at this time in your relationship. Perhaps he is confused, afraid, or simply wants to wait. You should not see this as an indication that he does not love you.If I can help in any other way, please do not hesitate to write back.<|im_end|>"

I’ve always had homicidal/suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember, but i never spent too much time thinking about them until recently. Since I turned 14, I’ve been thinking a lot more about homicide/suicide, and I’ve been having urges to do it as well. Of course I haven’t acted on these thoughts yet, but they’re getting harder to ignore. I know this isn’t normal, or right, but I’ve been wanting to kill someone recently, and in very graphic ways, even thinking of torturing them before I do it. The people in question are usually people I have a dislike or even hatred towards. I’m scared that I might enact on these thoughts and hurt someone, or worst. I also think of killing myself in very graphic, and usually painful, ways. I don’t want to do these things, but they’re getting harder to ignore. I tried to bring this up to my parents, but they refuse to take me to see a therapist because “they’ll take me away and put me in a mental hospital.” I really don’t know what to do.<|im_end|>

 I do sympathize. This is what an intractable depression looks like. You are doing everything you’ve been asked to do and nothing seems to help. You say you are sick of being you. But it sounds like your family isn’t. They love and support you. To me, that means that there is much more to you than your depression. I’m very glad for their sake and yours that you are resisting the thoughts of suicide.If your therapist is truly out of ideas, it may be time for the two of you to call in another therapist as a “consultant”. Sometimes new eyes on a situation can make a huge difference.This is not to be understood as a negative comment on your therapist. He or she may be excellent. But each of us therapists has our own training and has our own unique history of experience with many different people and situations. A new therapist just might have had experience with a former client that would be helpful to you. Ask your therapist to consider inviting a colleague or two to some of your sessions.I also suggest that you join a forum here at PsychCentral. People from all over the world offer help and support to each other. Click on the “find help” tab on the homepage. Then click on “forums and support groups”.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

For the past couple of months, the relationship with my mother has started to fall apart, due to a lie I told back in February , which I took full responsibility for and I am aware that hiding my depression from her and the fact that I was seeing a physiologist without her knowing was not okay, but I felt as if she wouldn’t understand, because she’s always told me I make a big deal out of everything and that I want to make it seem like I’m a victim when I cry, so I was ashamed to tell her and face her criticism. As of lately I have returned with my ex boyfriend, we separated previously about a month ago because I wanted time to focus on myself and When we argued it was very hard on me because I was at a vulnerable stage, Due to me being sensitive my mother would see me cry and she would immediately assume that my boyfriend was at fault, she assumes it was because of him that I fell depressed and she assumed that because of him I chose to take a break from school to better my mental health. Now that I am back with him, she blames me every single day for choosing to ruin my life, she blames me for causing her pain and she blames me for my family falling apart. It’s gotten to the point where I’m scared to go home due to the criticism I’ll have to face from her. She bases her opinions of my boyfriend based on some text messages she read, because she literally stole my phone and figured out my password, she crossed the line and invaded my privacy. She is now making me choose between my boyfriend or them, and honestly if she thinks that my boyfriend is the one hurting me she is very wrong, I love her very dearly but now the only one causing me pain when I’m already feeling helpless is her. The other day she even ran away from my house for a straight two hours making me worry, and when she came back she threatened me and my 14 year old sister saying she was going to leave us because she’s tired of living in this stupid country with two daughters who are a disappointment who use her and don’t appreciate her (AND THAT IS NOT TRUE)<|im_end|>

There are two possibilities that could help: one would be moving out and the second would be asking her to participate in family therapy.At 19, you’re an adult. However, you may not be ready or able to leave at this time. Unfortunately, in that case you’re likely going to have to follow her rules whether you agree with them or not. She has a lot of input into your life and that will likely continue should you continue living at her home. That’s is simply the reality of the situation.Regarding the second option, you might ask her if she would be willing to participate in therapy. Depending on the nature and the complexity of the problems, the two of you could go together or the family can attend as a group. Discuss this with your psychologist. They may have ideas about how to approach your mother regarding therapy.Until you become more independent or come to some other resolution, the power struggle may persist. In the meantime, try to keep your distance from your mother, if possible. Understandably, that may be difficult given that the two of you live in the same home. In all likelihood, she is worried about your life choices and is trying to prevent you from making mistakes. Her intentions are probably good but she is struggling with how to best express herself. Best of luck to you. Thank you for your question.<|im_end|>"

 I appreciate your letter and hope I can offer some perspective.You most likely cheated on her because the relationship was not fulfilling. You need to be more direct about your disappointments and concerns if the two of you are going to continue. In fact, this will be important in any future relationship. Tell her that her behavior toward you is not acceptable, and that you cheated because you weren’t happy with her. Then be clear about what the lack of happiness with her was about.You need to develop a clear, strong voice so you don’t have to act out through an affair.But be prepared to walk away from the relationship if you don’t have an equal partner. Until you have a voice to explain your disappointments, you won’t have a relationship that is balanced. A couples therapist may help. The find help tab at the top of the page will give you information for one in your area.Couples need time to heal after an affair, but understanding the root cause and healing that is what is most important for the future.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

 Thank you for asking this important question and allowing yourself to be vulnerable in the process.Your stress level is probably adding to the problem. I would encourage you to engage in physical activities to help you manage stress at a core level. Yoga, walking, any form of exercise would be helpful in helping you dissipate some of the excess stress and anxiety.Secondly I would find ways to identify the feelings you’re having by being able to talk to a counselor, a member of the clergy, or close friends.Finally, I would make sure you are physically okay and have a complete physical. Sometimes there can be underlying medical issues that can be adding to the stress.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I’m sure this is scary. Your girlfriend is very lucky to have such a caring person as you in her life. But it is only normal for relationships that start so early to end.  You have both grown and changed since you were only 14.  One of the most important tasks of the teen years is to “try on” different relationships  by spending time with a number of different people. It is only by letting yourself get close to others that you can find who will be the best “fit” for you for the long-term.It’s not healthy or appropriate for you to be held hostage by your girlfriend’s  threats to hurt herself. But it is definitely a serious concern. The best way to help her and to extricate yourself is to ask her parents or a teacher or another adult you trust to assist. You can then turn responsibility for her over to someone who can help her deal with a break-up. It is not a betrayal of her trust to do so (even though she may accuse you of doing so). The rules of confidentiality (whether to a friend or a professional) don’t apply when someone is talking about self-harm and suicide.My guess is that her dependence on you is due to her fears about being alone. That suggests a shaky self-esteem and perhaps a significant lack of coping skills. She is avoiding dealing with those problems by leaning on you. An adult who loves her can help her either address those issues directly or get into therapy.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 If you believe in reincarnation, then you may want to read the work of Dr. Brian Weiss. He has written many books about the subject. With regard to living a difficult life, Dr. Weiss said the following: “Sometimes a soul chooses a particularly challenging lifetime in order to accelerate its spiritual progress, or as an act of love to help, guide, and nourish others who are also going through a similarly difficult lifetime. A hard life is not a punishment, but rather an opportunity.”Dr. Viktor Frankl, a psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor, believes that struggling in life is the norm rather than the exception. Expect to suffer, learn effective ways of coping with it and attempt to find meaning in that suffering. Dr. Frankl also suggested that one should, if possible, attempt to utilize negative life struggles in positive ways. He referred to this concept as tragic optimism. Tragic optimism essentially means turning something negative into something positive.It is not fair that you have had a difficult life but you have a choice in this situation. You have free will. You can decide to receive help for the various problems with which you’ve struggled. The choice is yours. Gaining the proper mental health assistance is your opportunity to turn something negative into something positive.You asked whether or not I believe that you can “get better.” I believe it is possible and likely, with the right help and I mean that with all sincerity. As you stated, you have yet to access any mental health assistance. Essentially, you have yet to give yourself a chance. There is a great deal of hope for you.Schedule an appointment with a mental health professional. Report your symptoms and your concerns. By accessing help, you are beginning the process of healing. I hope that you’re able to find the help that you desire.<|im_end|>"

My best friend had a terrible car accident 4 months ago with serious brain damage and head injuries, all the doctors said he would not make it, they said they are only waiting for him to die or stay in coma, and that there is nothing left to do. At that time i was absolutely devastated and had a really hard time. He was in a coma for about a month, however after a few successful surgeries he started waking up, and against all odds he survived. Injuries he suffered were great, but now, after 4 months, he is slowly recovering, he learned how to walk again, he recognizes his family and me, his long-term memory is more or less ok. However, his short-term memory is pretty bad, and because of the accident he cant open his eyes, and it is not sure whether he will be able to see again in his life. We are best friends from college, I live in Slovakia, he lives in Czech republic, so we were able to see each other only when in school, but we were always together, whether in school or when we were going out to bars etc. He is recovering in Czech republic, I am currently living in Slovakia, so I cannot see him that often. The problem is, i thought i got use to the fact that he is no longer going to school with me and that I am not seeing him regularly. However, he likes to talk on the phone (of course he is confused some times), and whenever his family calls me and I talk to them and to him, I start to shiver, shake, suddenly I am feeling cold and it takes my body about half an hour to relax. This is nothing serious, but I thought I am over the anxiety of him being hurt or dying, he is recovering and with each day he is getting better. But just a few days ago, when his family called me (after nearly a month or so), I immediately started to shake and experience these feelings again. I would like to know what to do, or how to get over this anxiety, i want to be helpful to my friend, and not feel this weak whenever I talk to him. Thank you<|im_end|>

 Your anxiety associated with your injured friend does not make you weak. That line of thinking is problematic because it reinforces the all too common narrative that psychological distress is a sign of weakness, shame and embarrassment. To be shaken by the trauma of your friend makes you human and it shows that you care. Someone you deeply care about was severely injured in a serious accident. It was unexpected and proof that our lives can change in an instant. Psychologically, that realization can be difficult to manage.Your symptoms may be indicative of secondary trauma. Secondary trauma involves an indirect exposure to trauma through hearing the first-hand account or narrative of a traumatic event. Simply hearing about the traumatic event can cause symptoms and reactions that are very similar to or even mimic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Treatments for secondary trauma often involves sharing the story of what happened and talk therapy.It would be helpful to learn more about compassion fatigue, vicarious trauma and self-care. Books on the subject can educate you about day-to-day activities that may help to relieve your stress. I would also recommend counseling for learning relaxation and other techniques to assist with your anxious reactions. Choose a therapist who specializes in trauma survivors. You may only need a few sessions to decrease your symptoms. Good luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From a teen guy in the Channel Islands: So, I just wondered in your professional opinion if it is either maybe me going crazy or if there may be a chance (obviously I know there’s always a chance), but if there maybe an actual high likelihood my sister may be sociopathic. I think its important to note that I’ve looked at quite a few signs, but haven’t been able to come to a conclusion for years now.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I don’t have enough information to know if your sister is sociopathic. I do know that regardless of whatever label you put on it, you have good reason to be afraid of her. Her behavior toward you is more serious than the usual sibling rivalry. People who are as temperamental as you describe her are often using their changing moods to control those around them. Ironically, it is often because they are insecure.It probably isn’t all that helpful to try to define a diagnosis. If you want a relationship with her, you are old enough now to attempt to have an honest talk with her about the effect of her past behaviors and how to move forward. You will be more successful in such an attempt if you resist the temptation to blame and shame and instead focus on what you want from her now.If she continues to be volatile and isn’t interested in talking, there isn’t much you can do except to stay away from her as best you can. There is no need for you to put up with abusive behaviors just because she is your sister.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 For some people, the existence of the child from a former relationship is a constant reminder that their partner once had another lover and another life. They would like to erase that past but can’t due to the presence of the child. On a more primitive level, male animals often won’t accept the offspring of other males and drive them out of the herd in an instinctive effort to only pass on their own bloodline.People can and do get past that primitive behavior and open their hearts and minds to children who are not their own biological kids. All this is a long way around to saying that I think that the problem here is that your husband hasn’t adopted your son. He may not be aware of it, but his behavior seems to show that he’s trying to drive him from the herd. Of course your son knows it and is hurt by it.Your husband needs help understanding the need for an “adoption” to take place. I’m not talking about a legal adoption. Your son does have an involved biological dad. But there is room for the boy to have two men in his life who care about him, teach him, and help him develop into all he can be.Rather than be angry at your husband, try to have a conversation with him about what it is that gets in his way of being a positive role model and caring adult in your son’s life. Is there something you or your ex is doing that is an obstacle? Has he really thought about his role as being important to the boy’s self-esteem and growth? Has he embraced the fact that the boy is related to him by blood in that he is his sons’ brother?If that conversation becomes too difficult, I hope you will try some couples counseling before you visit a lawyer. This is not an uncommon problem. It can usually be addressed so that all relationships in the family improve.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 Your situation shares common feelings associated with depression, but no diagnosis of depression can be performed online or in any other way except for an in person consultation with a mental health professional.What we can say is that you are “unhappy.” A more accurate way to state that, is that your life at this time is not bringing you pleasure or contentment. It once did but it no longer does. Carl Jung, perhaps the world’s greatest psychoanalyst, talks about living a meaningful existence and Abraham Maslow, perhaps the world’s most underrated thinker, believes that the sole purpose of life is living a meaningful existence. Failure to do so, according to both men, will lead to unhappiness and much worse. They would explain your feelings as one’s that you would expect from the failure to live in a meaningful way. The existentialists would say that you are not living an “authentic existence.”If they are right, the good news is that you can easily achieve a meaningful existence and its’ resultant happiness, by actively pursuing the things that are meaningful to you. Put simply, you need to do those things that you desire to do. I once worked with a radiologist that had achieved great success in life, was the head of his own medical Corporation and whose income was in the multimillion dollar range. According to him, he had everything; respect, money, a loving wife and successful children. Yet, he wasn’t happy even after having achieved every goal he felt was of value. He had everything that society had told him was of importance. However, he did not have happiness. If we hit fast-forward… he did achieve happiness and it came from restructuring his list of things of value.We are all different, none of us are the same. What was right for your father, your brother, what is right for your sister, none of these may be right for you. The course they took is likely not your course. If your family cannot tell you what is right for you, and they cannot, then certainly your culture cannot. Your path is your own and you must be brave enough to walk that path without the support and encouragement of family or friends. Jung and Maslow would say that for almost everyone who is unhappy, a course correction is needed.Many people, who are unhappy and perhaps in need of a course correction, turn to drugs both legal and illegal, to feel better. They are “self-medicating.” When the drugs wear off, they feel just as bad and most likely worse, than before they took the drugs. Self-medication is not the answer. A good therapist will help you by simply helping you find your correct direction, your life’s course. Reading Jung and Maslow will help and perhaps that will be sufficient. If not, try counseling.When dealing with a situation like yours, here’s my advice for picking the right therapist. Admittedly, there are those who would disagree with me and perhaps they are right but I can promise you that what I’m about to say is my most sincere belief. If you find a therapist, who after listening to your life’s description, tells you everything is good and you “should be happy” … find a new therapist. Find a therapist who after listening to all of your life’s accomplishments, tells you that what you have achieved may have produced happiness for some but obviously, not for you. It was the right course, for some. It was the wrong course for you. Perhaps, you have chosen the wrong course. Perhaps, it’s just that simple.Never doubt the existence of your “right” course. It exists for you and for everyone. Good luck my friend.<|im_end|>"

 I have been married to my husband for 5 years…and we have 2 kids together. Recently, I discovered that he was on the computer looking up his ex girl friend’s web page. He was engaged to his ex girlfriend for 3 years and then he discovered she was cheating on him and they split up. My husband tried his best to get her back but I guess she did not want to come back and decided it was over. However they both wrote emails to each other, even while my husband and I were dating. Now she is married to some other guy. My husband had saved her web page on his favorites. I had no idea he would do something like this and it has really upset me. I can’t help it but I don’t trust him anymore. He keeps saying he didn’t contact her, but I find that hard to believe. I want to leave him. Do you think that is that the right thing to do??<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Please slow down. Finding out that your husband looked up his ex is not enough of a reason to up and leave him. There’s too much at stake to take such drastic action without finding out more about yourself, your husband, and your marriage. Maybe he is being unfaithful to you. Or maybe he just wants to stay in touch with someone who was once important in his life but kept it from you because he knew it would upset you. Either way, some professional help for both of you is in order. Please consider going into couples counseling together to settle the old girlfriend issue once and for all. You do not want to live out your life always feeling like you are competing with her. He doesn’t want to live out his life feeling like your are always on the lookout for disloyalty. You loved each other enough to bring two children into the world. That’s reason enough to put in a few months with a counselor. I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 You’ve been diagnosed with multiple mental health disorders and are being treated with medication but have you tried counseling? Comprehensive treatment, for most mental health disorders, typically involves both medication and counseling.Medication alone is often not enough to work for your issues. For instance, you say that you can usually refrain when others are present. This indicates that, to a strong degree, you have control over your behavior. Normally, one can control their behavior but not their feelings. When one can’t control their behavior, we have a problem.A therapist can teach you how to manage the problematic high-energy moments. For instance, he or she may suggest that you wear gloves to prevent yourself from biting when you become excited.Ask your prescribing physician for a referral to a therapist. You may want to choose a behavioral therapist. Behavioral therapy is a highly-focused form of treatment that seeks to target and eliminate specific, troublesome behaviors. It might not take many sessions to remove the unwanted behaviors. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 I’m 17 and I have been with my boyfriend for about 9 months now. And he has been battling severe depression for many years. It’s constantly fighting against him, and makes it hard to have discussions about our relationships because it just consumes him and leaves me to have to abandon the problem to help him build himself up. He has thoughts of self harming and committing suicide. He has cut himself twice while we have been dating, punched windows and graveled walls, and has attempted suicide three times. I try to help him as best I can but he solely relies on me to help, and I’m not in any shape to take care of another person 24/7. I have little room to worry about myself and my needs. I love him very much but it is very difficult to have someone else’s worries on my back to carry. I want him to reach out to a therapist for help but he tells me he will do it on his own, but a therapist would be able to help him more than I can. He mentally abuses me and traps me in the relationship by threatening himself when I want to leave the relationship so I can help myself. I’m stuck between leaving for my own good, and staying to help him because I don’t want him to get hurt. Please help me.<|im_end|>

 You are absolutely right. Your boyfriend isn’t holding you close through love, he’s holding you hostage. He knows it would be hard for you to live with yourself if you broke up with him and he hurt himself. It’s unfair. It’s not at all what love is about.I think you are also right that you can’t carry him any more. It’s time to call in reinforcements. If his parents are decent people, arrange to have a talk with them. They have a right to know that he is in this much trouble. They are in a position to insist that he get help. If you don’t think his parents are a good bet, then please talk to your school counselor or nurse or to a favorite teacher.Please don’t worry about “betraying” him by calling in some help. Some secrets shouldn’t be kept. Even therapists are released from the rules of confidentiality when someone is threatening or practicing suicide. Our first job is to keep someone alive.Turn this fellow’s care over to someone who has the resources to actually be helpful. Then break off the relationship and take some time to recover. You might want to see a therapist yourself to help you learn from this experience and to help you deal with any guilt and anger you may be feeling.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hello, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 10 years ago, and I am very stable at the moment. I have helped my daughter through her struggles with depression and anxiety. I never expected my son to show any signs of mental illness, because he has always appeared to be so strong and not very emotional at all. He is 19 years old, and after several months of strange, uncharacteristic episodes, he quit his job and walked out. He disappeared and was gone for an entire week while I panicked and did everything I could to find him. I finally got a call from the cops. He was in the emergency room near Atlanta (about 50 minutes from home). He got there without a car, and never called any family member while he was out. The cops picked him up because he was running down the middle of the street in the middle of the night with no shoes on. He was cited for disorderly conduct. He then spent a week and a half in a short term facility. I brought him home two days ago. Diagnosis: psychotic disorder NOS. So now I’m not sure what to do. He has been paranoid, especially with me. He was telling people stories about me wanting to get him thrown in jail. So, my focus now is to get him back on track without too much pressure, because I believe stress had a lot to do with his psychotic break, and I want to make sure he trusts me. I’m afraid if I pressure him, he’ll run again, but how do I make sure he’s taking a shower, and brushing his teeth, taking his meds, ect without sounding like a nag? Because of the episodes in the last few months, he was kicked out of college, completely totaled his car, and is unemployed. He has nothing. How do I keep him from becoming depressed again? I’m also worried about myself. I’ve been hospitalized twice in my life and don’t want to go back because of the stressful situation. What do you suggest?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 This is obviously a stressful situation. It’s particularly challenging because your power is limited. You can’t force your son to do things that he does not want to do. Generally speaking, you can’t force people to behave in any particular way.He’s actively psychotic and seemingly not adhering to any form of treatment. He’s paranoid and the only thing that could cure or eliminate his paranoia, is treatment and or medication. Without medication, his paranoia will probably become worse.I have three main recommendations. The first is to contact local advocacy groups. The National Alliance For Mental Illness has local organizations in most communities. You can find a local advocacy group in your community by checking their website at www.NAMI.org. Many of the NAMI members are seasoned veterans of the mental health system and may provide you with good advice about how to navigate the system.The other group you may want to consult is the Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC). TAC is a nonprofit organization that focuses on helping people who have loved ones with a severe mental illness. You can find there website at www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org.My second recommendation is that you contact your own treating professionals for advice about how to handle the situation. At the very least, they can provide emotional support for you during this difficult time. It’s in your best interest to acquire as much support from friends and family as possible. The more support you have, the better insulated you will be from the stress associated with your son’s problems.My third recommendation is to contact local mental health professionals, either your son’s previous doctors and/or treatment team or a mental health crisis team. The local mental health crisis team may be especially helpful to you since they can come to your home and evaluate your son’s condition and treat him accordingly. For instance, if they believe that hospitalization is necessary, they can arrange for that to happen.It is a last resort option but call the police if necessary. If your son is a danger to himself or to others, then do not hesitate to call the authorities. Understandably, you don’t want your son arrested, however, it’s of paramount importance that everyone’s safety is protected. Please don’t hesitate to write again if you have additional questions. I will be glad to help you in any way I can. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 Thank you for writing. It may be that your mother’s words created what’s called a “self-fulfilling prophecy.” You were told from an early age that you couldn’t do anything. Kids believe the grown ups, so you accepted the judgement. The result may have been that either you didn’t try or that the normal mistakes that come with learning anything new became proof in your mind that she was right. The less you tried, the more incompetent you became. The same thing may have happened with social skills. You already believed that you couldn’t interact with others so it’s possible that you stopped trying, which resulted in not learning what you needed to know to be comfortable interacting with others.Fortunately, anything that is learned can be unlearned. You are good at studying things so now you need to start studying people. Take some time out from trying to socialize in order to give yourself some social skills lessons. Pick out some people who are comfortable socially and watch them carefully. Listen to how they manage conversations. Observe their body language. I’m not suggesting you be a stalker. I am suggesting that you are around people every day who know something you don’t about getting along with others. You can learn a great deal by paying attention.Similarly, take some time out from trying to fit in with sports and get yourself some lessons and take time to practice. You didn’t mention if your father is in the picture so I’m guessing he is not. But perhaps you have an athletic relative who would be willing to teach you about a sport. If not, consider talking with a coach at school about giving you some private lessons.Another alternative is to find a sport where you are on a team but mostly competing with yourself. Swimming and track or cross country running, for example, are sports where the object is to improve your own time. They are also sports where you can practice on your own.You are a smart young man. Social and athletic skills will not happen like magic. But they can happen with self-discipline and practice. Your mother is wrong. Her comments haven’t been at all helpful. Now that you are in your teens, you are less dependent on her and more able to judge things for yourself.Take charge of your own social and physical education. Give it a year of real effort and things will be different by this time next year.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I am a 20 year old female with schizophrenia. I am worried about my sexual fantasies, and worried that if I start stressing about them too much it might just trigger another psychotic episode, so even though this is not a pleasant subject I really need to talk about it with someone, but since I don’t feel comfortable talking about this with anyone, I figured I could write about it here. So here goes. Basically, my sexual fantasies (or dreams) are pretty much always about raping or molesting women. I don’t know why. Also, in these dreams or fantasies, it can even be children, or even babies. I find this really disturbing. (There are other things I worry about, like am I transgender, or am I a lesbian, but obviously the first two things I mentioned worry me so much more.) What I want to know is, what’s wrong with me? Do you have any idea why I have these thoughts? Also, how can I change them? How can I have healthy sexual fantasies? Is there any therapy for this? I really wish I could talk about this with someone, maybe then these fantasies would go away. I guess the only good side to this is that because of my medication, I have very low libido, so these fantasies and dreams don’t come all that often. But I’m still very worried. Also this pattern of having sexual fantasies of non consensual sex has been going on for a long, long time for me, maybe ever since I was a child. Do you have any idea why this could be? Now that I’m an adult its much more worrisome. Thank you for reading, and thank you for your help.<|im_end|>

 They could be a result of your mental illness. Schizophrenia is a thought disorder. Disorganized thinking and illogical thoughts are part of the disorder. They can also be brought on by stress.There are also cases of people who have intrusive, negative thoughts. They become fixated on these thoughts and begin to worry that these thoughts make them a “bad” person. The more fixated they become on the thoughts, the harder it becomes to get rid of them. Those symptoms are indicative of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is an anxiety disorder. Perhaps there is some anxiety-based reason for your unwanted thoughts.They could also be the result of your medication. Psychiatric medications can be quite powerful and may produce nightmares.I would recommend discussing this with a therapist. There’s nothing to be ashamed of because you have done nothing wrong. When it comes to dreams and fantasies, you can’t control them. They happen to us. Often they are simply expressions of emotion. They are not to be taken literally. Once you address your concerns in treatment, they may disappear entirely from your consciousness. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

<|im_start|>assistant
 You said that you strive for perfection “which I obviously end up with.” Perhaps you were trying to communicate your desire for perfection but did not mean to imply that you had achieved it.Striving for perfection is a worthy and admirable goal but no one is perfect. In fact, nothing in life is perfect. There is no perfect science, no perfect experiment, no perfect painting, no perfect body, and so forth. To believe that you are perfect, or that anything or anyone else is perfect, is a matter of opinion and not a matter of fact.You feel anger and hate toward your family and friends without any reason for those feelings. You should feel love and admiration for those you care about, not hate. Feelings of hate are a problem and they are abnormal.Christian Bale’s character committed heinous acts of murder. The fact that you identified with a murderous character is unusual. The movie character’s personality could be described as psychopathic. Psychopathic individuals are characteristically shallow, superficial, grandiose, are unable to feel empathy and have little to no regard for others. Those are not the traits of a psychologically healthy individual.You asked for advice about how to handle this situation before “it gets out of control.” It is good that you recognize this as a problem and want to correct it. Seeking professional help is the proper way to address this situation. Ignoring the problem would be irresponsible, especially in light of your concern that this problem has the potential to become “out of control.”You have been to “a lot of psychologists” but I would encourage you to continue to search for a therapist who can assist you. It is not uncommon to have to try many therapists to find one who can truly help. Giving up your search now would be premature, inadvisable and out of sync with your desire to strive for perfection.

 It is very difficult to watch your loved one suffer and refuse to seek help. It is additionally challenging and understandably frustrating when a loved one’s problems negatively impact the family and everyone suffers as a result. This seems to be the case in your situation.Undoubtedly you are faced with a very challenging situation. There are no easy solutions. When someone refuses to seek help, then it is the others around them who have to make the adjustments. That may mean limiting your interaction with your mother. If she won’t modify her behavior, then you may need to modify yours. You have to protect yourself. Self-preservation is not a selfish act; it is a necessity. It is important to do your best to help your mother in every way possible but it is also important that you do not let her problems destroy your life.I have three main recommendations for you. One would be to consider family therapy or individual therapy. Family therapy may be an option if she is willing to go with you to counseling. Even if she isn’t, therapy could teach the family the necessary tools that are needed when caring for a loved one with mental illness. It could also facilitate consistency. Working together as a family may also provide the leverage needed to gently urge your mother into treatment.There are other possible advantages of family therapy. If the rest of the family is open to counseling, then she may be more willing to go to treatment. If everyone else is willing to make adjustments to their behavior, then she may be open to doing the same. It also sends the message that she isn’t “the problem” and that the family unit as a whole could benefit from a positive intervention.Individual therapy could teach you how to better and more effectively interact with your mother. The therapist could help you to understand the importance of boundaries and teach you the logistics of how to achieve this important step. In addition, he or she can also help you deal with the psychological and emotional aspects often associated with caring for a mentally ill family member.The second suggestion involves contacting a local National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) support group. NAMI is an advocacy group that is dedicated to helping individuals with mental illnesses and their family members. They are particularly well-versed in the challenges of having a family member with a mental illness. Most communities across the country have a local NAMI support group. Visit their website for more information.My third suggestion involves psychoeducation about borderline personality disorder. Pay close attention to educational material designed for the family members of individuals with borderline personality disorder. There are many resources available. One popular resource is The Essential Family Guide to Borderline Personality Disorder: New Tools and Techniques to Stop Walking on Egg Shells by Randi Kreger. You may also want to try the Family Connections program.I hope these suggestions are helpful. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 You might have depression. The best way to know with certainty is to be evaluated by a mental health professional. An evaluation can determine a diagnosis and the best course of treatment.Many people with depression feel the way you do. They don’t have the energy or the happiness they once had. They don’t want to die, but they don’t want to live either. Life can feel like a chore, each day more of a struggle than the last. And just like you, the cause of their increasing unhappiness is not evident to them. Nor is the solution.That’s why consulting a therapist is of paramount importance. Therapy can correct whatever is wrong so that it is no longer disrupting your life. With the assistance of a competent therapist and a dedication to treatment, you should expect a positive outcome.Therapy is an effective treatment for most mental health problems, but many people also benefit from medication. You can discuss these options with a mental health professional, should you decide to consult one. I hope that you will. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 I am so, so sorry you are feeling so hopeless. You are only 22! You have plenty of time to find the person who is right for you.It may be a small comfort but I get letters like yours all the time — sometimes from kids as young as 12. In the U.S., we seem to be living in a culture that suggests that if you haven’t found true love (and good sex) by your teens, there is something wrong with you. As a result, young people are jumping into commitment – and sex – in order to feel “normal” even when they aren’t ready for it.Contrary to what you may have seen on TV and in the movies, what is really normal is moving gradually from group activities to a number of short-term and shallow relationships to, after many years, a committed relationship. In fact, people who marry in their late 20’s and early 30’s are more likely to have marriages that last. Why? Because these people have taken the time to mature and to figure out just what kind of person is the right fit for them. What you are doing is not only normative but is very important.You have many fine attributes. I see no reason for you to decide that you are unloveable. But there may be some things about the clinginess and impatience that you described that are off-putting. I suggest you give yourself the gift of a few counseling sessions to talk that over with a qualified counselor. There may be a few things you can change that will make others feel more comfortable around you.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for 4 years. I have found a situation similar to mine with the title of “My Girlfriend Lost Her Feelings” answered by Dr. Marie Harwell-Walker on psychcentral. However, I wanted to further the question into what actually the person who will be waiting can do.<|im_end|>

 If your ex-girlfriend has made it clear that she isn’t interested in pursuing a romantic relationship, you better listen. She’s explained that she doesn’t have these feelings for you anymore, and while it is difficult, holding onto those feelings isn’t healthy for you. Going in orbit around your ex-girlfriend is putting your life on hold — with no guarantee that you would even meet again, much less start up a relationship again.I would take the next several months to heal. Perhaps individual or group therapy can help. The work for you now is on making new connections, meeting new people, and learning new things — not on plotting some romantic chance meeting in the future with your ex girlfriend. Put the effort into self-care now. That is the best place to invest your time, energy, and resources. Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

My boyfriend and I have been on and off for just over two years. We can’t even go 1 week without fighting and will go long periods of time (up to four months) without talking. I have taken him on 1 date, and he may have taken me out once, but that is about it. 99% of our fights are text messages. He doesn’t take anything I say seriously, he verbally attacks me all the time, imp pathetic, a train wreck, a waste of his two years… so he says when he is mad. I don’t understand how he could say he loves me? He doesn’t treat me well at all and I feel abused by him. He makes me feel insecure and like I can’t do better. He belittles me, downplays all of my accomplishments. He talks about everyone behind his or her backs, he speaks poorly of my family, my family hates him, my friends hate him, I may hate him. I’m upset with him more than I’m happy with him. He makes me feel awful. He has control over me and he likes to make me unhappy. I always go back to him because I feel alone…but he makes me feel alone when we are together as well. I would say that I am at the end of my rope but what does that even mean? I have said it so many times but I keep going back. He makes me so unhappy, he is sooo cheap, and he isn’t kind or caring…. so I guess I am saying that our morals and values are completely different. He got me pregnant, I couldn’t keep it due to health reasons, and when I freaked out (and I freaked out), he told me that the way I handled myself with the news was the biggest turn off. He said it made him not attracted to me. I was pregnant with an abusive mans child and he was treating me like I didn’t handle it properly. How could he know how it should be handled? Was he pregnant? Did he have to kill his child? It broke my heart and all he had to say about it was that I didn’t handle it properly. He speaks nothing but horrible words about women; he says that we are all the same. IF HE HATES WOMEN SO MUCH, WHY DOESNT HE JUST GET A BOYFRIEND? I need help. (Sorry for my horrid grammar, I am very upset.)<|im_end|>

 The desire to make something unworkable work has left you in orbit around your boyfriend. His issues would require some very intense interventions over an extended period of time.The real question here is: What kind of support do you need to leave? There is nothing here to work on, nothing to build on, yet you remain in orbit hoping for him to change. In an indirect way, by returning to the relationship you are allowing him to continue treating you poorly.I would contact the local women’s center in your area for support, therapy, and if needed some legal advice. Don’t wait. Men with the anger management issues your boyfriend has usually continue to escalate. Don’t let his misogynistic ways continue to harm your well-being.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

My best friend said to me a couple months ago that it was normal for a guy to hit his girlfriend at one point or another. She didn’t believe me or my other friend that we had never been hit by our boyfriends, or seen our fathers hit our mothers. She admitted that her dad had been hitting her for years. She said it was just what he did when he was mad, that’s just the way it was. Her parents are divorced, and when she told her mother, her parents sent her to a psych ward. So she stopped telling people besides me about it. She came home 10 minutes after curfew (she had bronchitis and was out getting meds) and made her sleep on the front lawn. This was followed by her getting pnemonia. This morning she came in to school with a black eye. She started crying saying that she didn’t do anything this time. She didn’t understand why he’d hit her. When I told her dad that if I saw one more bruise on her I’d call social services, he hit her for telling me. When she stays over, she wakes up in the middle of the night screaming “All I did was break a dish” and “Don’t send me back”<|im_end|>

 You are absolutely right! No one deserves this. It sounds like your friend’s mother is as afraid of her dad as she is. Your friend has been living with this so long she thinks it’s normal in a relationship. Sadly, they are not alone in feeling so stuck – and stuck with – an abusive situation. In America, an estimated 1.3 million women are victims of physical assault by an intimate partner each year. As is the case with your friend, witnessing violence between one’s parents or caretakers is the strongest risk factor of transmitting violent behavior from one generation to the next.Although I appreciate your courage in telling off her dad, such efforts to intervene can backfire. Your friend and her mother need to get out of there. Fortunately, there is a women’s shelter in your city. Go to this link to learn about the services they offer. You can contact them for good advice about how best to help your friend. Another resource is The National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-799-7233. You, your friend, or her mother could call them for information and for some practical help.Please don’t get discouraged. It takes time and understanding for women to get out of an abusive relationship. Educate yourself. Try to pass information along to your friend. Talk to your guidance counselor or your parents about what can be done that won’t make things worse. Be there for her. And, by all means, keep letting her know that it’s not normal to be hurt by the people who supposedly love you. In time, she may get the message.I wish everyone well in this sad and dangerous situation. <|im_end|>"

I’ve been attending therapy for several months now and just recently (last three times) my therapist has been coming out about 20 minutes late and often ending early. She never acknowledges it, but a 50-minute session was 20 minutes. Is this an attempt to communicate something? I do struggle with talk therapy; I began going because it’s something you’re supposed to do after a suicide attempt (6 months ago due to amalgamation of MDD, fertility/hormonal issues, eating disorder, job stress, and childhood trauma). I spend a fair amount of time staring at the carpet during appointments because I don’t know what to say. I have been in therapy before, and I did the same thing, so it’s not on her. I feel like I may not have the personality for this to be successful or I’ve made her uncomfortable, but she doesn’t want to push someone seen as vulnerable over the edge, so instead she just turns up late. Is this a thing?<|im_end|>

 I’m not sure you can. You’re right. Marriage is rarely 50/50. It should be 100/100 with both of you giving 100%. In your case, it looks like you are giving 200% and your husband thinks that’s fair. This must be enormously disappointing and sad for you. After 7 years of courtship, you probably thought you knew this man well. You’ve certainly done a great deal to try to keep your love and your married life alive. But one person can’t make a marriage. It’s like putting out your hand for a handshake and the other person never responding. You end up moving your hand up and down in the air, eventually feeling hurt and kind of foolish. I would suggest couple counseling but I’m not optimistic your husband would agree to go. It’s always worth a try, though. If he doesn’t go, I suggest you find a counselor for yourself. You have some hard thinking to do about whether this marriage is worth the toll it’s taking on you. It might help to have some objective support.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I cannot provide a diagnosis over the Internet, but nothing you have written would suggest schizophrenia. In addition, I’m not aware of any research that suggests epilepsy drugs cause schizophrenia.Your epilepsy medicine could have impacted your emotions, making your feel depressed, angry, irritable, and so forth. Side effects occur with almost every medication. It might partially explain why you feel the way you do.There might be other factors as well. Untreated depression could be the problem. Some of your symptoms are consistent with depression.It’s wise to consult a therapist. He or she can objectively evaluate what might be wrong and provide the appropriate treatment. You might want to try your local community mental health center, for a sooner appointment.In the meantime, track your symptoms. This information will help your therapist determine what’s wrong. You should also try to reduce your stress. You might try yoga, meditation or exercise to relax. The more you can relax, the less likely it is you will be prone to anger or depression. Stress reduction isn’t a cure-all, but it could decrease your distressing symptoms. Good luck with therapy. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I come from a family history of multigenerational parental sexual and emotional abuse as well as NPD and severe depression/anxiety issues. Keeping a healthy relationship with my both my parents takes a lot of emotional energy and requires me to sometimes be the parental figure in the situation, especially with my mother.

 Thank you for asking such a thoughtful and interesting question. Dynamically, you and your husband share a familiar role in your respective families. It sounds like the narcissism has been a powerful and difficult feature each of you have had to deal with each of your mothers.I recommend that the two of you discuss your vulnerability and needs with each other on a regular basis — not just in crisis time. (Couple therapy may be found at the ‘Find Help’ tab at the top of this page if you feel you need help in doing this.) You want to continually join forces and share the difficulty in doing that with each other. Your families are the common enemy in this regard. It is difficult to forgive (and some research shows it is best not to do so too quickly) when the person has an abusive and narcissistic feature to them.I’d also recommend Alice Miller’s classic book: Drama Of The Gifted Child. It discusses in depth the issues of growing up with a narcissistic mother.Finally, I’d begin to pull back significantly in the frequency and intensity of contact with both families. Your future is together with your husband, not staying in orbit around the chronically self-absorbed.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year and a half and we have recently given birth to a baby boy (4 months ago). Our relationship has always had many problems and I have left him many times. I have always suspected him of cheating, (it’s almost like a gut feeling or paranoia, I’m not sure which) but he always told me that he would never do something like that to anybody, that it was so awful. He would always tell me he loves me and no one else, but I just never believe him I guess.<|im_end|>

 What I think is that you and your boyfriend are 20 years old and were not at all ready for the responsibility of having a child. You don’t love him. Your relationship has never been stable. Now your boyfriend is bailing on his job as a parent and you are constantly anxious about what he is doing. You were insecure to start with. I have no way of knowing if your insecurities are heightened by the normal exhaustion and emotionality that comes with new motherhood or if your boyfriend is in fact distancing himself from you and the obligations of fatherhood. Either way, I’m glad you are in counseling. It’s your only hope of making a family together.I hope you will take your letter and this response to your counselor. She needs to know how desperate you are feeling. Whether you and your boyfriend stay together or not, you are now parents. That binds you to each other and to your child forever. I hope you will do the work necessary to make yourselves into the parents your child deserves.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I have been having sexual relations with a stripper at a strip club for nearly a year. My therapist believes I may have developed a type of sex addiction. My therapist recently had to go out of town so I have not seen her in nearly a month, but I told her I was going to try and stop seeing the stripper. I have not gone to the strip club in over a month, but I’m still constantly thinking about the stripper, and I’m always turned on. It’s distracting and it makes it hard for me to focus on school or work. I was also seeing a psychiatrist for a mood disorder, and I was on an anti-psych medication that I stopped taking about a year ago. When I first started seeing the psychiatrist I told him I had began having powerful sexual urges that began a year before I started seeing him, but I never acted on them. I was also a huge germ-a-phobe. Why am I still thinking about the stripper and constantly turned on when I haven’t seen her in over a month and is this related to my mood disorder?<|im_end|>

 Sex is a powerful drive. Freud is often subjected to ridicule, in our modern times. Much of what he had to say about sex is not now politically popular, but it does not mean that he was factually wrong. I won’t attempt to reiterate Freudian theory in this response, but in its most simplest, sex is a very powerful drive, in fact the most powerful of drives.Some modern research concludes that human beings have sexual thoughts throughout every waking hour of every day. Your having sexual thoughts is not abnormal. Your having a sexual drive is also not abnormal. Normal human beings are motivated sexually.You had sexual relations with a stripper for nearly a year. What has replaced that sexual outlet? Without a new, equal or better, sexual outlet it would be normal to continue to fantasize about your last or more exciting sexual outlet.Do you have a sexual addiction? I cannot answer that question. Is your sex life harmful to you in any way? Again, I cannot answer the question. A good sex therapist could answer all of your questions. A good friend could not. It would be highly advisable to find your answers in the work you do with a sex therapist. Certainly, he or she could answer all of your questions and help you work through a problem, if one actually exists.I can only provide information that is general and applies to all human beings in some form and to some degree but personal problems, specific problems to an individual, must be dealt with by in-person involvement with a competent therapist. Good luck.<|im_end|>"

 I appreciate the bravery in talking about this here at PsychCentral. While everything you have done is through public information your obsession with him has a downside. It activates your thoughts about what you didn’t have in your life. I would make it a priority to talk to him about your activity when he returns as it will help him with the treatment process. Learning to cope while the therapist isn’t available is something you and he need to discuss — and plan significantly for in the future.I would also strongly recommend you and your therapist talking about adding group therapy with another therapist to your therapeutic experience. This will help you reduce your dependency on your individual therapist, while being a source of continuity when he is away.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I’m sure this is both annoying and frightening. Your husband is making you doubt your own observations and perceptions. The examples you gave are a classic example of “gaslighting”.“Gaslighting” is not a mental health diagnosis. It is a popular term that is based on the plot in a 1944 American movie. The husband causes the gas lights in their house to flicker and then tells his wife she is imagining things when she expresses concern.. Over time, he makes her feel like she is losing her mind.“Gaslighting” is now used to name when someone gains control by manipulating another person to make them question their own sanity. It is a form of emotional abuse. The person who “gaslights” is often a highly insecure person who needs to feel superior and in control of others.If this is the case with your husband, you need to evaluate whether this marriage is for you. I realize that it is difficult to consider divorce so early in a marriage but if this doesn’t change you are likely to feel increasingly devalued, anxious and depressed. You are not ill. You are being bullied. If he won’t change and you can’t find the strength to leave, please consider finding a counselor who can help you.I wish you well,<|im_end|>"

Hi I am 26 year old female I ever had any issues of any kind with any mental illnesses before July. Well In that month I was dealing with family issues and pressure be it that my family whom I do not live with anymore constantly look up to me as an support system although I have moved out with my boyfriend and my then 14 month old son. I recall one night while I was trying to sleep I had this intrusive thought,”What if God stops my heart?”. This thought scared me so much and I jumped out of bed and just stayed awake until my boyfriend finally came home from work and we watched ‘Season Of the Witch’, ironically the whole time my heart was racing. The next day I kept having that thought and I tried to shake the thought and then It was replaced by the thought of “What if I hurt my son” and then “What if I threw him into a fan”. I was in complete shock and became hysterical and saddened that I would think something like that knowing I would never do anything like that. I searched the internet and came across intrusive thoughts and then it lead to Ocd. I felt better after realizing that maybe this is what it was. I then felt depressed and felt guilty around my son for even thinking those thoughts I felt strange being alone with him and also being around anything sharp or anything that will cause danger. Eventually I begin having thoughts about self harm and I went into another frenzy. The thoughts eventually stopped and I went to the Doctor and she diagnosed me with Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood and prescribed Zoloft in which I didn’t take due to my boyfriend saying that it will not help me but have me in this dazed out state of mind. So I stayed online searching online continuously and went on yahoo answers asking,” is feeling out of it a sign of depression”?. I always felt out of it and in a daze and in my online searches my eyes fell on derealization and I became frantic. I thought “does that mean that I don’t believe anythings real?”. I was a nervous wreck. When in fact I probably was experiencing derealization which is a physical symptom that I was experiencing. But I took it out of context and stayed looking online until I came across a man on yahoo answers saying he felt as though this was all an ‘illusion of the mind’. I blew that off as crazy and then a few days later I thought to myself. “What if I started thinking like that?”. I started to panic and then started thinking about that in depth and then looked up solipsism which totally blew my mind completely away. I kept debating it everyday and thinking in my head over and over there is no way one could imagine things and not remember them. It consumed me and I thought about it 24/7 until I started becoming delusional with my thinking and searching online and reading posts and forums of people that had said things like they felt like this was the Truman Show and I of course blew that all off as crazy but the more I kept searching sites for answers and other people’s prospective on it it seems like I only dug myself deeper into the whole and I think I latched onto all those crazy things that I was reading. I was very emotional and in a very sensitized state and I feel like I have messed up my mental state and have possible become schizophrenic or maybe developed psychosis. When I think back now I wonder why the hell did I let something I read online get to me so much that I became absorbed into it? But the thoughts that I had when I was so deeply absorbed into the solipsism idea were “what if that is true”,” “what if when I’m not around nothing exists”. I know that it is illogical and irrational as far as that concept of solipsism but somehow it has shook me the core because I guess I have this secret fear of being alone. I really feel as though after experiencing that obsessive thought about my son sent me into this nervous state and from there my life has spiraled out of control. I would have problems sleeping and having intrusive thoughts about how I think I developed schizophrenia now. My mind has become so weak due to this and I have problems with remembering things and I kept looking at schizophrenia symptoms and always comparing them to myself. I feel like I am literally going crazy and drove myself there. I feel detachment as well now due to all of this stress. I know everything is real but i feel like due to me even pondering the idea made me have this detachment from everyone around me and on top of that I am depressed. I am also very vulnerable to what I read or see and will imply it to me and I feel like I have to rebuild my mental state again. Does this sound like the onset of schizophrenia? or psychosis or what? I have always been an panicky person and I feel like I am highly suggestible and if I did develop schizophrenia I feel like I brought it on myself by being a nervous wreck.<|im_end|>

 Though it is not possible to provide a diagnosis online, I can say with relative certainty that your symptoms do not seem characteristic of schizophrenia or the development of psychosis. Your symptoms may be more characteristic of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The best way to determine if your symptoms warrant a psychological diagnosis is to be evaluated by a mental health professional. I understand that you were recently evaluated by a mental health professional but given your new concerns, it would be advantageous to be re-evaluated.It might also be a good idea to temporarily stop reading nonscientific Internet materials. There is a great deal of fallacious information on the Internet. It seems as though you may have difficulty determining what is reputable information and what is not. Discuss this with your mental health professional. He or she can help you to determine what information is scientifically valid.In the meantime, try to keep yourself as grounded in reality as possible. If you struggle with this, a mental health professional can assist you. Try not to panic. The problems that you are facing can be treated. If you are willing to follow the recommendations of your treatment professionals, there is a excellent chance of recovery. The find help tab, at the top of this page, can help you to locate a mental health professional in your community. I wish you the best luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 In the American culture, it’s nearly impossible to avoid violence. Violence can be found in television shows, movies, books, and thus it is unavoidable. In your case, however, your thoughts of violence and killing are coupled with anger. You experienced a wave of anger which triggered thoughts of killing. It is not a healthy response to anger.No one has the right to harm another person, even when they are angry. Anger does not justify violence. Some people might respond to anger with violence but it in no way justifies their behavior. It is good that you have never harmed anyone. It’s important to ensure that it never happens.My recommendation is to enter counseling to learn to deal with your anger. It’s concerning that you thought of killing in response to anger. Thinking of killing and the act of killing are indeed very different but your thoughts might indicate that your anger is growing. You’ve tried breathing exercises but they did not work. You should consult a mental health professional who specializes in anger management. There are many approaches to treating anger including group therapy, psychotherapy and medication. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 You began to hear the voice of God when in great distress. I don’t think that is a coincidence. A religious interpretation might be that God came to you in a time of need. He brought you comfort. The hearing of divine voices dates back to the Bible. CNN reports that in a 1999 Gallup poll, 23% of Americans said they heard a voice or had a vision in response to a prayer. These experiences however, were very brief, involving only a few words or short sentences.A clinical interpretation might be that you are experiencing auditory hallucinations. Hallucinations are associated with psychosis. Psychosis is often triggered by stress. It is common for people with psychosis to believe that they are interacting with God or some other supreme being. It is often the first sign of mental illness.Relatedly, you could be describing an inner voice. Inner speech is often used as a coping mechanism. It could be your way of handling stress.If mental illness is present, then intervention is necessary. An evaluation could help to make that determination. With psychosis, early treatment is especially important. It can prevent the development of additional episodes or other mental health disorders. Contact a mental health professional for an evaluation. It might offer you peace of mind. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I’ve been cutting myself for a while now. Usually the cuts are small and the bleeding stops after 2 minutes. But today I cut until I saw white flesh. The bleeding was more severe, and lasted 4-5 minutes. My problem is that I don’t know when I should see a doctor for my scars? And my other problem is that my father is a doctor, and I’m so scared that he will find out if I have been to the ER. I know that the doctors don’t have the right to tell him, but I live in a small town, so I’m sure that he will find out if i have been to the ER.

 The fact that you are cutting, and the cuts are becoming more severe, is concerning. You shouldn’t be trying to hide the scars but rather attempting to receive help by reporting these incidents to both your therapist and your parents. Cutting is dangerous and indicative of being in extreme emotional pain.I’m wondering if your therapist is aware of the full extent of your cutting behavior. My sense of the situation is that you have been less than forthcoming about the nature of your cutting and it could explain why your therapy isn’t working. Your therapist can’t properly help you if you withhold important information. Your therapist needs to know the full truth.You need to be honest. Be detailed about how much you cut, how deep and how often. You should also be honest about your opinion regarding your treatment, that you don’t think it is working. Without your feedback, neither your therapist nor your prescribing physician are fully aware of your condition and can’t adjust your treatments accordingly.Another idea is to keep a journal to document your feelings. Pay close attention to the thoughts or situations that precede your urge to cut. It could shed light on the underlying problem and help to uncover what is motivating your self-injurious behavior.Finally, go to the emergency room when necessary. Do it even if it means that your parents will find out. Your safety is of the utmost importance and I can assure you that your parents would agree. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

It all comes across passive aggressively, we’ll be working and he complains that no one helps him clean, so we start cleaning and he complains that no one is doing their job.

 You are in a very difficult situation. You can’t change another person, especially if that person doesn’t think he needs to change. In addition, there is a power differential here that makes it almost impossible to talk to the boss without risking your job. As you pointed out, the time you tried to give your boss feedback, he reasserted his superior position. You weren’t acting like a child. He was acting like an authoritarian “parent”. He keeps his workers off balance by screaming and by being so inconsistent. You never know what to expect. If he keeps this up, he is likely to lose customers as well as staff.Frankly, I think you should start looking for another job. Your boss is unlikely to change. The workplace is toxic. In the meantime, I hope you can hold onto the perspective that your boss’ behavior has very little to do with you. Let his comments roll off your back. They are loud but they are meaningless. I also very much hope you have a good support system outside of work to regularly remind you that you are okay and he’s not.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 It sounds to me like you already have a reasonable solution. You don’t have to marry in order to be friends and lovers. You have more to lose than to gain by giving in to his demands to somehow prove to him that you are there for him. What concerns me most is that he asserts he is the only one who truly loves you. These are the words of a potential abuser. Love isn’t about isolating someone. It’s not about making someone feel they can’t be loved by others. Real love is generous and kind. I hope you don’t believe that he’s the only one who cares. Your sons certainly love you and are protective of you when you aren’t protective of yourself. It’s one thing to “accept” him as he is. It’s another to cave in to unreasonable and selfish demands. I hope you will trust your intuition.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I grew up with a younger sibling with autism, and I deeply love and care for her. As I grew up, my parents always told me that I had to be successful so I could care for her when they died. I was perfectly okay with this at first, but as I entered grade 7 I started thinking life and my reasons for living.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I don’t think you have a psychological problem per se nor are you a “pathetic human being.” Your parents placed a heavy burden on you. Even as a young child, you were told that you were going to be the lifelong caretaker of your sister. What your parents did to you was unfair. You never had the opportunity to be who you wanted to be. Your parents saw you as an extension of themselves. They chose your sister over you. They should have had two children, who for each they wanted the best possible life. Instead they have joined you together to form “children.” They want the best for their children, not what’s best for each child.As a response to this heavy burden, you developed a coping strategy. It’s evidence of your resiliency and resourcefulness. This strategy protected you from experiencing a great deal of psychological pain but it was temporary. Your true feelings eventually reemerged.You are in essence sacrificing your life for that of your sister’s. While that sacrifice might be noble, it is unhealthy and it will lead to a great deal of dissatisfaction in your life.Your sister requires the assistance of health and mental health professionals who can properly care for her. There are many social service agencies and independent caregivers that can assist your family. Your sister is best served by trained mental health professionals who have years of experience dealing with autism. Call your local social service agency and inquire about what services are available for your family.Your reaction to this situation is logical given when you have faced. Of course you love your sister and want what’s best for her but this should not come at the expense of your life. You have the right to be happy and to live an independent life. You can help your sister as much as you chose to when you have developed your own life. You must seek meaning and happiness in your life.This burden has led to your contemplating suicide. Nothing, no plan, that leads you to suicidal thoughts can be the correct plan. Erroneously, the plan that your parents had assigned to you was the plan that led to suicidal thoughts. I’m sure that wasn’t their intention. They have a problem because they have a daughter who has special needs and they don’t know how to care for her after they are gone. They would benefit from counseling, to help them assess their choices.You could also benefit from counseling. It can help you to understand the burden that has been placed upon you and assist you in becoming more independent of your family. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My husband has APD. I have 2 questions please. Could u give me a good contact for the specific psychotherapist which do specialize in sociopathy in Las Vegas? Nobody is able to help me and regular psychiatrist is not able to understand sociopathy issues here.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 As for your first question, I do not know anyone personally who deals with sociopathy in Las Vegas. I would encourage you to use Psychcentral’s therapist locator feature that can be found by clicking here.It is difficult to know if therapy could help your husband’s sociopathy problem. Many scholars have debated this issue (can sociopathy be treated?) for decades. Until recently, the answer was in short “no,” many did not think it was possible to rehabilitate a person who was labeled as a “sociopath.” More recently however there are many different views on the subject and some researchers and clinicians say “yes,” it is possible for individuals who display sociopathic traits to be helped with therapy. The true answer is that whether or not an individual with anti-social personality disorder (ASPD) can be helped depends on many factors.For instance, it can depend on how willing an individual is to engage in therapy or if he or she sees his behavior as a problem. Part of ASPD is the tendency to blame others for their problems, something you said that your husband does with you. If someone does not believe that he or she has a problem then it is unlikely that they will seek help for that “problem.” And why would they, they have no problem, from their perspective. You did not write in your letter if your husband wanted help and was willing to go to treatment or if he felt that his behavior toward you was problematic. If he does not think that he needs help and feels there is no reason to attend treatment then he probably would not go.Whether or not your husband can be helped, assuming he’d agree to attend therapy, might also depend on the skill of the therapist. Individuals with ASPD are known to lie and might try to trick the therapist. In therapy, a person with ASPD might be argumentative, get easily angry or upset or may be noncompliant or resistant to change. Working with individuals who have ASPD can be challenging and not all therapists are trained to work with this population.If you are not able to convince your husband to seek treatment then you should strongly consider therapy for yourself and a domestic violence shelter. You seem all too willing to stay with your husband despite his very aggressive and physically abusive nature. I know that you moved from another country and may not have many supportive friends or family nearby (if any) but this does not mean you have to surrender your life to your abusive husband. He does not “own” you nor does he have the right to harm you. If he does go to jail this might give you a prime opportunity to seek help for yourself from either a mental health professional or a domestic violence shelter. Even if he does not go to jail, you should still try to find a way to seek help for yourself. I am worried about your safety and so should you be. You’re isolated, have few or no supports and you are living with someone who physically harms you.You can also try calling the domestic violence national hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or visit their website here. This organization may be able to help you.Please consider writing back to let me know how you are doing.<|im_end|>"

Last month I feel like I was doing ok. I was a little depressed (lots of things going on) but, I got a job and I was sooo excited. My first day I satrted feeling dizzy and lightheaded. I went to the dr. and I had a sinus infection. The next couple days I started having panic attacks and lots of anxiety. Then I woke up the next day and was so anxious I couldnt think straight. I didnt feel like “me” anymore like I was walking around in a fog. this kept up for 3 weeks.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Given that I have only a small part of your “story” it’s difficult to know precisely what has occurred. It does not make much sense that you were doing seemingly okay and then you weren’t. If I were your current therapist, I would explore your history of anxiety and depression and also try to pinpoint what event has or set of events have led you to start having panic attacks and anxiety.People generally have panic attacks and anxiety when they feel that their life is out of control. And generally, when the anxiety and panic begins, some aspect of their life is out of control. Sometimes people cannot make the connection between what is happening in their life and their panic attacks and anxiety. In other words, sometimes the panic attacks and anxiety symptoms seem to the individual experiencing them to come “out of nowhere.”My suggestion for you is this: you need to be evaluated by both medical and mental health professionals. See a medical doctor to rule out any medical issues that may be causing your symptoms. You mentioned that you have had a sinus infection. It is plausible that the sinus infection is having some effect on how you have been feeling. For instance, you said you are walking around in a fog. When people have sinus problems and/or allergies, they often describe that they are unable to “think straight” or that their thinking is “cloudy.”But having a sinus infection may not have anything to do with what’s wrong or it might only explain a small part of the problem. This is why I suggest that you see a mental health professional also, and not for medication only. As you have said, medication can work to take the edge off of your anxiety but you need something more.It would be helpful for you to find a therapist who can work with you to explore your depression, panic attacks and anxiety. He or she could teach you strategies to decrease your symptoms. At this point in time, you experience panic attacks and anxiety but have no way to control or stop these occurences. It does not seem that you have any way to combat these symptoms. Medication is simply not enough to correct this issue. A therapist can help with this.According to Help Guide’s website, “When it comes to treating anxiety disorders, research shows that therapy is usually the most effective option. That’s because anxiety therapy—unlike anxiety medication—treats more than just the symptoms of the problem. Therapy can help you uncover the underlying causes of your worries and fears; learn how to relax; look at situations in new, less frightening ways; and develop better coping and problem-solving skills. Therapy gives you the tools to overcome anxiety and teaches you how to use them.”I wish you luck.<|im_end|>"

From a teen in the U.S.: I was molested as a child by my grandfather and I never told anybody about it until recently. I suffered from severe depression since I was 5-6 because of this. I told my mom last year and she was helpful and said that she would take me to a psychologist and said that she was here to help. My mom started crying when i told her and said that it was all her fault and i told her that it wasn’t but then she started making it about herself and saying that she could of been molested too even though she does not recall ever being molested.<|im_end|>

 I’m so very sorry you have been feeling so alone for so long. It’s true that not everyone gets the mother that they want or deserve. It sounds like your mother has issues of her own that are preventing her from being able to support you. It may also be that she can’t stand feeling responsible for not protecting you and so doesn’t want to deal with what happened to you.The good news is that you do have two parents. I encourage you to confide in your dad. You are a kid. It is not your job to protect your mother from possible humiliation. In this case, if anyone should be humiliated, it is her father, not her. Regardless, adult humiliation takes a back seat to child suffering. Reach out to your dad or some other adult relative you trust to get the help you need.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

About a month and 1/2 ago my wife started thinking someone was hacking into her Facebook account and reading her notifications. I put all the security measures in place and ensured her she was safe. It has gradually gotten worse to the point she believes people are watching us through our cell phones and webcams. She thinks people are following her around town and have even been in our house and her car. She thinks all of our computers and phones are hacked and most of the things she believes are going on just aren’t possible. A couple months ago she would have thought the things she is telling me are happening are crazy. Now she truly believes it’s all real. I’m very worried about her. This is consuming her and destroying our marriage. I don’t know how to ask her to go see someone because she doesn’t think anything is wrong. I just don’t know what to do. She’s 33 years old and we have two kids. She’s an awesome mother and talking to her she still seems like the same person I’ve always known besides her belief in this one crazy idea. All of this is new to me so I’d appreciate any advice.<|im_end|>

 Your wife seems to be paranoid and delusional. At this point in time, it may be too early to know if she has schizophrenia. Paranoia and delusions are associated with several psychotic disorders, schizophrenia being one of them.Symptoms of psychosis can also be the result of drug use and in rare instances, organic brain disease.Generally speaking, psychosis does not go away on its own. It typically requires treatment. It tends to get worse over time, with an individual’s behavior becoming increasingly worrisome and potentially dangerous. The sooner that she can receive treatment, the better. When it comes to psychosis, time is of the essence.Psychosis is a break with reality. People with psychosis are no longer able to think rationally. Their perception of the world is skewed. Your wife doesn’t think anything is wrong with her and that is typical among people with psychosis. They have difficulty judging their perceptions accurately.I would recommend that you make an appointment for her to see a mental health professional and go with her. She’s probably not going to understand why she needs to be evaluated by a mental health professional, and she may even come to see you as her enemy. It’s best to psychologically prepare yourself for that possibility. Try not to take it personally. It’s likely going to be a confusing and scary time for her but if you are supportive and understanding, this will help.When you both meet with a mental health professional, report all of your concerns. You could do this in the presence of your wife, but it may be better to do it outside of her presence; it all depends on the situation. The mental health professional should provide you with guidance about how to proceed. Generally speaking, psychosis is most effectively treated with medication. Medication can decrease the symptoms of psychosis and in some cases, eliminate them entirely.If your wife is unwilling to see a mental health professional, then contact a mental health professional who can assist you in handling this situation. Contact your local National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) support group. They are an advocacy group who helps people in circumstances like yours. I hope this helps. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From Australia: I am married for 9 years and have a daughter going school. I love my wife and child and in-laws as well. But I think I am possessive. My brother-in-law is 5 years younger than me. I am OK with him. But I always notice a problem with my wife. She behaves a bit different when her parents are with her. I don’t see the intimacy between us when her parents are around. I remember the days where I was overseas with my wife and felt very happy. When we go out for sight seeing with in-laws I am not interested in following them and they are not interested in following me. But my wife looks like stuck in between where she spends half time with them and half time with me. I kind of not happy with this. I feel my wife should give me more importance than her parents or her brother. We have our own house and in-laws have their own house. I would like to know how I should react in such scenarios where I am possessive and feel my wife is sliding on her parents and I am left alone. Should I take a bigger decision of moving away from in-laws far away? I don’t want to do this because I do think they are essential for me and my family but at the same time I want my wife to give more importance to me than them. Please advise.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You’re correct. You are being overly possessive — and you are putting your wife in an awkward position. Of course she isn’t as intimate with you, when the two of you are with her parents. That kind of intimacy is a special bond that belongs with the couple. When she is with her parents, she needs to give them her time and attention as well. She loves you. She loves her parents. Because you won’t join in with the family, she feels she has to divide her time between you. I imagine this is more stressful for her than you realize.You are hardly left alone. You have a home and a little girl. You also have the supportive extended family most people would wish for. This is not your wife’s or your in-laws’ problem. It is yours. Work on being grateful that you have a wonderful family and a wife who maintains the connections among all its members. Focus on getting to know your in-laws as people instead of seeing them as a threat. (They’re not.) And don’t think about moving further away. My guess is that will make things much worse for your wife and consequently for you as well. If you can’t get over the idea that you are competing for your wife’s attention, please consider seeing a therapist.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hi, Please help. In October 2013, my Granny had passed away due to a long term battle with Cancer. Shortly after this (January 2014) my Girlfriend of 6 years had developed Psychosis and spent the next few months going in and out of hospital. I have stayed with her for the past year and a half dealing with it. throughout the past year, I have had two friends that were getting rather violent and angry towards me and stopped talking to me as a result in April. I had a friend commit Suicide in May. I have other friends whom I talk to and see every now and then, However I feel as if they are avoiding me.<|im_end|>

 You are dealing with a number of recent losses which understandably have made you upset. On top of that, you have noted possible symptoms of depression.I don’t have enough information to know if you made the right decision regarding your girlfriend. You said that staying with her would’ve led to severe depression but did not say why. If you are correct, then it would seem that breaking up was the right decision.She is also experiencing her own psychological difficulties. Neither of you sound healthy enough to maintain a flourishing relationship, at this time. After you both are more stable, maybe then consider reestablishing the relationship.You should consider counseling. Depression and relationship problems are two of the most common reasons people enter counseling. Counseling can provide you with guidance about your relationship and teach you how to manage your possible depression symptoms.Another option is a grief/bereavement support group. Many people benefit from talking about their losses. Sharing your loss often facilitates the healing process.Once you are feeling more stable, you will be in a better position to make decisions about your future and with whom you want to spend it. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I have a friend who I’ve known since childhood, I’ll call him Bill. We’ve never been very close, but we’ve had the same circle of friends almost all our lives. In fact my fiance is good friends with Bill now. Personally I’ve have problems with Bill being very insensitive. He says and does things things without thinking about other people’s feelings, it’s like he’s chronically incapable of considering other people. But I always try to let it roll off my back because Bill’s friends with my fiance. Then something happened – a dear friend of ours, a man I dated briefly in high school, committed suicide. Instead of calling me or my fiance to tell us about it, Bill posted about it on Facebook. It’s been a month now since it happened and despite moving forward with my grief, I feel like I can’t face Bill, I can’t give him my condolences, I just don’t want to see him any more. What he did was so obviously inappropriate and most of the people who saw the post didn’t even know our friend, or care, they just said “Oh man sorry dude.” My fiance forgives and forgets, and that’s fine for him. But I think the whole thing was just too hurtful. Is it wrong to want Bill out of my life for good?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m very sorry for your loss and I’m very, very sorry for how you found out about it. Posting on FB was inappropriate and cruel for the man’s family and real friends. From your description, I suspect Bill is clueless, not intentionally mean. But that doesn’t excuse his behavior.It isn’t wrong to want him out of your life but it may be impractical. You travel in the same circles and your fiance considers him a good friend. Don’t put your fiance in the position of having to choose between you. He has a right to draw his own conclusions. But you have a right to tell Bill how hurtful his posting was and to take some distance. Ideally, you and your fiance should find way to limit your contact with Bill without putting too much stress on your relationship.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

(im sure im not pregnant lol) i dont really feel full and i eat a lot. is this just because of high level of stress? not any kind of disease right? and also i cant fall asleep easily even though im tired and sleepy(im always tired) i cry but i dont really feel very very sad. i mean im a bit sad but not to a level that i have to cry i guess. im trying describe my situation as detail as possible so that you can define it accurately. :)<|im_end|>

A. The fact that you are not sleeping is likely contributing to this problem. Sleep problems are directly connected to mental health problems. People who don’t sleep well have more mental health problems than people who do sleep well. More generally, people don’t function well when they are sleep deprived.Sleep deprivation can cause significant negative physical and psychological effects. Physically, sleep deprived people are less alert and have memory problems. Researchers have identified sleepiness as a major contributor to traffic accidents.Emotionally, irritability is more prominent. Moods can be erratic and shifting. Sleep deprived people are less happy and struggle to contain their emotions.It would be an understatement to say that sleep is fundamental to good physical and mental health functioning. It could be that you are “annoyed” by people because your sleep deprived mind is overwhelmed.You asked about going to the hospital. You should seek emergency assistance if you are at risk of hurting yourself or someone else. Otherwise, try counseling. You should also consult your doctor to determine if a sleep disorder is present.Hopefully, you will utilize the assistance of treatment professionals who can assist you in finding a solution to this problem. Good luck and please take care.<|im_end|>"

 As you have already discovered, starving yourself and feeling guilty aren’t making things better. But you’ve taken the first couple of steps on the journey toward mental health. The first step to healing is to recognize there is a problem. The second step is the willingness to get needed help.Fortunately, there is a well-researched, effective treatment for BPD. It’s called Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). Created by therapist Marsha Linehan, it has helped thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, of people with BPD as well as the people who support them.DBT is a structured approach that helps people learn cognitive and emotional regulation, things you’ve already discovered you desperately need. By learning how to manage your emotions and destructive thoughts, you will have less stress in your life and your relationships will improve.There are well-trained DBT therapists all over the world. Ask your doctor for a referral or go online to find one.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I am sorry that you are experiencing such a difficult time. What you may be describing are some of the social challenges of schizophrenia. In fact, a hallmark characteristic of schizophrenia is impaired social functioning.Navigating the social world is an inherently difficult task and even more so for people with schizophrenia. Studies consistently show that individuals with schizophrenia underperform in areas of social skills and social problem-solving.Gerry Hogarty and his colleagues have developed a treatment for the social cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia and related disorders called cognitive enhancement therapy (CET). The treatment is multidimensional and involves computer-based training for attention, memory and problem solving.Group therapy is also an essential element of CET. The group therapy sessions focus on teaching cognitive flexibility, how to take the perspective of another person, how to develop better emotional perception, among other things. The essential goal is improved social functioning. Thus far, the results of CET have been quite promising.You mentioned being part of an early psychosis program. You should inquire about whether or not they offer CET or some version of social skills training. If not, perhaps they could refer you to the appropriate services. I think you would benefit from social skills training and or coaching. I hope this helps. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My husband and I have been married for almost three years. We dated for over six years before we married. I felt like I knew him so well and we would be fine. I knew he had a temper (at times)but overall he is an amazing person. He really is very loving and kind overall. Sometimes though (more frequently recently) he gets SO angry. He curses at me and calls me names. I feel like he really hates me at those moments. He doesn’t hit me he just yells a lot and I can tell he is FURIOUS! He gets angry when things don’t go his way. His behavior is fine if all is well but if things go downhill just a little (the car breaks down, I’m late for something, or any other inconvenience) he gets angry really easily. I feel like he is a spoiled brat sometimes because he gets so mad when he doesn’t get his way.<|im_end|>

It sounds like you married the Hulk of Marvel comic fame. When frustrated, mild mannered Bruce Banner becomes a giant, turns green, and goes on a rampage, leaving wreckage in his wake. Unable to contain his rage, he becomes inbcreasingly isolated and eventually unable to maintain close relationships. (Even comic books can teach us something.)Your husband has little tolerance for the least bit of frustration and takes it out on you. Of course it’s not okay for him to curse you. Of course you have a right to be upset. If the two of you decide to have children, this is likely to get even worse since caring for children rarely goes smoothly.The PairedLife website lists potential reasons why your husband may gets angry with you for minor things. Reasons could include anything from underlying mental and physical issues that are not being addressed, to environmental factors.“Low testosterone. While many people associate high levels of testosterone with heightened levels of anger, that behavior is associated with the abuse of steroids, not natural testosterone production. Studies have shown that men with low levels of testosterone are more irritable and prone to mood swings. Environmental factors such as diet and sleep quality can have an impact on testosterone levels. Many men suffer from low testosterone, and it commonly goes undiagnosed.Low serotonin. One of the key neurotransmitters in our brain, serotonin, plays a role in emotional and mental health. If we have too little of it, we become irritable and unhappy. Much like testosterone, eating and sleeping habits can play a big role in determining serotonin levels.High stress. Cortisol, the stress hormone, can lead to irritability as well as sleep and cognition problems. If your husband is experiencing severe stress at work and is not sleeping and eating properly, the high levels of cortisol can turn him into a very different person.Loss of male identity and purpose. The constant grind of your husband attempting to live up to some impossible masculine ideal can wear him down. A single-minded focus on job success and earning large amounts of money can leave him feeling stressed, isolated, and lonely. He may feel that in comparison to others he is inadequate, and these feelings can manifest themselves in angry outbursts.Unaddressed emotional trauma. It is also possible that your husband is dealing with some unresolved emotional issues. By trying to suppress these emotional wounds, he becomes angry and irritable.”Whatever his other wonderful qualities, his behavior is not acceptable in anyone over the age of two. My biggest worry is that someday your husband will lose it and will hit you or break something important or get into a road rage contest or an argument and seriously hurt somebody. Before something truly terrible happens, he needs to either take an anger management course or see a therapist to learn how to manage his anxiety when things don’t go exactly as he expects. I hope he is mature enough and values your marriage enough to take charge of himself and get the help he needs. I hope you respect yourself enough to insist on it.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

When I was around 7 I used to break down crying because I felt guilty about doing something “bad”. At around 13 or 14 when I started developing sexual urges. I was semi religious/god fearing (although my family was not). I used to punch my arms, legs and head till I was bruised after masturbation. I was trying to train myself to stop. At around 15 I started developing symptoms of depression which worsened and became suicidal thoughts at around 16. At age 17 I planed a date and a method for my suicide but did not act or attempt it.<|im_end|>

 Social anxiety might stem from your feeling self-conscious. Self-consciousness is the result of a lack of confidence or low self-esteem. If you felt more confident, then you might feel less self-conscious and less anxiety. Lack of confidence might be the result of incorrect judgments about yourself and your abilities. People with depression tend to minimize the extent of their abilities.Self-esteem and confidence are gained through achievement. The more you achieve in life, the more confident you will feel.Social anxiety might also stem from your misjudgment about other people’s expectations of you. For instance, you might believe that you’re “supposed” to behave a particular way in a social situation. If, in your mind, you don’t measure up, you might feel self-conscious. It’s important to perceive reality as it is, not how you wish it would be or how you think it should be. Only what is real or true matters.Avoid negative expectations, try to be yourself and don’t think that you have to be someone you’re not. For instance, the idea of public speaking often causes high anxiety. An individual might feel anxious because they believe they have to measure up to some expectation they have in their mind about public speaking. But in reality, those expectations are self-created and have no basis in reality.Finally, you might try increasing your number of acts of kindness. A recent study found that people who engaged in more acts of kindness had a greater reduction in social anxiety than people who engaged in fewer acts of kindness. The individuals who engaged in more acts of kindness were also less likely to avoid social situations. The researchers theorized that acts of kindness helped buffer negative social expectations.Acts of kindness also led participants to anticipate positive reactions in social situations which in turn made them less likely to want to avoid social situations. In other words, they expected a positive reaction from social situations which increased their desire for social interaction.If this issue continues to be a concern, you might find it advantageous to seek professional help. Mental health professionals are trained to deal with these problems and can give you advice that would expedite the problem solving process. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

There are many people who don’t have their driver’s licenses and they are not losers. You’re not a loser either. In fact, research has indicated that fewer younger people are getting their licenses in general. A 2016 study by the University of Michigan found that the percentage of 16-year-olds nationwide with a license decreased from 46% in 1983 to 24% in 2014. Roughly half as many 16-year-olds are now getting a license compared to before. You’re not alone.Maybe you can’t get your license now but that doesn’t mean you won’t in the future. There may come a time when you can acquire your license. Don’t rule it out as a possibility.For now, you’ll have to accept the fact that you don’t have a license. It’s not what you want and it’s not ideal but it is the reality of the situation. Understandably, it’s upsetting but it’s a waste of time and energy to worry about things you cannot change.Even if you’re not religious, you might appreciate the wisdom of the serenity prayer widely used by Alcoholics Anonymous: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.” It’s a useful mindset for dealing with the reality of the things you cannot change.I wish I had a more satisfactory answer for you but I know that the best course of action is to learn to accept reality. The sooner you can come to terms with the truth, the less you may suffer emotionally. Thank you for your question. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I suppose the issue I am having now, directly relates to issues from my childhood; so I’ll start there. My parents separated when I was pretty young, so I grew up in a single parent household. Which, surprisingly, is not the problem. My mother has OCD (along with other emotional problems). We were never allowed to be sad, or mad, or anything else that wasn’t happy. She would literally get angry with us. “What’s wrong with you?” she would say in a disgusted tone. She yelled a lot.<|im_end|>

 The way I see it, you and your husband are cooperating in this argument. Instead of dealing productively with whatever the issue was, the two of you got completely distracted and derailed by an argument about what’s fair to bring up in an argument. It makes me wonder what was so difficult about the original issue that you went off on such a painful tangent.Yes, you have baggage. Who doesn’t? My guess is that you could find something to pin your husband’s defensiveness on. Yes. It’s a betrayal of sorts whenever someone we trust uses something they know about us to hurt us – or to defend themselves. But arguing about that will only continue the argument about an argument. You can react without overreacting. If there’s a next time, simply calmly say something like “I’m sure we could go down that road but we’ve got a problem to solve. Is there something about it that is too upsetting?” Stick with the topic at hand and you’ll find out more about each other.Meanwhile, I’m sorry that your mother wasn’t able to tolerate any emotional variation in her kids. That must have been very, very hard. As a kid, you couldn’t do much to change it but you can now. I think it’s long past time to refer her to another therapist. You can’t forge a close mother-daughter relationship as long as you take the role of a combination counselor and parent. No wonder you’re exhausted! If your mother won’t go initially, make an appointment for yourself and do some groundwork. Then you and the therapist can invite her to join you. Gradually, your therapist can help you shift over the responsibility for your mom so that you two can start to have some fun together. Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to tell her: “Save that for <|im_end|>"

I’m worried I may have some kind of repressed memories, which I know isn’t unusual, but there is something off and I am unable to pinpoint why I am having these issues. I’m a twenty-one-year-old female. I distinctly remember having sexual dreams/images in my head very young. By this, I mean around the age of four or five. Typically, they’d be other characters from movies or shows that I had been watching in nonconsensual situations (the antagonist of the show would be committing the act to the protagonist. I have always associated with the victim.) I don’t know how I knew how sex worked at such a young age. Especially not something non-consensual. I don’t ever remember seeing it or having it explained to me, but I knew anatomy and where what parts went.<|im_end|>

 You may never know if you were sexually abused. It’s possible but unless the abuser admits it, you’ll may never have confirmation. Memories are not always reliable. Studies have shown this to be true. A good book about problematic elements of memory, is The Memory Illusion by Julie Shaw. She discusses the neuroscience of memories and why they are sometimes problematic.Abuse or no abuse, the treatment is the same. The best place to receive assistance with intimacy and sexuality is in sex therapy. Ask for a referral for a sex therapist from your PCP. You might also try searching for a sex therapist by clicking the “find help” at the top of this page. Call four to five prospects and discuss your issues over the phone. Ask how they would help you. Choose the one with whom you feel the most comfortable and meet them in person. That will likely be the best match for you.Some people find the idea of sex therapy awkward or embarrassing. There’s nothing to be ashamed of when it comes to intimacy problems. Ultimately, sex is not an act of intimacy. It is an act of sexuality; as in “birds do it, bees do it, even educated fleas do it.” Sex therapists are experts and can help remedy this issue. Good luck with your efforts.<|im_end|>"

So, this all started when my boyfriend mentioned to me that our roommate and the girl he’s seeing gossip about him.He says that the girl asks our roommate all sorts of questions regarding him the entire night and have been doing so for over a week, therefore making it impossible for him to sleep. I was never able to hear anything at night even when he says they’re talking at that very moment and he was even 100% sure the neighbors heard it too, saying the neighbors would also talk about the girl gossiping so late at night. A few days ago, he had enough and confronted our roommate, telling him she needs to leave and not to bring her anymore. Our roommate completely denies it and even the neighbors told us, they never hear anything through the walls. Ever since then, my boyfriend has gotten worse saying that he feels like he can read the neighbors thoughts and will be so focused on the voices that only he hears, that he’ll completely ignore any conversation I’m having with him. He smoked pot every day for almost the last 10 years but since his paranoia and behavior, I’ve asked him to stop. It’s only been 2 days since he’s stopped completely and still hears these voices constantly. He’s planned to stop for a month minimum but I don’t know what else I should do. He refused to see a therapist and only confides in me about these things he hears so I don’t want to break his trust. Could it be the pot or something else entirely? Was telling him to stop smoking the right thing to do and what can we do in the meantime to help him make the voices go away…<|im_end|>

 It’s difficult to know what is causing the voices. Marijuana use has been linked to psychosis. Research has indicated that our brains are not fully developed until around the age of 25. Drug use before the age of 25 could significantly alter the brain chemistry and potentially lead to mental health problems.The decision to stop using marijuana seems appropriate. The longer that he can abstain from using drugs, the more likely it is that the voices will decrease. However, the damage might have already been done. Only time will tell.He has refused professional help but that is what he needs the most. The voices might be indicative of the beginning stages of a psychotic episode. If so, then therapeutic intervention could prevent the development of a full-scale psychotic episode.The best way you can help him is to continue to encourage him to seek professional assistance. He is unwilling to see a therapist but perhaps he would be willing to see a primary care physician. Offer to attend the appointment with him. He might change his mind.You stated that you do not want to break his trust but it might be necessary. If revealing his symptoms would convince him to seek treatment, then do it. Prompt treatment is imminently important. It could prevent the development of a lifelong, severe mental illness.You can’t force him to seek treatment but you should do everything within your power to convince him to seek professional help, even if it means breaking his trust.

We live next door to a formally-diagnosed paranoid Schizophrenic who refuses to take his medication. He is in his early 40’s and lives with his mother. He has been unwilling/unable to get a job and spends his time manicuring the yard (7 days a week). Year by year, we’ve watched his paranoia slowly overtake him with “episodes” (involving the police) increasing in frequency. With each passing year, he has withdrawn into his parent’s house more and more, also making his mother a virtual prisoner in the process. On the rare occasion when his mom can speak to anyone (usually brief chats when she gets the mail) the comments don’t deviate from “he’s getting worse”. He has a variety of guns and, per his mom, now thinks that everyone “wants to do him harm.” While I’m primarily concerned with my family’s safety, the neighbors on the other side their house also have small children. It is only a matter of time before he finally snaps. What can we really do other than move away? We really aren’t in a position to do that and it doesn’t really address the problem – certainly for anyone else in the neighborhood.<|im_end|>

 It is difficult for a layperson to judge the danger of another individual or situation. Your neighbor may be dangerous or he may not be. It is important to correctly determine the level of danger so that you may protect yourself and your family.The world is a dangerous place and there is no way to eliminate the danger. People are shot randomly while getting gas, walking down the street, in their homes, and even in their places of worship. No one would’ve thought that attending a public meeting with their Congresswoman in a shopping center or going to the movies to watch a Batman film were dangerous activities, but they were. Situations that appear not to be dangerous sometimes are. That is the world we live in.Research shows that individuals with schizophrenia generally do not pose a danger to others except in rare cases and when certain conditions are present, despite the general public believing otherwise. Individuals with schizophrenia are much more likely to do harm to themselves or to be victims of violence than they are to be perpetrators of violence.Your psychotic next-door neighbor may be no more dangerous than another neighbor who is not psychotic but who takes a particular combination of drugs and then engages in horrific violence. Likewise, your psychotic next-door neighbor may be no more dangerous than an individual who recently lost his job, is angry, suicidal, and wants to seek revenge on his employer and coworkers.If you believe that your neighbor is a danger to your family, then precautions must be taken to keep your children away from him. If that is not enough and this problem continues to concern you, then even if it means a great financial loss, you must move to a safer neighborhood. Those are ultimately your only options. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

When I was 4 years old I was diagnosed with ODD and a high functioning autism also known as Aspergers. And later, I was 5-6 I was diagnosed with ADHD. Growing up I didn’t have very many friends, and the ones I did have emotionally abused me in the relationship from 3rd grade all the way up to 6th grade. My father was very emotionally neglectful and never gave me his approval. When I was 9 years old I had my first dream of killing someone, but I don’t remember the dream as a negative, I remember being more fascinated. Theses dream accrued now and again through the passing years. I have been also diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety. I only really have one or two friends at a time because I have a very hard time trusting new people and are very suspicious of them at the beginning of a relationship. And somebody can only screw me over If I let them, by either trusting them or letting down my guard. Pity the fool who decides to earn my trust and screw me, they will know what it feels like to hurt. If I don’t destroy them in that instant, I will keep my enemy close until I have everything I need to bring him all the way down to nothing. And ever since I was young I have been able to make anybody feel any emotion I want them to feel. I can go from happy to cry just by choice if I choose to do so. I feel disconnected with my emotions and they are more something I use to fit in. Around 6th grade, I learned that retaining appearance was very important to my future with relationships. So I started paying attention to other people’s emotions and listening to others to understand and see what pain, regret, shame, confidence, etc look like. Since that point, I have had no problem obtaining a relationship if I want one.<|im_end|>

 I don’t know you and have not interviewed you and thus can’t determine your diagnosis over the internet. It’s always best to be evaluated by an experienced therapist, in person.Generally speaking, it would appear that there are two problem areas: relationships and emotions. You are suspicious of people and feel a greater than average need to protect yourself against them, going so far as to plot to harm the people who you perceive as having crossed you. It’s not normal to be so suspicious of others and to be plotting your revenge. Your distrust will make it difficult to develop close relationships.People with ASD often struggle with both relationships and emotions but more information is necessary to determine if your symptoms are indicative of this disorder or not. In either case, these issues will likely hinder your ability to develop close, meaningful relationships. You stated that you have ‘no problem obtaining a relationship’ but how good are those relationships? Your approach to people may have been the result of events that occurred in your childhood or due to your diagnosed depression or anxiety. The origin of these problems should be explored more thoroughly in counseling.It’s normal and healthy to want to connect with others. When problems prevent you from making these connections, you should try to correct whatever might be wrong. You’ve had contact with therapists in the past and it would benefit you to consult them again. They would be in the best position to answer your question and to assist you in developing more appropriate relationship skills. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 You’re probably right that your paralysis has something to do with your history. As a child, you were helpless to get out of the situation. You learned then that the way to prevent further hurt was to essentially freeze. It was a survival technique that worked at least some of the time. You never learned how to be effectively assertive because it was pointless to even try with your parents.Lessons learned in childhood are very powerful. In our early years, we put down a template for how people operate and what we need to do to get along. We then carry that template into every other relationship. I suspect that you generally avoid being around such difficult people. That works as long as you can get away. But, as you are finding, when you are stuck in the situation, your old survival pattern comes back. The problem is that it doesn’t work in your adult life.This is exactly the kind of pattern that therapy can resolve. Therapy will help you separate past from present and learn new ways to take care of yourself. Your therapist will help you practice handling these situations during sessions and will give you support while you try them out in your life. You will probably also need to do some work healing the hurt child you carry within so that angry people don’t immediately send you running (figuratively) for cover.You’ve carried the hurt long enough. Please follow through. Ask your doctor or someone you trust for the names of therapists in your area who have a good reputation. I always suggest that people give themselves permission to interview a few therapists before settling on who to work with. The most important variable for whether therapy will be effective is how comfortable you feel with the therapist.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: When I was about 4-5 yrs old, a boy about 7 would take me into the closet and under the bed and take my pants down and touch me and put objects in my undies and say I had to leave it there for awhile. My memory of the rest is pretty hazy. But we were both just kids so it must be my fault just as much as his? Was I abused?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Your letter is not at all inappropriate. It is very concerning. But assigning blame is not going to be helpful. From my point of view, neither of you were “at fault.” Yes, you were “abused” in that an older person (in this case age 7) was being sexual with you without your “consent.” But a 7-year-old generally doesn’t know anything about stimulating another person sexually. And a 4-year-old will generally follow the lead of an older kid.Both of you were confused and upset. It is highly likely the boy was doing what children do when they are trying to process trauma. He may have been acting out something that was happening to him that he didn’t understand but knew wasn’t right. You probably couldn’t make sense of the situation either but knew that hiding something made it bad. My heart goes out to both of those two confused little kids.You mention other experiences that affected you including continual emotional abuse. I’m concerned that the result is a damaged self-esteem that is at the root of your emotional and social problems today. I’m very glad you decided to write. You know you are in emotional distress. But you aren’t getting the help you need. Perhaps the same low self-esteem makes you think you don’t deserve it. You do.You have a long life ahead of you. At 19, you are now old enough to find the help you need without asking permission and without involving the people who emotionally abused you. Make an appointment with a mental health counselor who can give you the ongoing support and guidance you need to claim the sense of self-worth that is waiting to be freed.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

It’s difficult to know what may be causing this fear. If I had the opportunity to interview you, I would be attempting to determine its origin. Generally speaking, fears are valid if there is real danger. In other words, is there a rational basis for your fears? For instance, is there evidence to suggest that your home is unsafe? Do you live in a troubled neighborhood? Have neighbors experienced break-ins and thus you fear your home will be next? Have home invasions been a problem in your neighborhood? If the answers to any of those questions are yes, then your fears may be valid. If not, then your fears may not be valid, possibly indicating the origin is your anxiety disorder.No matter the origin of your fears, it would be prudent to contact a therapist. They could assist you in determining what the problem may be, if your fears are valid, and most importantly, how to treat the ongoing issue. Living in fear is stressful and unpleasant. It doesn’t have to be that way when good treatments are available.Ask your parents to assist you in finding a therapist or ask the school guidance counselor. They can help you to find good treatment. When it comes to anxiety disorders, it’s best to be proactive regarding treatment. Anxiety disorders tend to worsen without treatment and thus, getting help sooner is better than later. Good luck and please take care.<|im_end|>"

 Laziness is not the problem. Nor is the “need to grow up.” This problem likely stems from your childhood experiences and interactions with your parents. You were raised to believe that you had to be perfect. This fear was instilled in you. The fear has stayed with you and it is degrading your life. It is clearly holding you back. It is keeping you from realizing your full potential.Keep in mind is that you are no longer a child. You don’t have to impress your parents. You don’t have to answer to them or be “perfect.” No one is perfect. The standards that you felt compelled to meet were unrealistic. No one could have met those standards.Understanding “why” you engage in certain behaviors is an interesting analytical exercise but it does little to assist you in correcting them. I would recommend psychotherapy. A psychotherapist could teach you more efficient behaviors. By your own admission, when it comes to almost every activity, you procrastinate. You may simply need to be taught a different way of doing things. Learning a new skill set could greatly assist you in breaking the cycle of procrastination.Psychotherapy can also help you learn new ways of thinking. Both you and your therapist could analyze your thought patterns to determine psychologically what is holding you back. Fear and anxiety are the symptoms but what thoughts underlie those feelings? What keeps the fear and anxiety alive? The goal of this process is to determine how logical or illogical your thought patterns are and to correct them accordingly.Analyzing and systematically correcting your behavior and thought patterns are the essence of cognitive behavioral therapy.If you are not interested in psychotherapy, then you may want to read self-help books. M. Scott Peck’s book The Road Less Traveled discusses issues such as anxiety, procrastination and the fear of living. You may want to check Psych Central’s book reviews for other recommendations. Others find cognitive behavioral and other related therapeutic workbooks very beneficial.In terms of finding support groups, I would encourage you to do a Google search for procrastination or anxiety support groups. Psych Central hosts anxiety forums that you may like. Check with the community mental health center or local psychotherapists to determine if anxiety support groups are available. I hope this helps.

This is crazy because i have been with my Fiance for four years and engaged for two. In the beginning of the relationship with Fiance I had just broke off a previous relationship with someone else and the ex didn’t want to let me go so he would constantly call my phone and was bothering me. My fiance was getting really upset so I changed my phone number, moved in with him and started our life together.<|im_end|>

 What I think you should do is get out of this relationship immediately. Your fiance is insecure and controlling. I’m guessing that he was badly burned in his prior relationships and now thinks that all women are cheaters. Yes, that makes his anxiety somewhat understandable. But it doesn’t give him the right to be constantly grilling you, monitoring your phone calls, and threatening you. That table going over should have been the very last straw!You have done nothing wrong. You don’t deserve to be treated this way. No one does. You shouldn’t have to constantly prove your innocence to a man who says he loves you. You are a working woman which means you will have work relationships that need your attention. I hope you also have friends and family to talk to and spend time with. That’s only normal.Marrying him will mean a lifetime of dealing with accusations and fear. You deserve better. If you have children, they shouldn’t have this kind of destructive relationship as a role model for adult behavior and marriage.If you can’t extricate yourself, please look for some help.

I grew up in a upper middle class family. I was given most things I wanted and all the essential things a child would need. I have a brother who is 25, he has borderline personality disorder. He acted out as a child/teenager, was constantly arguing with my parents and soaked up much of my parents attention.

I admire the clarity and depth of understanding you bring to the situation. But your family is not likely to be the source of your healing. They seem to still have significant issues, and there is difficulty between your fiancée and your father. Tolerating them from time to time isn’t the same as healing from your childhood experience. You need a different plan.I would highly recommend group therapy run by a skilled individual. At its core group therapy is a correction of the pathology begun in the family of origin. Healing the issues you are carrying with you from childhood should be the prime objective. Once this has happened you will be in a much better place to decide how to handle your family.As a child, you needed something they were unable to give. Don’t make the same mistake again. Heal yourself through the group process first,then see where you are at with your parents.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year. He is my old boyfriend from years ago. We have been talking about marriage and our future plans, but haven’t formally announced it mainly because of his mother’s resentment towards me. She does not like me at all. Which has also made the rest of the family distant from me. He can’t even mention me in a conversation because it becomes a fight. I keep my distance and don’t come around since that’s how she prefers it. So, for family dinners, birthdays, etc. he attends alone without me. Recently though I felt upset that he decided to spend Christmas Eve and Christmas Day with his family. He stated family is very important and his bonding with them will eventually lead to his mom being more accepting of me. He knew I felt upset so decided he would cancel with them to be with me. I asked him not to since initially his plans were he wanted to spend the holidays with them. I stated all I wanted is for him to be fair with me as he is with them. I feel he does not draw a line or create boundaries with them. I know he feels like he has to choose between me and them sometimes. But I don’t know what to say anymore or how to handle it. I have no grudges against her. I understand she has been through a lot and is a very troubled person, but I’m worried things won’t change and it will become serious conflict once we get married. Am I being too selfish? How do I support him without getting hurt?<|im_end|>

 Thank you for this question about your boyfriend’s family. This is your boyfriend’s responsibility to manage. He needs to be an advocate for his relationship with you with his family. If he is not doing that, which it doesn’t seem he is, then the work for you as a couple is to find out why he isn’t taking a more direct approach and making some clear requests and boundaries with them. You have stated your age as early thirties and I am imagining him to be roughly in the same age category. A thirty year old man about to be engaged needs to be better able to deal with his family.Ask him how you can help him do this. It might be in the way of letting him visit with his family alone to have these discussions, it might be in the way of going to couple’s counseling together. In any case the responsibility lies with him to deal with his family and advocate for his relationship with you. If he is unable or unwilling to do this, you may want to have a serious discussion with him about how this will affect your relationship going forward.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I started a job 6 months ago and work with a girl who seems to be a bit off. She always stares very intensely at other people and never says anything. She stands very uncomfortably close to other coworkers, behind them, next to them, etc., and never says anything, just stares and listens. She eavesdrops on other people’s conversations and reads over their shoulders on computer screens. She’s very socially awkward and we all think she has some type of disability or diagnosis that we don’t know about.<|im_end|>

I’m sure this is very uncomfortable. It wouldn’t be ethical for me to diagnose your coworker since I haven’t interviewed her. What I can do is remind you that you and your colleagues have a right to a comfortable workplace. Although I certainly appreciate your compassion about your intrusive co-worker, you are not obligated to work under these conditions. It is not a service to her either for her to not get constructive feedback and support so that she can be an effective and cooperative colleague.Please talk to your supervisor or to the Human Resources office about your concerns. Tell them just what you told me — that you empathize with your coworkers challenges but that she needs to be helped to understand how her behavior is interfering with other people’s work.

From the U.S.: I am 25 years old and am feeling lost. I have a creative brain and am drawn to the arts but I have a hard time being “creative” I feel like everything has been done already and everyone that I know is on a path to success.There is nothing about me that stands out as an artist, and I feel like I just don’t offer anyone anything.

 I think it’s safe for me to say that your ADD isn’t your problem. In fact, most of the creative people I know say they have ADD. Those who are successful have found ways to make it work for them. They have developed ways to work around it when they have to meet deadlines but, generally, they enjoy the creativity, spontaneity and multi-faceted thinking that comes with it.I think your problem is your reluctance to pick something and run with it. You won’t know what will ignite your passions until you get involved. Clearly there is something about film and the arts that hooks your interest enough that you went to school for it. Trust that for now. Don’t worry about excelling. Just get some experience.If you don’t know how to manage the ADD, see a mental health counselor for some help with it. There are practical ways around it so it can be a plus in your life instead of a problem.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My best guy friend and I starting seeing each other now we both are just friends. He expressed to me that in his last relationship he only had physical feelings for his x and looking back now he didn’t love her and didn’t miss her when she wasn’t around. He stated it’s kinda how he felt/feels towards me except there’s more feelings for me. He had a bad relationship with his x and was border line suicidal. So my question can a person not gave emotional feelings for example not miss someone when spending numerous days a week with, have a physical relationship yet not have any feelings of love towards? And is there anything I could do to help him? He’s never experienced love and is 23 it’s something everyone needs to experience.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 To answer your question simply: Yes, it’s possible for someone to have regular contact with another person and even to have a physical relationship without love. It’s a poor substitute for the real thing and some people do settle for that. The fact that your friend says there have been more feelings for you suggests that he is capable of developing closer emotional bonds.Contrary to popular beliefs, it’s not at all unusual for someone not to have yet fallen for someone at 23. He has lots of time. But he will only find someone if he opens himself up to looking. Very few people find true love by sitting around waiting for it to happen. To find love, he has to look for it. That means meeting other available people and being willing to go out with a number of women until he finds the right one. That means opening himself up to being hurt. It also means being willing and able to let other people down gently when he knows that a relationship isn’t going to go anywhere. It means not settling for what is easy but not satisfying.You can only help him by pointing that out and perhaps being a sympathetic ear and support as he goes through the process. But he’s the one who has to do the looking if he wants to find a life partner.I wish you both well. <|im_end|>"

I have had problems with depression for roughly 5 years. For a few months I have been bulimic and I am trying to hard to fix myself. My mother is a full time nurse and has a life of her own so i don’t see her very often. Once I thought very seriously about suicide (not a current issue) and she told me it was simply because I was a teenager. Similar response to when I confided in her and told her I was suffering from depression and bulimia. My older brother overheard though and had a very serious talk with me, saying he was very worried and urged me to not rely on my mother and seek help on my own. He has since moved away. My father lives a long way away and when he found out I was feeling depressed he told me I had no reason to as I had so much. Which made me feel very guilty and isn’t the first time I have had that thought about my depression. When my friend told her mother she was feeling depressed she got help, and both her mother and mine were very worried about her and told her she always had their support. I am glad that she is receiving care but I still felt very upset about the care and attention she was receiving from my mother when I was not. I have tried to fix myself many times, sometimes with short lived results. I am beginning to feel the effects of bulimia: stomach pains, sore throat etc. The effects are not serious or life threatening but if I can I want to live without them. I want to be healthy and happy but I don’t know how or if I deserve it.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 First and foremost, you deserve to be healthy and happy. Please, never forget that.You stated that the effects of bulimia are “not serious or life-threatening” at this time. I would disagree. The fact that you are experiencing physical symptoms is a sign that the bulimia is serious and ultimately may be life-threatening. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of all mental illnesses. They are very serious and require prompt treatment.Sometimes parents may deny that their child is experiencing mental health problems because they’re unclear about how to handle the situation. Perhaps that is why your mother is reacting the way that she is. If that is the case, you need to make it clear to her that your symptoms are real. This can be done in several ways.The most efficient way is to be honest and straightforward. Request that your mother take you to a mental health professional and inform her that you would like the same type of care that your friend received. If she is unwilling to assist you in receiving professional help, then write her a letter detailing all of your symptoms, or speak to a school faculty member or a trusted relative.I’m sorry that you are experiencing these problems. I hope you are able to get the help that you desire. A good first step is knowing that help is necessary. Your current challenge is making that clear to your mother. Be persistent and never doubt that you deserve help. It won’t be easy but your health and happiness is worth the effort. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From India: I have known my best friend for the last 14 years and she is 50 and i am 36. She has two grown up daughters. She is a person who worries a lot and takes all things seriously even when her husband teases her. As her husband lived abroad she lived in her moms house, She did have a lot of troubles with her husband and even now he is the general Manager of an estate she continues to live in her moms place as she does not want to go and live with him.<|im_end|>

You are correct. Making her better is beyond you. You have nothing to apologize for. It was also healthy for her daughter to remove herself from the situation.From your letter, it seems to me that your friend may suffer from recurring major depression. When in an episode, she sees the world through gloomy glasses. Nothing anyone says is going to have positive impact.Your friend needs to accept that she probably does need to take medication for the rest of her life and she does need to have on-going mental health support from professionals. As long as she is competent, you can’t make her do either. As an adult, she has the right to make her own decisions, even bad decisions.Sadly, this kind of situation sometimes results in further deterioration. At that point, she may be willing to ask for help or her husband may have to consider signing her into hospital to save her life. If you can, I do suggest you share your letter and this response with her husband. As her spouse, he has more legal rights and perhaps more personal leverage than you do.I wish you well, <|im_end|>"

I don’t know what to do. I have diagnosed anxiety and depression, as well as diagnosed anorexia. I have done outpatient treatment for the past 1.5 years. This is my first year at university but my parents are 25 min away. I really don’t want to do recovery anymore, I am just so tired of it. But my parents are paying for college and staying in recovery is the only way I can continue my education. I am not really progressing with recovery, just kind of floating by. Probably relapsing a bit. I just really don’t want to challenge myself anymore with recovery. whenever I do challenge myself end up hating myself and feeling miserable (to the point of cutting myself). What should I do? If my parents knew how much I am struggling they will put me in Inpatient and that means no more college and I will lose my scholarship. But I cannot continue like I am. All I do is isolate myself. I have absolutely zero friends. I am just so shy and anxious around people and my self-esteem is super low. What should I do? (From Missouri)<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
I am sorry you are having such a difficult time with the transition into the university. Since you are new there I would highly recommend talking with the university counseling center as many of the things you are struggling with are conditions they are well trained to handle. This way you can get some additional input into your situation.I’d discuss with the university counselors your thoughts about recovery and ask them if they have any suggestions for helping you deal with wanting to stay on scholarship as you find ways to cope that are different than what you are doing. Universities are typically used to dealing with helping students make the transition. At the very least it allows you to get another opinion with people who have experience.Finally, I’d recommend you pick up a copy of the book U Thrive as it was specifically designed for students coming into college and what you can do to help feel better while you are there.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: My daughter, who is 14, informed me that over the course of about a year, my 16 year old son has touched her while she’s sleeping. According to my daughter, this has happened about 4 times. I asked as many questions as I could think of; the information I gathered is that it was mostly her breasts, my daughter didn’t stop him, she continued to pretend to be asleep, he doesn’t know she knows; she has begged me to not say anything to him or anyone else. I am at a loss. I don’t know what to do. I now have her sleeping in my room to make sure she’s safe. She said she feels safe, but I’m unbelievably concerned. I want to help my daughter through this, but clearly my son needs help as well. I don’t know how to approach this; get them both the help they need.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Of course you are concerned! Of course you are at a loss. No parent is prepared for something like this. I’m so glad you wrote.First: Some secrets shouldn’t be kept. You are right that both kids are troubled. Your daughter may feel safer now that she is sleeping in your room, but that doesn’t make the impact of the situation go away. My guess is that she is upset with herself for not telling you right away and upset with her brother for violating her trust.Your daughter needs to be told that pretending to sleep when she was being assaulted is a normal response. She didn’t know what to do. Why would she? So she just froze. It’s what kids in such a situation often do. That is not something to feel guilty about.She shouldn’t feel guilty about telling you either. The most caring thing she could do for the entire family was to tell. Please — tell her that you are going to talk with her brother and get to the bottom of what this is about. Denial of the situation won’t guarantee that it will stop nor will it get him the help he needs.Then talk to your son. Don’t put it off. Approach it with as much compassion as you can muster despite your justifiable anger. He already knows that what he did was unacceptable. Unless he is mentally ill, he feels guilty about it. He knows he needs help. One thing to ask him is if someone has sexually hurt him. Often kids who abuse other kids are acting out something that happened to them.Ever since you moved her to your room, everyone in the family must know that something is up. It won’t surprise either of the kids that you looked for advice here or that you will insist that everyone get into some therapy.Find a therapist who specializes in adolescents and sexual abuse. The therapist will do an evaluation and will give you guidance about what to do next. Please don’t try to go it alone. You need support as well as practical help so that you can help both of your kids — and deal constructively with your own shock and distress about the situation.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From Dubai: Hey, I hope you are doing well. I am 18 years old, I am the eldest in the family and I have a big problem. You see, my brother is 16 years old and is in high school. I live with my mother, brother and sister. My younger brother seems to have a big issue, ever since he was a kid, he was always angry and would fight with little kids, and then gradually grew up to be a loner. He dislikes hanging out with boys his age, dislikes going out with us, or participating in any activity. He just likes to spend his time on his laptop playing Minecraft (and other games) and watching youtube videos, he never studies, barely actually… just before the exams, and ignores his chores, we can’t talk to him because he is just angry… And in our religion, praying is quite important, it relaxes the mind and he never prays, just wastes his time… We can barely afford his high school fees (30k dirhams which is around $8,167.71 US Dollar) and don’t even know how will we afford his college fees, he probably won’t receive a scholarship.<|im_end|>

 Your brother is lucky to have such a supportive family. You’re right. He has a big problem and the things you and your family are doing are not helping him. Since this has been going on since he was a child, he is suffering from some undiagnosed problem. He needs a mental health evaluation.I suggest that the money your family is paying for school would be better spent getting him some professional help. He isn’t doing what he needs to do to succeed in school. More important is to help him have a chance to succeed in life. School can come later.I wish you well.| <|im_end|>"

 There are probably two main reasons why you run from these things: fear and feeling as though you don’t deserve to be happy.Fear can be crippling. It can prevent you from having a good life. It’s possible, though I can’t be certain, that you may have lacked healthy psychological role models. It’s also possible that you were raised in an environment in which you did not feel safe or supported in your attempts to be independent. Without feeling safe in the world or having healthy psychological role models, everyday aspects of life can feel overwhelming.The fact that you feel as though you don’t deserve friends, jobs, education, love and relationships indicates a belief that you are unworthy of these things. It’s also a sign of depression.My recommendation is to consult a cognitive behavioral therapist. Both your fears and your negative self-opinion are irrational. They are based on faulty thinking that is out of line with reality. Once you have corrected your thinking, and it becomes more in line with reality, you will feel better about yourself and your life.It’s also especially important that you are in treatment because of your suicidal ideation. It’s imperative that you seek help as soon as possible.Please be aware of the fact that all of your symptoms are correctable with therapy and medication. If you are willing to participate in therapy, there’s every reason to believe that you can overcome your fears and irrational thoughts and live a high-quality life. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m so sorry you are in this painful situation. Sadly, many adults don’t understand that when they make life decisions, it can have enormous impact on their kids. My guess is that your dad’s decision doesn’t really have to do much with you as a person — although of course you take it personally since it’s affecting your life. Your dad has been unhappy and he is grabbing at a new start to solve all his problems. It won’t work, of course. He can’t erase his past. His life with his new girlfriend and her kids is likely to be as complicated and challenging as his life has been before. For one thing, like you, her kids may not be welcoming the change in their lives.Unless and until your dad figures out that the “grass isn’t really greener” elsewhere, there is little you can do to change his mind. Hopefully, at some point he will come to his senses and regret this decision. But even if he doesn’t, his rejection doesn’t mean that you’re unloveable or that you aren’t worth someone’s attention. You are. Make friends with your grandparents.You and they are in the same boat — out of control of your dad’s behavior. Reject your dad’s rejection and find other adults who appreciate you and who are willing to help you on your way. Set some goals for yourself. It’s impressive you have brought up your grades. Keep it up. That’s going to help you make the life you want someday.I understand that the situation hurts and is terribly unfair. But you don’t have to let it ruin your life.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I have concerns as to whether I am just a depressive person or whether I have BPD- I appreciate a diagnosis cannot be made via the site but advice on which direction to continue would be appreciated.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) may be a realistic possibility. You do match some of the symptoms. Another complication is the possibility that you were sexually abused. Further supporting this possibility are specific “triggers” that propel you into a panic attack.The out-of-body experiences you have described are also characteristic of an abusive history. They are a form of dissociation. Dissociation is usually associated with a history of trauma.I am not familiar with the UK healthcare system but if receiving a formal diagnosis is necessary to continue therapy, then you should pursue that option. In addition, it would be advantageous to undergo an evaluation to determine if BPD is an accurate diagnosis.Cognitive behavioral therapy seems to have helped but 20 sessions does not seem to be enough. You continue to experience very problematic symptoms. If you do have BPD, CBT is typically not the first line of treatment. Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) is. DBT is an evidence-based and proven treatment for BPD.In the meantime, you should learn all you can about BPD and its treatment. I would suggest reading books written about BPD by both mental health professionals and individual sufferers. All perspectives would be helpful. One book that many have found particularly helpful is I Hate You Don’t Leave Me. BPD workbooks exist that help individuals to deal with specific symptoms. You may also want to consider joining an online BPD support group/forum. We have one here on Psych Central. Face-to-face support groups may also be beneficial.Do everything you can to get the help that you need. I wish you the best of luck.<|im_end|>"

I don’t know what is the problem with her she keeps on speaking and fighting with the family. if we say anything to her she doesn’t listen and talks very rudely to her children. I tried a lot to change her but she doesn’t change at all. She blames my dad and his family for this problem. She fights a lot with my dad and her children to. I am really frustrated with her because she just keeps on blabbering stuff and doesn’t do anything. We thought she needs a psychiatrist so we wanted to take her there but she says that she is fine and my dad needs a psychiatrist. She thinks very highly of herself. She doesn’t really care about her children too. I have a brother who is a special child but she keeps on being negative about him that he will die eventually.

 I believe your instincts are right and it sounds as if your mother needs professional help. My experience has been that someone who will not be willing to see a psychiatrist may be willing to see a regular physician. This is where I would begin. By getting her to have a complete physical you can ask to accompany her to the doctor. In talking with the physician the topic of her agitated moods will give the physician an opportunity to ask questions. Ruling out a medical cause for her behavior should be the first approach. Then the physician can make suggestions for follow-ups. I’ve found that suggestions from physicians work better than suggestions from family members.<|im_end|>"

From India: I am married for over two decades. My wife’s elder sister is also married and is around a year older than I am. She stays in another city and visits her parents every year, or two, as my in-laws also stay in the same city as ours. Though not until many years after my marriage but, over the years, I have become very fond of her. I find her very beautiful, very charming and full of virtues, so much so that I cannot keep my eyes off her when we meet. I am obsessed with her emotionally and miss her presence for weeks and months after she returns to her city. Her departure always leaves a big void in my life and I keep thinking about her long after she is gone. My wife is the only emotional support I have and she is very caring and full of virtues, too. I love her a lot. However, I often strongly feel like opening my heart out to my S-i-L but am afraid that all hell would then break loose because my S-i-L is a woman of great character and cannot even think of reciprocating such feelings towards me. Nevertheless, I feel sometimes that if I confide in her then, maybe, she might keep this as a secret between the two of us as its divulgence shall ruin her sister’s marriage. I realize that my conduct is unbecoming of a husband and also immoral but I feel completely gripped by her thoughts. What is your advice?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 However charming and beautiful she is, your sister-in-law is not available. To tell her your feelings would damage your relationship with her and your relationship with your wife. It could even damage the relationship between the sisters and your relationship with the entire family. Even if your S-I-L kept your secret, this would be so. She could not look at you without knowing that you are betraying her sister.But you know this. In spite of knowing it, you persist. Instead of looking deeply at yourself and why you won’t totally commit to your marriage, you distract yourself with the excitement of the forbidden. Ultimately, this will destroy the relationship with the wife you say you love.I think you are asking the wrong question. You say you love these two women but you are not committed to either. One of my best teachers used to say that two relationships are fewer than one. Spreading your feelings over two people means that neither person gets all of you. For some people, this is a way to avoid taking the total emotional risk that is involved in really joining with another.My advice? Get into counseling and deal with whatever it is that frightens you about really marrying your wife — all the way. Only then should you make a decision about what to say to the two women.I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

18 months ago we gave birth to a two-pound baby girl, 14 weeks early. While the baby is doing very well, the trauma is having profound effects on me and my relationship. While we had issues before, I believe it has lead to the climax of our problems. I feel I didn’t get the needed support from him. I’ve tried to talk to my Husband, now that the baby is better but he insists we need to move ahead and forget it. I, however, can not move pass the feeling of disloyalty and abandonment.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m so, so sorry that you have had such a hard time. I don’t believe that having a spcial needs child is the cause of the break-down in your relationship. The cause is the fact that you and your husband were faced with a major crisis. When the individuals in a relationship and the relationship itself are strong, the couple pulls together and copes. When there is weakness, a crisis puts the problems in stark relief. As it happens, it was the baby’s needs that made those problems obvious. But it could have been anything else that required your husband to to step up and be a husband and partner.I do suspect that he is experiencing enormous grief over the child. Rather than facing his sadness and anger that he has a baby whose needs are continuous and challenging, he is retreating to his pre-adult life; repeating the relationship he had with his mother with his daughter and acting as if his friends and mother are more central to his life than you are. Although this is in some ways understandable, it isn’t at all comfortable or helpful to you or to your relationship with each other. For now, your daughter will adore him just because he is daddy but at some point she will make more complicated demands on him too. At that point he may take more distance from her as well.I’m very sorry he won’t consider counseling. For your relationship to survive, something needs to happen. I suggest you start counseling even if he won’t go — not because I think you are the problem but because you need and deserve some support. Your counselor can hear the whole story and may have some suggestions for getting your husband to join you in treatment. I also hope you will consider joining a parent support group for parents of kids with special needs. People often find it comforting to talk wiith other parents who are going through the same kinds of things and to exchange ideas and experiences that help your children.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

It seems as if my Mom is always siding with my older brother, if he puts his feet up behind my head while I’m sitting on the couch, my mom tells me to move. She does this with all my siblings too, though. I have three younger siblings as well and no matter what they do she will defend them in every way, if one calls me a bad name, she will say they are going through something. Anyways, my brother is a year and a half older than me, he has had a few health problems in the past and my mother has really flocked to his side since then. (it’s obviously not his fault, I usually get along with him and I do love him.) He has recently started University which was really hard for my mom to deal with, he started the process last year and every step of the way she wanted to know how it was going with him and supported him whenever he was doubting himself. I have a lot of the same problems and struggles he went through, when I start to talk about University and how I’m stressed and worried about applying to my mom she just says “You’ll do fine.” Or “Don’t worry so much.” She doesn’t seem to really want to know how i’m doing or how i’m feeling. Whenever she gets mad about something, as well, I’m always the one she will scream at. I’ve gotten tired of it. If it’s not a big deal I’ll just take it, but sometimes I come home from school and I won’t be able to relax until I go to bed because she’ll start looking for fights and expects the most out of me. She treats me like a child and holds my siblings in favor (I feel), but expects me to act like an adult. If it’s a real problem I’ll stand up for myself and that’s when she’ll scream at me, my dad often gets involved because he knows I am not trying to pick fights with her, but I won’t take her disrespect if I have not done anything to deserve it. My siblings are never really yelled at. Anyways, sorry this is so long. I started to blurt out everything rather than stick with one issue.<|im_end|>

 From Canada. It is okay that you let all of this out here. I can appreciate how difficult it is not to be acknowledged in the face of your siblings getting preferential treatment.

In either case you wanting something from her that isn’t forthcoming will continually annoy and drain you.I’d put my emphasis on getting ready to leave next year for the university. Start looking to carve out a life of your own and find people who will notice and love your for who you are. While it is sad and unfortunate that your mom is this way — trying to change who she is won’t help as much as you investing in yourself.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Please answer, it is effecting my school work.<|im_end|>

  There are times when people are exhausted and can’t fall asleep. This can happen for a various reasons, including anxiety. When people worry, it can keep them from sleeping.I’m also not sure what exactly you mean by “having no desire to go to sleep.” Is this because you have a lot of energy and you wish to stay up? Are you engrossed in a television program and this is why you don’t want to go to sleep? What is it that you’re doing instead of sleeping?When people are exhausted but don’t want to go to sleep, it may be because they want to do something. I would need more information about you to properly answer your question.I’m also curious as to whether you take medication and if this could be impacting your sleep. Other variables that could impact your sleep include how much activity you engage in throughout the day, how much caffeine you drink and at what times, how much time you spend on screens, among other things. These could be impacting your desire to sleep.Your depression and suicidal thoughts are also concerning. It’s imperative that you discuss this problem with your parents and ask for their assistance in seeking professional help. There is no shame in seeking professional help. Most mental health problems are highly treatable but you must be willing to ask for help in order to receive it. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 Your friend is very lucky to have a friend like you. You are very right to be concerned. I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of your letter but I can tell you that what you wrote suggests that losing his job and losing his sense that he was needed has put him over the edge. It’s possible that he is struggling with a depression with psychotic features. He needs more than your friendship. He needs to be evaluated by a professional mental health worker (psychologist) ASAP. Enlist his wife as a partner. She deserves to know what is going on. Make some calls and find a therapist or crisis team that will be willing to see him. Then do your best to get him there.It probably won’t work to try to talk him out of his anger. It’s almost impossible to reason someone out of thinking that is so unreasonable. But maybe you can appeal to his sense of responsibility. You and his wife can remind him it won’t do his children any good to have their father in prison and to be the children of a murderer. Tell him that there are other ways for him to gain closure from what was a devastating experience for him. Murdering someone will only backfire on his family. Offer to drive him to the appointment and even to go with him if it will help him follow through.If you aren’t successful, you and his wife should talk to the crisis team in your area and ask for advice about whether there are legal steps you can and should take to make sure both his ex and he stay safe.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 What an unhappy way to live. I’m sorry for everyone in the family. It seems that your parents never learned how to be a harmonious couple that makes compromises for everyone’s benefit. Instead they seem to think that the way to settle a disagreement is to “win” — either by making more noise or by getting violent. Quarreling is the only language they understand. It’s happened so much, they’ve come to see it as normal.You can’t change them. The only person you can change is yourself. Eventually, others might follow your example. But whether or not they do, you can learn to be a more reasonable person when there are disagreements to settle.When someone starts to quarrel with you, simply say, “I don’t like to fight. When you want to calmly discuss this issue with me, let me know.” Then leave for the next room or for a walk. If the person follows you and is still rude, repeat what you said. Then simply look at them respectfully and don’t respond. When they stop yelling, say something like, “Thank you. Now let’s see if we can come to an agreement.” If the person starts to fight again, just stop talking.This won’t be easy. Quarreling is the language of your family. But if you want to have a chance of making a different kind of family for yourself, you do need to practice getting out of fights and talking quietly and reasonably with others.As for picking your marriage partner: I may not understand the situation as I’m in America. But it seems to me that people like your parents are likely to pick someone who speaks their quarrelsome language because that’s what they find most comfortable. If you want a different kind of partner, you may need to do some looking on your own and then not care so much what your parents think. But only you understand whether the consequences of doing so are worth it to you.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Thank you for writing. There’s a difference between thoughts that are “racing” and “racing thoughts”. Racing thoughts tend to be repetitive and feel over-whelming. Often they are a sign of acute anxiety or possibly bipolar disorder.Unless you have other symptoms, I think you are someone who runs through all the things he needs to do and think about when you wake up. I have a guess that the reason you feel bad is because you worry that these waking thoughts are abnormal. That isn’t necessarily so.Another possibility is something called “morning anxiety”. Morning anxiety refers to waking up with feelings of stress and worry. It’s usually a reaction to stress. A person with morning anxiety is also likely to have generalized anxiety. If that is the case, it would be helpful for you to see a mental health specialist who can provide you with some coaching and support for managing your stress.Mindfulness techniques are also often helpful. Focus on a word or phrase or feeling and breathe deeply. Another technique is to write things down. By writing, you get the thoughts out of your head and onto paper. Still another technique is to do a mental sort of the thoughts: Discard those that make no sense. Put your attention on the thoughts that do need it. The internet has many articles that provide tips for settling down your thinking. See if following some of those suggestions are helpful.I wish you well,<|im_end|>"

 First: No question is stupid. Life is full of possibilities. Asking questions is how we get answers.So — the answer to your question is this: Yes, it is absolutely normal for there to be ups and downs in a marriage. As one wise person once said, “Marriage is an institution that keeps us together until we fall in love again.” Yes, I know you aren’t married but you have created a family. I hope marriage is the next step.You have gone through many significant changes in the past few years. New love is different from married love. A baby does take most of our energy and love. Even the best relationships get less attention when there is an infant in the house. You have been off medication — which you may or may not need to restart. (Do talk to your doctor.) And you think you may have some level of OCD (another topic for your doctor). Whew! It’s a lot to handle.My suggestion? Stop over-thinking all of this. Enjoy your baby. Love your partner as best you can. You won’t reclaim new love. That flaming new love only happens when love is new. But you will likely find something that is deeper and more meaningful if you give it a chance.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My parents won’t let me see my boyfriend of 8 months. I am 16 and he is 17, and they can’t see what I see in him. He’s had a difficult life that I haven’t been anywhere near and I think that’s part of the reason they won’t let me see him. We’ve broken up twice before, but we’re back together and it seems as though he really wants to make it work. They say he is a player and uses me, when he’s never cheated on me or dated anyone else in the time we’ve been together, nor have we had sex. I understand that they just want to protect me, but I think they are going about it the wrong way. My boyfriend says that we should stay together even though we cant see each other, and I’ve agreed, but I also know this isn’t a permanent solution. I don’t want to ruin my relationship with my parents, but I also want to be able to see my boyfriend. I just want to see him, but I can’t do it without going behind their back, and whenever I try to talk to them, they won’t really take into consideration what I see in him and why I love him. I know that they’re trying be good parents, but I need them to understand that I love him and I need to see him. Please help me.<|im_end|>

 It is difficult when parents who love you are trying to protect you but at the same time this protection feels very limiting.I think it might be time for you, your mom, and your dad to sit down together. Trying to solve this on your own will be too frustrating. Ask to have a meeting with your mom and dad and explain to them your struggle — that you want to honor them but you would like to give it a chance with your boyfriend. Bring the problem to them rather than away from them. Move toward the conflict, not away from it.Ask for their help. Tell them the idea of just cutting the relationship out altogether puts you in a very bad place. Ask them to help solve it with you. Often this can lead to some shift in the stalemate.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I have been trying to figure out what’s the matter with me for the last 3 years. I was first diagnosed with depression and tried a bunch of SSRIs that had no good or bad effect on me. I then did a sleep study and was diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia. I was put on modafinil and it helped a little bit but eventually wore off and now I’m on armodafinil which has even less of an effect than modafinil did. The doc also prescribed Lexapro (which i’ve been on before) with the armodafinil and this time around it made me feel kind of depressed. The doctor took me off of it (this is a sleep doctor by the way) and explained that since I had a bad reaction to the Lexapro that i may have Bi-polar Depression. I don’t fit the signs of this but upon trying to relate to this condition I stumbled upon ADHD symptoms, how it is confused with depression, and how it can go undetected. The symptoms of ADHD fit me like a glove. I am forgetful, I lose things to an extreme that it disrupts my life. I have had anxiety since I was a child, I’m restless, impulsive, impatient, I have very bad fidgeting and nail-biting habits, I zone out on conversations, I have had drug and alcohol addictions in the past, I drink coffee all day and all night long, and my husband is put through hell trying to keep up with and clean up my messes, I even have to keep my cards and ID in his wallet so that I don’t lose them. I also am very unorganized and messy and I stress myself out and beat myself up for it on a daily basis to the point that I exert more energy fighting with myself to fold the laundry than it would take to fold the laundry. Do you think I may have ADHD? PS: most of these symptoms have been present my entire life, I have always had trouble in school but have been told I am very smart. The only reason that I graduated after years of Ds and F grades is that I transferred to an alternative school.<|im_end|>

Thanks for reaching out and asking about these symptoms. Because so many folks have given an opinion I would try to take some of the guesswork out of this and make an appointment with a clinical psychologist who does testing. This type of professional uses not only clinical judgment, but sophisticated tests that help to evaluate your strengths and relative weaknesses. More than this, they offer specific suggestions for how to deal with it.In the best of all worlds find a neuro-psychologist who does the testing as he or she may have even more specific tests to identify the problem and the potential solution.I admire your persistence in looking for a solution to these difficult issues.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I Do Realize That I Have A Few Psychopathic Traits, However, I’m Not Sure If I Am A Psychopath Or Sociopath. Recently I’ve started to question and compare my actions and thoughts to others. I’ve started to be more aware of myself. I first noticed that whenever I would be angry at someone in close with ( a partner, parent or best friend)my usual feelings that I experience for them disappear completely and it’s as if they’ve changed from the people I care about to the people that I hate the most. So I did research starting from there. I’ve then realized that I lack empathy, guilt, remorse, compassion, you name it. However, I feel empathy for animals, not for humans. This is what’s making me confused. Once I’ve hurt someone, mostly emotionally, I wouldn’t feel guilty, even after my feelings for them have returned (after calming down). I’ve also realized that I’m very manipulative and dominant, I hate it whenever I feel like I’m not in control. I become more aggressive. And once something doesn’t go my way, I play as the victim or I try to make the person feel guilty or pity me so that they can give in. I don’t lie often, mostly because I don’t feel the need to since I don’t do bad things, I don’t mind following the rules as I think that they’re fair and don’t interfere with my life. I do lie sometimes, whenever I need to, I always get away with it. I also have superficial charm, it’s much easier to do online, I’ve noticed that people would fall for me in a matter of days to even a few hours. I don’t think that I am very narcissistic because I do have insecurities but sometimes I would feel like I am better than others, but that kind of feeling disappears quickly. I’ve been told that I can be cruel at times, I do admit that I am, especially towards people I dislike. I also feel satisfaction in seeing them hurt. I have a partner and I do get tremendously jealous, to the point that it’s emotionally violent for my partner. I would like to add that I also get bored very easily. (From Canada)<|im_end|>

Thanks for sending in your concerns. Maybe the best place to start is with an adequate definition of the terms you’ve used: psychopath and sociopath. Perhaps understanding more about each of these will be helpful.First is to understand that psychopath and sociopath are pop psychology terms that are manifestations of an antisocial personality disorder, which means that they share the common traits of disregarding others rights and safety while being deceptive and manipulative. In spite of how these personalities are portrayed in Hollywood, neither is necessarily violent.The main instrument for diagnosing people with antisocial personality disorder comes from The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ( DSM-5), which defines antisocial personality as an individual with 3 or more of the following traits:To determine if your behaviors match this criteria here is a brief quiz that is not meant to diagnose but help you understand more about these concerns.The place to look for understanding the origin of an antisocial personality disorder is in childhood. The pattern of behavior often begins with four different categories classified as conduct disorders and include: People with these symptoms are at greater risk for antisocial personality disorder.The best way to find out more is to talk to a professional. A clinical psychologist can conduct a series of tests along with an interview to help determine what your symptoms mean. Since you list your age as 16 I’d recommend asking your parents to help set up a meeting.Finally, your email and asking these questions is an important element, perhaps, the most important, in understanding your true character. Your desire to learn more about yourself and understand who you are is the hallmark of someone who wants to grow. Of all the things you’ve mentioned this is the strongest, and the most important for you to capitalize on going forward.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: My wife has always had male friends. She has sent very inappropriate texts to men in the past but since has stopped. But she is still messaging or snap-chatting other men and becomes angry when I ask her about it.<|im_end|>

It’s very painful to love someone who doesn’t return it in kind and degree. It’s like when someone doesn’t respond to a handshake. Your hand is out there but at some point it hurts to not have it clasped.People in healthy marriages are honest and up front with each other. They don’t password their devices. They don’t hesitate to share their correspondence. Their relationship fills enough of their needs enough of the time that they don’t need to look for more with other people. You already know that — which is why you aren’t content to settle for the marriage you’ve got.My guess is that your wife needs to feel pursued by other men in order to feel good enough. That’s not something you can fix, no matter how attentive you are. Your marriage will only last as long as you are willing to put up with the one sidedness — or until she does find someone who will shore up her self-esteem by pursuit — at least for awhile.What you can do is insist that the two of you get into couple counseling. It’s possible that a counselor will be able to address your wife’s insecurities and her need to build her self-esteem by contacting other men. It’s possible there are things you are doing or not doing that contribute to her problems. It’s worth a few sessions to find out. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.If therapy isn’t helpful, at least you will always know that you gave it your best try.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From a young man in India: Hi. I am married from last 4 years. Before my marriage I was in very deep relationship with another girl. We have tried to get married but because of the caste issues we couldn’t get married.

 Since you have brought a child into the world, I suggest you work hard at making your marriage work. It doesn’t surprise me that your relationship with your wife isn’t good. She probably senses that you are not committed to her. She is probably both angry and frightened that you will leave her and your daughter. She argues out of her unhappiness.Stop thinking about the other woman. Let her get on with her life. Get on with yours. Be the best husband you can be, and see how your wife responds. Don’t argue when she is upset with you. Instead, just ask her what you can do to help her be happier. That doesn’t mean you should accept abuse. It does mean that you look beyond the critical comments to her unhappiness and try to respond to that.Give it time. It will take time and effort on your part to make your marriage a good one. But it is worth making the effort.All three of you: You, your wife, and especially your little girl deserve to have a peaceful and happy family life. If you can’t make it work, you will be able to separate knowing that you did the honorable thing and tried your best.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Over the past year I have developed some unusual ways of thinking and behavior that I have no idea how to handle. I have become more and more socially withdrawn. I never leave my house, and rarely get out of bed. My fiance has been trying to get me to be more active socially and physically, but I somehow always end up staying home. This has gone on for over a year and has become worse and worse as each day passes. It’s not that I’m scared to leave my house, I just don’t want to deal with people, and I am paranoid that everywhere I go people are watching me, talking about me, and judging me. Next, I have become very unorganized. I used to be a complete control freak and now I have piles and piles of clothes everwhere, dirty dishes, food wrappers etc, and I have no interest in cleaning because I know where everything is. Next (This scares my fiance the most) I have become very paranoid and scared about demons. I think they are out to get me. I somehow convice myself that when I open the door to my room, or the shower curtain, or when I look in the mirror a demon will appear and try to hurt me. I constantly think about this and it keeps me from getting out of bed, getting out of the shower, and looking in the mirror. When I lay in bed at night and close my eyes, I always feel like a demon is hovering over me. Or when I am home alone, I feel like they follow me around and end up running everywhere I go. The fear is paralyzing. Next, I have trouble concentrating and communicating with my fiance and family because my head is so cluttered with thoughts. There’s always a million different thoughts going on at once, some I can make out, some I can not. Some are whispered thoughts, and some are screaming thoughts that won’t go away. They all have different tones of voices, some more aggresive than others. I don’t know if I am making any sense. This is my most recent symptom, and it’s keeping me from falling asleep. Over the year I have also started to neglect my personal hygeine because of what’s going on inside of my head. If I don’t go out, I won’t shower or brush my teeth for weeks. I sometimes don’t eat for a few days, because I’m scared to leave my bed. I even onnce urinated in a trashcan because I was paranoid to leave my room, because my roommate had company and I did not want to deal with people. These symptoms are starting to ruin my life and I don’t know what to think of them. I know they are not normal. What do you think it is, and what are some steps I can take in dealing with this?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You are correct to be concerned. Your symptoms include a combination of extreme anxiety and fear, paranoia, hearing voices, and an overall decompensation of your ability to perform normal everyday activities, such as showering. This situation requires professional intervention.You should make an appointment with a mental health professional immediately. Without treatment, the symptoms will very likely worsen and you risk the development of a full-blown psychotic episode. Seeking professional help might prevent psychosis.If you feel that you cannot leave your home, then call emergency services or the local mental health crisis team. Many communities have crisis teams who can come to the home, assess the situation and determine the most appropriate intervention.Many people have had exactly the same symptoms that you are now experiencing. Treating these symptoms now is likely to bring you major relief and return your life to the way it was before.It is important that you seek professional treatment. As time progresses, your symptoms are clearly worsening and require immediate attention. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Hi there! well I just moved back to the states two months ago, i used to live here in 2008 and but i had too many emotional problems to stay with my dad. The thing is over my entire life i’ve had problems, mood swings, anger (but its like something i keep for myself and then explote to someone) i’ve been depressed, Im never happy, i dont like going out alone TO ANYWHERE. My entire life i’ve had to deal with myself, i just have one friend, and the family i used to lived with (my aunt and my granpa) never believe me when i say “im not okay, i need help” my father doesnt believe me neighter, the only person who tought i might had something “wrong” was my mother. I went to a therapist one time but I never wanted to tell him about all my problems and most of the time i missed the appointment cause i wasnt in the mood to go out of my house. One of my aunts told me to go to him so he could help me deal with my mom loss. She killed herself a year ago. 3 months before she died she told me that she wanted to take me to “this lady” because she thought something bad was going on with me, i never went with her, we never had a good relationship it was too hard to do it that was why i lived with my grandparent since i was 3 years old. Now im in this ccountry I dont have friends here, i live alone with my dad, i dont know noone besides his wife and my sister,brother… I told him i wanted to go to a therapist but he doesnt want to, everyone thinks im just being dramatic, or that i just to call their attention but its not that i want to do it. I want to wake up ad feel happy for another day of life but i CANT i hate to live i hate to be me. i have the disire to do something one min and then i dont do something about it. im tired of triying to be different, I cant feel happy, everyday its getting worse. two weeks ago i felt happy for a couple of hours but then i was back to the same, having no intersting in life, wanting to sleep all day or just watch tv, feeling like sh**t, hating myself.<|im_end|>

 The most important part of your letter is that you are reaching out for some help. You’re right. You do need someone to talk to. I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of only a letter but social anxiety would be a reasonable guess, given what you’ve told me. You’re also probably grieving both the loss of your mother and the loss of the life you thought you had. It’s a lot to handle.The Boys and Girls Town organization has a hotline for teens like you. Many young people are in the same situation, with parents who can’t or won’t understand. Take a look at their website to get an idea of the services they offer. There are counselors available 24/7 to talk with you when you are feeling low or when you don’t know where to turn. The phone number is 800-448-3000.Secondly, click on the “Find Help” tab on the PsychCentral homepage. I checked. There are at least 8 therapists listed in your city. However, they don’t indicate if they speak Spanish. I suggest you contact your doctor or call your local mental health clinic to get recommendations for Spanish-speaking counselors. You’re right. It’s generally easier for people to talk about the things that matter most to them in their own language. Don’t give up on the idea of finding a good counselor who speaks Spanish without putting in some effort to find them.When you do find a therapist, please give yourself the gift of an honest try at the process. You need to tell the therapist what’s really going on with you — all of it. It might help to bring the letter you sent to us here at PscyhCentral with you as a way to get started. Sadly, counselors can’t read minds. We only have what we’re given by our clients to work with. It’s like making bread. If someone only gives me the milk, eggs, and sugar but doesn’t give me the flour, I can’t make a loaf no matter how hard I try. Your counselor needs to know as much about you as possible if he or she is to help you make sense of things.You made a good start at helping yourself by writing to us. Now, please, take the next step. You have suffered long enough.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I am concerned that I may have PTSD due to childhood trauma, emotionally, physically. My mom is bipolar and raised me on her own in an unstable world. I also was sexually abused once at 6 yrs old. Sometimes in social situations I panic or am just not ready to socialize, I kinda have to gear up for it. When I feel attacked or unstable I respond with anger uncontrollably. I took a few quizzes, It said I may have BPD, OCD, or ADD.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m very glad you wrote. Please give yourself credit for the inner strength you must have that allowed you to come through your childhood experiences as well as you did. I’m impressed that now that you are in your 20s, you are trying to figure out the many conflicting feelings you have. It’s a difficult but important process — made especially so since your mother seems to continue to be in a mutually abusive relationship. You want to be sure that you aren’t going to repeat the kind of relationship you observed and experienced while growing up.Internet quizzes, even those on the PsychCentral website, are not intended to be diagnostic. They are only intended to provide information as a starting point for those, like yourself, who sense that something is wrong. I don’t know if you have BPD, OCD, or ADD. Neither do you. What I do know is that the results of the quizzes confirm that you have troubling thoughts and feelings that need attention.I encourage you to take the next step in your healing process. Make an appointment with a trained mental health counselor who can hear your whole story and help you understand yourself better. You deserve it. Your relationship with your boyfriend deserves it. You deserve to be able to take in the love and support that is being offered to you.One more thing: Your brother’s decision not to be involved with your mother may be his solution for avoiding being hurt by her any more. Since it “kills” you, I do suggest you talk to him about it. Listen to him with compassion. It may be the only way he has found to take care of himself. It isn’t your place to try to “fix” his relationship with his mother. That’s between the two of them. Whether or not you agree with his position, you can have a positive relationship with your brother — and you can come to your own conclusion about what kind of connection, if any, you want with your mother.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I feel really depressed a lot of the time sometimes I feel completely numb and empty and my I get shooting pains in my heart, and other times I feel so panicked and frustrated and my heart beets out of my chest. the problem I face is that I don’t really want to let people know how I feel as I’m extremely worried it might worry or upset them. for instance I feel really suicidal and I really can’t face telling my parents for instance because I love them so much and it would really upset them and maybe even possibly drive them to there own serous problems (as they have problems with alcohol and depression themselves). I see a therapist and I don’t really think that is helping much, partly because I find it so difficult to talk to anyone about this stuff let alone people I don’t know very well and because I find it hard to expresses the such strong feelings of sadness, self hatred and guilt that I feel. I would also speak to friends but I find that they can’t really understand how terrible I feel and I actually completely broke down and couldn’t stop crying for a long time in front of a couple of them which caused them to feel very uneasy and unsure of what to do and what they did try wasn’t all that helpful (saying things like “you should try and have a more positive attitude” and “everyone feels down from time to time”. I really feel so isolated and guilty. I feel so guilty because I don’t want my friends and family to feel upset or burdened by my problems and I really don’t know what to do. Often I feel as if suicide is my last option, please, please help.<|im_end|>

 You seem to believe that you are a burden to others. You are not. You are in pain and you need and deserve help. You are withholding your feelings from others to protect them but you are only hurting yourself. That is not healthy.Sometimes people feel that way when they lack the problem solving-skills to deal with life problems. Suicide should never be considered an option. Your friends and family can handle discussing your feelings far better they would be able to handle your suicide. Losing someone you love is very, very difficult.Your friends and family may want to help but are not sure how to do so. That makes sense, since they don’t have the training to deal with emotional problems.Therapists have that training. You are withholding very important information from your therapist. As long as you continue to withhold that information, he or she cannot fully help you. I would urge you to reveal these important details to your therapist as soon as possible. It is the correct way to handle the situation.If you feel that your therapist is not helpful, then try another. Keep trying until you find someone you are comfortable with.Millions of people have felt the way that you do. They sought help, received help and have now fully recovered. You can expect a similar outcome if you are willing to seek help. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 It is difficult to know what is wrong in your situation. The stress of the custody battle may be a significant contributor to your symptoms. I understand that you find it difficult to be honest with a counselor because of the custody situation but your self-treatment plan is proving to be ineffective.The most efficient solution is to utilize the services of a mental health professional. What you share during your therapy sessions should remain confidential even in the case of a custody battle. Consult your lawyer regarding confidentiality laws. He or she could clarify what information, if any, a mental health professional can legally divulge in court. Having a thorough understanding of the confidentiality laws could assist you in knowing what information is appropriate to self-disclose during therapy sessions.In the meantime, you may also consider other forms of treatment such as group therapy or a support group for divorced parents who also are struggling with custody issues. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings can also be a great source of support. During stressful times, some individuals find it useful to utilize the local religious counseling services. You may also want to consider stress reduction techniques such as relaxation, meditation, yoga, or strenuous exercise. The aforementioned suggestions may not “solve” your problems but they may serve to temporarily decrease your high stress levels. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care. <|im_end|>"

I was a victim of DV. Felony Attempted Murder and sought treatment to help me find my way out the PSD. I began treatment with a woman and after about 6 months we entered into a personal relationship. She spent Christmas day with my family, her birthday, movies and shared her financial woes with me. Her wages were to be garnished and I worked everyday for about a week to help resolve this issue for her. I made many telephone calls and did intensive research. About six months after beginning the personal relationship she summarily dismissed me after a session by not giving me a future appointment. No explanation what so ever. I became so frustered and upset that I just left. I have tried to communicate with several times for an explanation and have not received a response. At the least to me her behavior was unethical, unprofessional and down right mean. She has no remorse regarding the pain she has caused me. I believe she has done this before and will do it again..no one should be subjected to what she did to me. She has more than enough hours, a masters and her PHD and doesn’t have a license with the BBS. I am about ready to contact the director of the couseling service and filing a complaint with the BBS. Another therapist will verify my story as well as my family.<|im_end|>

 One option is to report her to the respective state licensing board. Even if she does not hold a license you could still report her. You did not mention her credentials. For instance, if she claims to be a psychologist then you would report her to the American Psychological Association state licensing board. If she is a social worker, then report her to the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) state licensing board, and so on.Virtually all helping professionals, marriage and family therapists, social workers, psychologists, and so forth have a code of ethics. If the code of ethics is violated they risk losing their professional license. You described having a close personal relationship with your therapist. It seems as if boundaries were crossed. If she were a professional social worker, she would have most likely violated the NASW code of ethics. Not only would it have been a violation of the code of ethics, there could be legal ramifications.You’re doing the right thing by bringing this problem to the attention of her supervisors. It is a good place to start. The next logical step would be the state licensing board. You should be able to find the links to the appropriate resources on the Internet by doing a Google search. I wish you the best. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I have been experiencing a decline in my mental capacity. This includes problems recalling the names of certain objects, remembering school work and generally feeling like my mind is blank. I’ve experienced this three years ago and I went to a neurologist who did an MRI, however at that time I was complaining about a numbness in my head which is what this feels like and at that time I also had insomnia, trouble concentrating. The neurologist said nothing was wrong with me however I should check back with him in case, but I never did (financial problems). Recently however things have gotten really bad compared to how they were three years ago, I remember staring at my laptop case and watching a velcro strap and I couldn’t remember for the life of me the name velcro. I only remembered it yesterday when I was reading a topic on materials that it was called velcro, bear in mind that I forgot the strap’s name three weeks ago. I even forgot my uncle’s birthday and my mum called and I had no idea it was his birthday until she told me. I constantly forget to do simple things for example I would leave my apartment to study but i would leave my charger in the apartment. Lately (2 weeks now) I’ve been sleeping a lot (16 hours), eating very little and generally missing classes because I can’t concentrate. Now I was a bit of a hypochondriac and I used to diagnose myself a lot using google (I still do right now I think it’s depression that I have) for example three years ago I thought I had CJD or FFI and I though I would die very soon. I also have bad anxiety which made me avoid people this stems from a rough set of teenage years because my mom had a mental illness and her episodes were very difficult,high stress periods. I stopped trusting people and in general avoided them for a long time(most of my life). Now I get stressed out around people even more (I think they see I’m pathetic) and I also get stressed out by myself now because I don’t know what’s wrong. I have thoughts that I may be making up my problems to get attention or that nothing’s wrong with me because some days everything feels normal but 90% of the time I feel horrible(memory problems,lack of purpose,difficulty concentrating,worrying,slightly suicidal).<|im_end|>

 If I were your therapist, I would be trying to determine whether your memory concerns stem from your hypochondria and anxiety. People with hypochondriasis are overly concerned about developing medical problems in spite of receiving positive evaluations and reassurances by medical professionals.You consulted a specialist a few years ago and it was determined that everything was fine. These same fears have returned but the question remains how accurate is your self-assessment?It would be advantageous to have an objective evaluation with a memory or cognition specialist to determine if your fears are accurate. That said, your undergoing another evaluation could reinforce your worries and increase your anxiety.You have had these health-related anxieties for years, but there was no mention in your letter about you having consulted a mental health professional. Having a professional evaluation is the best way to determine if your problem is psychological or physiological. Unfortunately, I can’t make that determination based upon a short letter and strongly encourage you to see a psychotherapist for an in-person evaluation. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 I do not believe that laziness is your problem. Nor is lack of motivation. You have the desire to complete your tasks but you struggle with the execution of those tasks. This may be more of a logistics problem rather than a psychological problem.Part of the problem might also be medication related. Feeling a lack of motivation is a common side effect of some psychiatric medications. A medication adjustment might be needed.Another possible explanation is that you never learned effective organizational skills. A simple solution to this problem might be learning new ways to manage and organize your work load. The good news is these skills can be learned.I believe that your biggest obstacle may be your reluctance to ask for help. Your reluctance seems to be driven by your belief that you will be judged as lazy. That is faulty logic and it is likely preventing you from getting the proper help.Your thinking needs to be in accordance with reality. The reality is as follows:<|im_end|>"

So, my fiancé and I have been together for 3 and a half years. We are 9 months away from the wedding and I find myself having doubts. However, my fiancé is wonderful. He’s completely in love with me. Our values are aligned, he’s my best friend, and logically we’re just a perfect match. And then just recently someone else entered my life and has made me question every belief I’ve ever had. I can’t get him out of my head no matter how hard I try to do so for the sake of my relationship. It’s not lust or a purely physical attraction. I just feel like I’ve found a kindred spirit in him and I think I’m in love with him. He doesn’t know how I feel and part of me doesn’t even think he would feel the same way about me because there are some barriers we would have to work through. One of which is that he’s one of my fiancé’s best friends. I know I need to sit down with my fiancé and tell him I’m having doubts. I don’t know if I should tell him about these other feelings I’m having and I don’t know how to figure out what to do to reach a path I want to take. Right now, it just seems like no matter what I do I’m stuck and I feel like I can’t speak to anyone about how I’m feeling because they will just all think I’d be throwing everything away because my fiancé is just great.<|im_end|>

 It is time for you to have that difficult talk with your fiancé. Let him know you have doubts because that is the most important thing. In the vast majority of these situations the other person isn’t more than a symptom of an uncertainty in the relationship.Tell your fiancé that you are having doubts and see how he responds. Going forward you can always use couples therapy (the find help tab at the top of the page will locate someone in your area). But until you hear his reaction it will be hard to plan going forward. He may have doubts too that he has been unable to air — so the first step is to talk about what isn’t working and then take it from there.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I love my elder sister very much and have not met her since a long time. I keep missing her too much. The situation has been so intense these days that I have started seeing her in one of my colleagues. I always feel like talking to her, making her smile, making her feel happy. I become very worried about her whenever she is not around. I always tend to disturb her, tease her and annoy her… just to be around her (taking my opportunities to be able to talk to her). But, I don’t know whether she registers it the same way as me. She sometimes makes me feel like she also cares but then some other time she will be calm and quiet. I keep thinking of her all the time… even when we are not in office, even when I will be somewhere else doing something else with some other people. She is all over my mind. With all of this I am not able to concentrate on my work anymore. I am becoming less efficient day by day. It’s like… the thought has engrossed my mind and it cannot think of anything else. I don’t understand what should be done to overcome this. Should I go and tell my condition to her (like the way I see her, the way I care for her)? Would that make me feel relieved? Would I be able to concentrate then? Or, should I remain quiet and let go? (She is resigning our office by this April). Will that aggravate the situation or make me calmer later on? (age 25, from India)<|im_end|>

 What may have started out as a fondness for your coworker because she reminds you of your sister sounds like it may have changed into romantic feelings. The amount of time you spend thinking about her and wanting to be near her, as well as the difficulties you have concentrating, sound like you are falling in love, or at least infatuation.I think it’s time to do some soul searching, and possibly talk the situation over with a good friend. Once you have clarified the nature of your feelings, then it may be time to speak to your coworker about it — but not before.All the best,<|im_end|>"

Sorry to waste your time with a problem that is completely my fault, but I have been free of self-injury for over 1000 days now, but it is still a fight sometimes. All the information on the internet seems to say find someone to talk to, but that is a lot easier said than done for me. My best friend is 9 years older than me, and is married with a baby and a full-time job, and doesn’t necessarily think of me as a friend, so she isn’t really available to help me very often. I don’t really have many other friends. I do have a counselor at school but she made it clear before break that she will email when she is ready to start back up and until then does not want contact with students so at least at the moment she is not an option at all. Also, she doesn’t seem to see my SI as an issue because whenever I bring it up she pretty much ignores it then goes back to whatever she must have planned to say. (Maybe because I never did anything that left permanent physical damage)<|im_end|>

 An unequivocal statement of fact is that cutting, and self-injury, is never a wise idea. It is always a mistake. Self-injury is a sign that someone is suffering and that they lack the necessary skills to deal with emotional pain. Specific reasons why you should resist the urge to cut are provided below.You have not cut yourself in a very long time and it is important that you resist the urge to do so. One thousand days free of cutting is a major success. Try to remain committed to your ongoing success.I would recommend that you find additional support systems that you can count on when the others are unavailable. You stated that you have a counselor at school. Perhaps you should also have an outpatient therapist. I would also recommend attending a support group. Your local community mental health center, outpatient therapy center or your school counselor could assist you in locating a support group.You also might want to consider journaling. The content of the journal could include the following: What has kept you from cutting for the past 1,000 days? What other types of behavior have replaced the cutting? How has your life changed since you stopped cutting? What positive gains have you made over the past 1,000 days? How would you instruct others to have their own “1,000 days free of cutting?” Answering those questions might assist you in resisting the urge to cut and it may serve as a reminder for why you stopped. I hope that you can remain free from self-injurious behavior. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Today my boyfriend told me that he has a mental problem. He said that he just sees people as people, he doesn’t really see the emotions and lives behind them. He said he’s trying to stop but it scares me that he doesn’t see me and think about how he loves and cares for me, he just thinks “that’s my girlfriend.” Also, growing up as a kid he was abused and neglected by a step parent when his own weren’t fit to take care of him. He’s grown up with his grandparents since the age of 6 with no remorse for burying animals as he has buried 7 of his previous dogs and killed numerous rats and bunnies. I’m so scared for him and myself because I just want to understand what could be going on… I want to help him and I just want to know a possible diagnosis. Please help me, I’m desperate.

  While I have a high regard for you love and concern, your boyfriend’s problems will need professional help. A history of being abused, killing animals, and no understanding of others feelings is a collection of issues that will need more than your love. I’d recommend that you talk to your parents, school counselor or a therapist about the feelings you have for your boyfriend, and they can help you direct him to local services while providing you with a safe place to talk about your feelings and concerns.It isn’t possible for me to offer a diagnosis for your boyfriend, but I will confirm your concerns, and having your own counseling is the best place to begin.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

 My mom may be having an affair and I need to know what to do.I’ve known something is up with my mom just because she’s been very secretive about everything, and normally we are very close. But I was getting on Facebook and she was logged in. She had a new message and it was from one of her old boyfreinds from high school and I read some of the other ones. she regrets marrying my dad and I don’t know if she regrets my little brother and I or what else but some of the stuff on there made me cry. And some of it was slightly sexual,and she put a picture of him in her wallet and said he was her boyfreind. By the way my dad drives a truck so he’s only home on weekends. I don’t wanna ruin our family. if I do I might kill myself. I just need to know what to do?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You aren’t the one who is in danger of ruining your family. Your parents are. Hurting yourself isn’t going to solve anything. I do understand that saying that you might is a way to tell us how awful you feel. I get that you love your family very, very much.Your parents have a marriage problem to solve. The life of a trucker and spouse is really, really hard. Often it’s lonely. Your mom may be interested in someone else but your dad probably also has some part in their growing apart. This is their problem, not yours. They both will always be your parents. They can love you and your brother and be there for you whether or not they can find a way to renew their love for each other. None of it is your fault or your responsibility. You and your brother are the kids in the situation. It’s time for the adults to act like adults and deal.What you do now is have a serious talk with your mom. You’ve been close so I’m guessing you know how to approach her. Let her know that she left a trail on Facebook and that finding it has been very, very upsetting to you. Tell her that you understand that her relationship with your dad isn’t your business but that you want very much for her and your dad to figure out how to stay together if they can. Also tell her that keeping her secret is too heavy a load for a 13-year-old boy. You love her and you love your dad. It’s unfair for you to be caught in the middle.If she doesn’t listen to you, think about whether there is a relative or someone close to your family who you can confide in and who you can ask for help. If that isn’t possible, do consider asking your school guidance counselor for support in talking to your mom.I’m terribly sorry that you are suffering like this. Turning the problem back to where it belongs – with your folks – won’t solve it. But is will relieve you of some of the strain.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I’m turning 18 in a couple weeks. I’m a female that has been dealing with Bipolar-like symptoms, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts since an event in my family at the age of 12. It has been a long, tiring road, and around January of this year I developed an eating disorder.<|im_end|>

 First, you are not taking my time. In fact, it was important that you asked for help. You found out that the earth didn’t open up and swallow you for doing so. Nothing bad happened. That’s an important lesson for you to take in.You are right to seek out treatment. The place to start is with a therapist who has some expertise in eating disorders and probably trauma. Although you live in a tiny town, there is good help within an easy drive. Click on the “Find help” tab on our homepage as a place to start. You might also ask your primary care physician for some names of local therapists.Since you are on their insurance, I do encourage you to ask your parents to support you in seeking treatment. They don’t need to know the details of why. You can tell them that you need some privacy and when you are ready, you will share what they need to know. Most parents of someone who is 19 are able to respect that. Don’t expect them not to be concerned. That’s what parents do. Ask for their patience and support as you figure something out for yourself.Once you have an appointment, take your letter and this response with you to the first session and ask the therapist to read it. That will help you open up.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I’m not sure if I have a mental problem, and this is the closest I can come to figuring it out. I have a lot of weird things happening to me, here’s what they are.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 First let me thank you for taking time to express your concerns in such detail. It sounds like it has been very difficult for you to manage. But there are very good things embedded in your concerns.First there is the fact that your behavior is radically different at home than out in the world. This means that you have the skills, but there is something that is inhibiting you when you are in public. This is a good thing because it means you have the ability and need to learn how to use them in places other than with your family. This is a different issue than if someone wasn’t able to have these skills in any arena in their life. They would have to learn from scratch how to interact. This isn’t your situation. You know what it feels to be engaged, and when you are shut down. This is a better starting point.Secondly, the part of you that is observing you to be this way in public is very astute and knows that the public behavior isn’t the true you. You are able to observe these aspects of yourself with depth and clarity. This self-reflection is the most essential ingredient to making changes.While going out may not be an option you can get help from our forums, or from our online therapists. This would give you regular places to talk and learn about how to bring about change.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I’m incredibly angry all the time, sometimes I don’t even know why. I practically live in the world I’ve made up. I’m currently in therapy for social-phobia but I’m too afraid to talk to my therapists about this. All my life I’ve been making up fantasy worlds, the earliest memory I’ve had of one I must have 3-4 years old and even then the characters have been killing other people or trying to avoid being killed. All my worlds have been incredibly dangerous, filled with people who have gone completley mad and there is no government or rules. I practically live in these worlds, I sit on the couch for 5 hours a day and just imagine them, it’s all I think about in school and on car-drives ( which is a daily thing usually we drive for 1-2 hours ). These worlds are all I care about I don’t currently have any friends, and when I have in the past I’ve never felt like I connected with them and eventually the friendship would just dissolve or they’d be weirded out by something I’d say. For example people usually are freaked out because I think I’m psychic, I just know when something is going to happen instinctively. Another problem I have is my anger. I get so frustrated by what other consider to be little things, a former friend recently began taking my lunch seat ( I’ve sat in the same seat everyday all year and she’d sit next to me ) and whenever she does I get so angry that I dig my nails into my elbow ( so hard that they nearly bleed ) it ruins my whole day. Whenever she and the boy who sits across from me get into a conversation I just feel completely enraged and can’t help but want to set her hair on fire ( though I doubt I ever would ). I’m furious that I have to go to school and have actually considered starting a fire there. I feel like no one can help me figure out why I have these thoughts and I just don’t know what to do.

 You are very fortunate to have access to a psychotherapist. I receive many letters from adolescents who suffer from a variety of mental health issues but who don’t have or may never have the opportunity to consult a mental health professional. In many cases, their parents “don’t believe” in therapy. In other cases, they may be frightened to request therapy. Many teens suffer in silence. Some live in rural areas where no mental health services are offered or their parents simply can’t afford the cost of treatment.I would urge you to utilize the mental health services you have access to. You may worry that your thoughts or fantasies may be too shocking. Perhaps you are concerned with how the therapist will perceive you if he or she knows about your fantasies. It’s important to know that therapists are trained to deal with all situations. They recognize that fantasies are just fantasies. What someone fantasizes about doing is not necessarily indicative of how they would behave. In addition, it is common for teenagers to fantasize. It’s actually quite normal.You have also mentioned that you struggle with anger issues. There are occasions when you feel the urge to harm someone or to light their hair on fire. You “doubt” that you ever would but you need to be certain of this. The most responsible way to handle these urges is to report them to your therapist. The therapist can assist you in developing constructive anger management strategies.The main problem, as I see it, lies in your reluctance to be honest with your therapist. I would strongly encourage you to report the information that you provided in this letter to your therapist. If you withhold important information, then he or she can’t assist you. Try to be open and honest. The more information you can reveal to your therapist the better he or she can assist you.I hope this answer provides some guidance for how to handle the issues discussed in your letter. Use the mental health resources you have available to you. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My cheating Boyfriend trying to commit suicide. I have had quite some issues. I had been seeing this guy for 4 yrs. and we literally lived-in together. I thought we were happy and perfect.2 months back, out of the blue I came across a sex chat of his. Gradually over a period of a month, he first said there were chats only, then he accepted having met some girls and gradually accepted to sleeping with 3-4 girls. There have been scenarios where I have spent the night with him and then he has dropped me and brought a girl, had sex and den picked me up. I kept trying to tolerate it n come in terms with it but am not able to. I love him too much n am too used 2 his presence. He cries throughout, puts up a guilty face n has literally left his job. He got his folks involved who feel he should be given a second chance, I myself am a believer of second chances coz I had issues in my personal life were I had got married young to this guy I liked n realized stuff soon n got it annulled. My bf knew about my past and I thought I knew about his but he turned out 2 b a player throughout. He begs for forgiveness and pleads 4 everything 2 b normal. But wen I look at him all I can think is what he did with whom. He tried 2 commit suicide n is now fine but am scared he will try again. It pains me 2 see him like this. There r times I feel like running back 2 him but I know I will make him miserable coz am not able 2 trust him. I don’t know how I can get over him. I feel depressed n suicidal too but I know suicide is not the answer. He is not letting me go n with d confusion in my heart; I cannot stop talking 2 him. I depend too much on him. I just have no idea how 2 stay alone without him. He is not making it easy 4 me. When he cheated there were no problems between us. His actions confuse me, hurt me. Please guide me…<|im_end|>

A; This sounds very difficult and I am sorry you are going through all of this. You boyfriend needs professional help and you cannot be the one to help him. The lying, sexual promiscuity, quitting his job, and the suicide attempt are all indications that he has some personal issues to attend to and isn’t in a position to be able to manage a relationship. As bad as he feels and as difficult as it is for you to accept, trying to have a relationship with him now is going to be difficult, if not impossible. I would strongly encourage you to seek counseling in learning how to be independent of him. The help you can provide your boyfriend is in taking good care of yourself, while encouraging him to do the same.Wishing you patience and peace, Dr. Dan Proof Positive Blog @ PsychCentral  Daniel J.

 “What the caterpillar calls the end of the world, the master calls a butterfly.” ~Richard BachYour heartfelt letter is certainly touching. While it may seem catastrophic, there is actually some good news here.This is perhaps the most natural time in your lives to make a break. Your girlfriend has now forfeited her right to be privy to your life. She has made a decision that has fundamentally changed the nature of the relationship. I would honor that if I were you. I think you have done exceptionally well with the non-contact rule, and should now make plans for your life without her. The work that needs to be done here on the couples side of the equation is on her side. For you — you must pick up the pieces of your life and move on.The good news is that it happened now, and not after a few more years of plans and promises and hope. Take her at her word. You want a full and equal partnership, not one where you will wonder how committed your partner will be.Start investing in yourself, and if she does want to reconnect with you, take your time in deciding if you are willing to be with her again. It must be a joint decision, not just that she wants back in.Finally, the good news is that she seems to have dealt with her feelings directly and has been very upfront with you. This is precious. I hear from people all the time how their partner has not been direct. Take this as a blessing in your life, and use it to take stock in your own.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From a 16 year old in the U.S.: I try to be social sometimes, but I seem to have a speech impairment that makes the tone of my voice seem rude, and hostile. I also have a lisp, stutter quite often, my voice cracks, and my voice is either too loud or too soft (To be honest, I’ve probably spoken more this year than I have my entire life, so I am just realizing these things now).<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Let’s take these problems one at a time. 1) The speech issue. You didn’t grow up with a lot of conversation so you didn’t learn how to modulate your speech. Most school systems have a speech therapist available. Check with your guidance department or your school nurse to see if you can have some sessions with the speech therapist.2) Inappropriate social interactions: This isn’t a matter of speech. It’s a matter of reading social cues and knowing social rules. As with the speech, the isolation you experienced in your family plus the isolation that comes with being bullied means that you didn’t get enough exposure to those cues while growing up. Talk to your guidance counselor about whether there is a social skills coach available to you. The good news is that social skills can be learned and practiced. You are not doomed to be conversationally challenged for your whole life — as long as you make the effort to learn.3) Polycystic ovary syndrome: You are not alone. 5 – 10% of women have this condition. The symptoms often include the changes in mood you described as well as weight issues. You need to see an endocrinologist for testing and for recommendations for treatment. With proper treatment, you will have the same ability to lose weight as anyone else.4) Beauty is as beauty does. Not everyone looks like a super-model. But anyone can be an agreeable person that other people want to be around. It does take effort. It does take being willing to get involved at school with activities where you can be with other people to practice those social skills. If there is a service organization at your school, please consider joining up. Look for other opportunities to be helpful.I’m sorry your parents don’t support the idea that seeing a counselor might be helpful. They may be more receptive to speech therapy, social skills coaching and an appointment with an endocrinologist. Take charge of your life and find the support you need by taking care of 1 – 4. It’s sad you didn’t get the past you needed. But the present and future are now up to you.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I think that you might already know what’s wrong. As you wrote, you have been depressed for about five years. In addition, your best friend is moving away. It’s difficult to lose close friends. It makes sense that you are feeling more sad than usual.Here are some actionable ideas to help resolve this problem. First, speak to your father about your “dwindling” relationship. If he knew how he felt, he might change his behavior. You should also tell him about your depression and how you are upset about losing your best friend. Make him aware of these problems. He may be able to help.Second, you should also tell your mother about what’s wrong. Ask that she take you to counseling. She could help you find a mental health professional who specializes in treating depression in teenagers. Counseling is one of the best treatments for depression.Third, consult a doctor about your cystic acne. If possible, choose a dermatologist who specializes in treating this condition. You might find a good dermatologist through Internet research. Ask your parents to help you find a good doctor. If the first one doesn’t help, the second one might. If the second one doesn’t help you, the third one might. Just keep trying. Not all dermatologists are equally good.Lastly, you could relieve your daily stress by journaling. Writing about strong emotions can provide intense relief. It could help you process difficult emotions and clarify your thinking. I hope these ideas help, if only in some small way. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

To sum things up, I haven’t had therapy since I was a child. Im terrified to seek help, but lately the thoughts and impulses scare my safety and others. I idealize a lot of things socially unacceptable, my only confidant said if I were to act or attempt such things they would have to turn me in. I have a hard time knowing whats real pr not, and if others are out to get me. Ive been suicidal n self mutilate my entire life, Ive almost lost it a few times. In 2013 I tried to seek help, I think I was suffering PTSD. After wanting me in group therapy I ran and never went back. I also have substance abuse problems, Im irrational and impulsive, and making common decisions is difficult. I shake constantly, always weak but sometimes feel invincible. I may be anemic but nothing confirms it. I sometimes see things that aren’t there but rarely. I dont like people by any means, nor do I have much empathy. To keep my relationships okay sometimes I fake or overly act certain emotions I know I should have. I crave power and glory, to a point it should be a concern, yet sometimes lack motivation? I know I have experienced depression on many,many occasions. There’s things I’d like to do but I know I never could. I’ve been anticipating a major breakdown for about 8 from suppression, hiding, and faking. Ive had a great deal of tragedies, sexual abuse, abandonment, various suicides. I saved a friend once as a teen, I cut myself fairly bad, but I succeeded in taking the box cutter away after he cut his wrists, throat, and tried to stab his stomach. It plays out in my dreams like I remember, when I awake many things I’ve suppressed flood my head. Overall though the things I want to do, the things I find acceptable etc. thats what is scaring me, also that I can’t remember things.. I guess all of it. The thought of seeking actual help, I know what I feel isn’t normal, but I fear what will become of me or my family if I go and completely honest.<|im_end|>

 You are making a mistake by not seeking help. The only thing that could “become of you” if you were to seek help, is that your illness would get to improve. Psychotherapy is a positive experience for most people.You may be ill-informed about psychotherapy. Negative ideas about it often come from a combination of unflattering pop culture stereotypes and fear. In order for it to be effective you must be open and willing to accept treatment. People who are willing to accept treatment can be helped. People who are unwilling to accept treatment can’t be helped. You can choose to be open to treatment or you can choose to not be open to treatment. The choice is entirely yours.The symptoms you have described could be the result of the trauma you have experienced. Trauma can cause many problems in life. Psychotherapy is the ideal place to deal with trauma. It can help you to correct your problems.The bottom line is this: if you choose not to seek help, then you’ll likely continue to suffer and may even engage in criminal behavior for which you could be incarcerated. As you noted, you are on the verge of losing control. Your confidant made it clear that he or she would turn you in to the authorities should you do something that warrants it. Those are indicators that you need help now. It is better to be proactive than reactive. The time to seek help is now, not after something bad has happened. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 My girlfriend and I have been together for 7 months now. Thing have been great up to about a month ago. One night we where setting on the couch. She had a really bad week of work because she just got permoted to a management job and she has been really stressed out from the week. She told me when she starts falling in love with someone that she loses all sexual interest in that person and wants to be mean toward them and start pushing them away. She then mumbled she has been like this since she was in the Navy and that something happened that caused her to be this way. And also she shared a email that she recived about Military sexual trauma and shared it with me and said that’s how she feels. She said all her past relationships had ended because of this. and she wants to get help. She told her psychologist about this the one she is seeing for depression and they are thinking of sending her to a expert to deal with it.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You two must love each other very much. She loves you enough to share her past and her fears, in an effort to not push you away like she’s done with others. You love her enough to want to help. That makes this situation hopeful.  As you’re finding, sexual trauma harms more than the victim. It also affects those around her. Your girlfriend has done a good job getting on with her life. But in high stress situations and when a relationship gets serious and sexual, she gets “triggered.” That means that the feelings and memories of the past traumatic experience flood her to the point that she has to flee. Staying in the situation feels to her like the abuse is happening all over again and she feels powerless to do anything about it. She therefore pushes the lover away or escapes by drinking too much. She knows that these strategies don’t work in the long run. But in the moment, it’s all she can do to get away from the emotional pain.Fortunately, there are therapists who specialize in sexual trauma. Do encourage your girlfriend to follow up on getting treatment. It is probably frightening to her to think about digging up memories she’d like to forget. Reassure her that therapists who do this work know how to create a safe haven for sharing and for doing it at her own pace. Remind her that if she could do it on her own, she would have done so already. Provide support but don’t push her. The original trauma was one of being out of control. It’s very important that she feel in control of her therapy.In the meantime, you and your girlfriend might find some helpful information at this website that I found by searching the Internet: http://mydutytospeak.com/military-sexual-trauma/ I don’t have any personal experience with this group so this isn’t an endorsement. It just seemed like maybe it could be helpful.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My mother has always been very controlling so when it came to graduating high school, I was very excited to be going off to college. However, my mother, who insists that she “would rather die than live without” me, continuously threw temper tantrums and complained to every family member possible until I caved and went to a university close to home. For the past 3 1/2 years, I have been commuting back and forth. I felt like I have missed so much of the college experience and have such little freedom compared to everyone else my age.<|im_end|>

Don’t let your mother’s needs become yours. Her unhealthy dependence on you must be assessed directly. You may want to enlist the help of a therapist to do this, but it needs to be done — and done with some compassion for your mother’s limitations.There are five things I would recommend moving forward.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I have been dating my gf for 8 months now and we havent been sexually active but we do stuff like exploring one another, she is also still a virgin. On april 15 this year we were doing stuff and she Happened to seat on me while we were naked, no sperms came out nor did i insert my penis into her vagina little did i know this was the beginning of a long pregancy on her mind. She was last for a period that month and she started to think she was pregnant so we bought pregancy tests over and over and they all showed negative she relaxed and then got her period, it was a relief for the time. Then she started been late on periods and started panicking again this made me buy her pregancy tests over and over again and results were also negative, we went to the doctors and they told her she wasn’t pregnant, she couldnt even do a pap smear because it was so tight, her stomach started growing big now she thinks she is pregnant again, i took her to do two ultra sounds and all said she wasnt pregnant, i told her she is gaining weight and not eating healthly, she thinks am crazy and that we don’t believe her,even the doctors. She doesn’t want to have a baby dats for sure so anytime this comes up she wants to do an ultra sound and i don’t have the money to be doing everytime, she says her heart skips a beat when she is stressed nowdays and also says i should just leave her alone but i know she doesn’t mean it and dats why i just keep going with her, we relationship isnt fun so much, we haven’t had sex and she also thinks she is pregnant whenever she is late on her period and with the stomach growing big she is so conviced. She doesn’t want to go to her doctors anymore nowdays always wants to visit the abortation clinic to do blood work and ultra sounds…..i think she is delusional..i just don’t know and last week she said she something was kickng in her stomach…..i just dnt know what to do.<|im_end|>

 What a stressful, difficult time you’re having. I’m so sorry. Love should be sweet and comforting and fun, not like this. It sounds to me like your girlfriend has very conflicted feelings about being sexual at all. Her fears of pregnancy may well be grounded in guilt that she is even exploring sex with you. She wants to be close. She has normal feelings. But then the guilt sets in and she gets so anxious she can’t think straight.Your girlfriend doesn’t need any more ultrasounds. She does need to see a counselor. Her anxiety is depriving her of enjoying her relationship with you and being comfortable with her own sexuality. If she won’t go to a counselor alone, go as a couple. With a counselor’s help, you can learn some new ways to comfort her and to help her be more relaxed about sex.Meanwhile, take a big step back in how intimate you are with her. She is too fearful to be nude or to participate in mutual sexual exploration. Stick with kissing and hugging until she gets the help she needs. As frustrating as that may be, it’s better than what you’ve been going through.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I deal with a lot of anxious feelings. If others are talking I am always sure they are talking about me and judging me. I worry almost constantly. I have trouble communicating verbally with others and freeze up when others ask me questions. I have to force myself to make eye contact.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 No one needs to live with this level of anxiety and confusion. I’m so sorry you are feeling so distressed.The simple answer to your question is “yes”. You should seek an evaluation from a mental health counselor. I can’t tell on the basis of your letter if your issues rise to the level of a mental disorder. But a professional can. If you need treatment, the counselor will give you suggestions for next steps. If you don’t need treatment, you will at least get peace of mind, knowing that you are one of the “worried well” people who, like everyone, needs to learn how to better manage social interactions. The counselor can also give you some suggestions for that.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My girlfriend’s father was very abusive and loveless, and her mother had to escape with the kids one night when she was 13. He was a slum lord and fought seven years of divorce court to prevent my girlfriends family from having a stable fresh start. She absolutely despises him.<|im_end|>

  I admire the struggle you are having to take care of yourself and the love you feel. Your girlfriend’s problems sound more serious than “anxiety” and I would encourage you to help her get a second opinion. Talking to trees, dissociating, and regressing to child-like behavior while being excessively dependent isn’t healthy for either of you. I suggest getting a second opinion and getting a better handle on what these symptoms are related to. Then you will be in a better position to know what to do.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

My brother’s wife had a stroke about a year ago. He is completely devoted to her. She has partial paralysis and slight trouble with speech. A few months after the stroke, she started accusing my brother of having an affair with a woman that lives 300 miles away. She’s now decided that the woman has moved a few houses away from them. She also thinks that he’s having affairs with every woman in the town and everyone they see while they’re together out of town. She will even say things like, “Who are you going to see on that plane?” When the plane she is talking about is flying over them. She is a registered nurse, and although she is doing these things at home, and making life totally miserable for him day and night, she evidently can put on a perfect act at every doctor’s visit. They all seem to think she’s doing fine, when we all know she’s not. She refuses to let anyone go to a doctor visit with her, to really tell how things are. What can he do? If he can’t legally force her to get help, what can he do to help her, or more importantly now, what can he do to help himself? He’s been dealing with this for months.<|im_end|>

 Studies show that psychosis is a possible complication of a stroke but it’s rare, with an incident rate of about 1 percent. Her delusion seems to be very focused. She might have what is called delusional jealousy. A set of German researchers documented a rare case of a stroke victim who experienced delusional jealousy, a syndrome which they referred to as “organic Othello syndrome.”In their 2012 case study, they describe a 49-year-old female with no history of psychiatric illness who had a stroke and subsequently developed the delusion that her husband was having an affair with one of her friends. The authors reported that she was unshakable in her beliefs despite there being no evidence to support her accusation. The alleged affair made her very upset to the point where she would angrily throw household items at her husband. She demonstrated no other psychiatric symptoms. The authors theorized that her symptoms might have been the result of brain damage suffered from the stroke. Typical treatments for post-stroke psychosis include psychotropic medications.It’s important that your brother immediately report these symptoms to her doctor. Though she does allow him to go to the doctor with her, that doesn’t preclude him from contacting her doctor. He could either call or write a letter detailing her symptoms and his concerns. The doctor might not be able to respond, given health privacy laws, but there’s nothing that prevents your brother from contacting her doctor and reporting his concerns.Your brother should also ask the doctor for advice about how to handle this situation. He or she might be in the best position to help your brother and his wife.In the interim, there are some resources that may be of assistance to your brother in dealing with the accusations. Dr. Xavier Amador has written a good book that many people have found helpful called I Am Not Sick I Don’t Need Help: How To Help Someone With Mental Illness Accept Treatment. The book provides practical advice for families dealing with a loved one who is experiencing a break with reality.Hopefully, once her doctor is made aware of the problem, he or she will be able to help. If not, your brother may want to consult other health care professionals who specialize in psychosis or organic brain disorders. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From Lebanon: Growing up I thought what my dad used to do was completely normal and I had accepted the bad behavior. But by the time I grew up I realized that having someone mentally abuse us with harsh words and sometimes physical aggressiveness, it was too late. Recently he loses his mind, he spies on us all leaving devices hidden in our cars. He and my mother have been seeing other people openly, they can’t get a divorce because he’s gonna make my mom’s life hell if she leaves (has happened). He wouldn’t stop calling and showing up everywhere and threatening to hurt her. And if she stays it’s all the same, it’s horrible. He’s even dating her only best friend to make matters worse. And he keeps pointing fingers and saying that mom ruined his life while all along he was the one who was always losing his temper and threatening us and making our lives hell. He’s pretty much normally a very caring generous person, but he’s lost that bit because there’s like a little devil in his head sparking up a thing to get overly mad about … this is not even scratching the surface of what I have to say but I’ve tried taking him to therapy. He just won’t go and we can’t afford a good therapist. I need help because I’m on the verge of breaking down. 24 years of my life have gone by with horrific waves of madness. I just need to help him. I don’t know where to begin.<|im_end|>

 Since you are 55, I’m guessing that your father is in his 70s. I suggest you give up on dad. You are not going to change him at this stage of his life. He sees no reason to engage in treatment. He isn’t likely to give up his controlling and abusive ways.Instead, focus on supporting your mother and yourself. Your mother probably needs both legal and psychological help. I don’t know enough about resources in Lebanon to offer direct advice. I hope there is a way to extricate your mother from the situation that prevents your father from tracking her and making her life miserable. She deserves to have some peace in her senior years if she wants it.As for you: I’m sorry that your father has been able to dominate your life for so long. You’ve done what you can for your father. Can you now just turn your attention to yourself? It is pointless to wait for him to show you the love and support that ideally a son should get from his father. From what you shared in your letter, the generous times don’t compensate for the abusive ones. His idea of a relationship is one of control, not love.It’s sad but true that not everyone gets the parents they deserve. Cultivate friendships with other men you respect and admire to fill that place in your heart. You may live another 40 or so years. You can choose whether the next decades are filled with more madness or peace. If you need support, do try to find a therapist or join an online blog. PsychCentral communities offer good advice and emotional support to their members.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I have two issues. I keep getting mad at my bf for the smallest things. We will be together for 6 years this coming July. I’m not sure if it’s because of my ego, my experience or my genes. My father was abusive towards my mother and I witnessed all of that when I was younger. I have passion for photography and recently, I’ve been trying to find a job in that field. So, I found one that’s part time and id have to work during some weekends. I am also finding a full-time job. I told him about it and showed him the page I found and at that time, he didn’t seem to like it and gave me excuses like my camera is just a basic one so how am I supposed to be giving clients that kind of quality. I told him that it was written on the website that they don’t really mind what camera I’m using and then he gave other excuses. I asked if he doesn’t want me to take on the job and he denied. I already suspected in the first place that the main reason he did not want me to have the job is that I may find a better guy than him and that we will have lesser time for each other since he too has a full time job. I also get mad when he doesn’t pronounce properly or has an obviously wrong grammar when he speaks to me or when he says ok to everything even when I say that he won’t be able to handle it (he would ask to carry my stuff when his hands are already full). We kept talking about the photography job that I was going to take on. He then said that he wants to take on the same job in that same company. I got really mad because that just doesn’t make sense.<|im_end|>

 One issue at a time. First, something isn’t right with the relationship. Your boyfriend’s insecurity is very limiting and it sounds like he doesn’t have enough of his own direction in life and wants to do what you do, control you, and limit you. This is draining you — my guess is that is where the irritation is coming from. I would recommend some counseling because this is now a long-term relationship, and it would be important to untangle these issues before going forward.Secondly, the vivid dream sounds terrifying, and I can understand your discomfort. I would recommend you have a medical or if possible a psychiatric checkup about this. There are several possible reasons for this kind of image occurring, and the fact that it has now happened several times and is unwanted makes the evaluation important.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I have a 23 years old sister and her behaviors cause anxiety. We moved to Canada about 2 years ago and since then I feel responsible a lot about her. Our parents are in back home and I feel I have to protect her and do as much as I can for her. She imputes to me all the tasks she has to do. She doesn’t eat at all in a day or she eats fast food (she is overweight), she doesn’t sleep in normal ours, she is depressed and doesn’t have friends at all. I can’t stop thinking about something will happen to her so bad bc she doesn’t eat. Sometimes I think she will get a big health problem or mental issue and I am trying to think about how can I deal with it. I try to help her and talk to her often about what she should eat or she should go to nutritionist or psychologist but she never listen to me and she says “I don’t know why I am like this, I want to change my behaviors but I can’t.” I just want to stop worrying, I feel sick.

Your sister is very lucky to have your thoughtful and loving care. Her lethargy, sleeping pattern, and eating behaviors along with her feelings of helplessness are typical indications of a depression. While I certainly can’t diagnose your sister for an email — I can say I understand why you are feeling the way that you do. Being around someone you love who can’t control their basic needs is a scary thing to watch and feel responsible for. I understand how difficult it can be to carry this burden when your parents are so far away.Yet, this might offer the very way to get some help. I’d encourage you to make an appointment with a therapist to talk about the struggle you are having dealing with your sister. The reason for this meeting would be for you to explain your worry and how to best help cope with your concern and anxiety for your sister’s wellbeing. Once you’ve made the appointment then invite your sister to come and help you in the session. Let her know you need her to explain what she is experiencing with you being worried so much. Your sister may not be willing to help herself/ but she just might be willing to help you by attending one session.A skilled therapist will be able to understand the issue very directly and may be able to offer some guidance and options for your sister. Helping you might get her in the door and in front of a professional who could help suggest where these behaviors of hers are coming from.

 You should not be embarrassed to ask for help. You’re doing exactly what you should be doing. In my opinion, you have actually waited too long to ask for help. You began experiencing problems in high school but ignored them. Had they been dealt with then, these problems might have already been resolved.Millions of people receive mental health treatment in the United States. These people include lawyers, doctors, high-ranking military officials, congressmen, senators, and so forth. They may have received counseling or are taking psychoactive medications.HIPPA laws guard your privacy concerning mental health treatment. Neither your employer nor your insurance company can obtain psychotherapy information without you signing a detailed authorization form. If you do not personally tell your employer that you are receiving mental health treatment, then they would not know.You are concerned that treatment would inhibit your ability to work in your chosen profession. I believe those fears are unfounded. Treatment would enhance the quality of your life, not diminish it.The best way to begin treatment for depression is to speak to your primary care physician. Ask for a referral to a mental health professional. PCPs are general practitioners who have many connections with specialists in the community. You can also try searching for a mental health professional by clicking on the “find help” tab above and entering your zip code. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My husband and I are raising our first baby together; she is 10 months old. We got pregnant on our honeymoon and have only been together for about 2.5 years now. We also picked up and moved from Arizona to Pennsylvania to be closer to my family and planned to take over my family business. Well when we arrived here, my father decided he’s not ready to retire, so we’re both struggling to get by with part-time lower paying jobs (lower than what we made in Arizona.) We spent a fortune to move here and don’t have it to turn around and go back (nor do I want to. Ever.) Husband and I are fighting almost every day. Over money. Over him wanting to move back to be near his family. Over him calling me fat. Over him teasing me in front of my family. Over him having a negative attitude about this town, this house, this job market. Over me freaking out about cleaning up after him. Over me needing to get a car so I can have my own life and get away with the baby for a few hours and cool off. Over me thinking he’s lazy for not spending more time and energy looking for a better paying job. I accuse him of not trying because I believe he wants to fail and move back to Arizona. He admits he feels that way sometimes, but then we make up and he cries and tells me he loves me and wants to stay and make it work. He sometimes yells at me that since I’m better educated I should be the one to leave the house and get the better job with benefits so he can stay home with the baby. I feel that’s unfair, since I waited my whole life and saved up to have a baby and I want to stay home with her and breastfeed while I work part-time from home. I can pay my bills and I’m doing okay; but I’m tired of making up for the bills he can’t afford to pay for us. He also offers no help paying utilities or mortgage, insisting it’s fair because he pays for groceries, car insurance, and the car payment. (I did not want a new car and resent him for buying something we couldn’t afford.) We are in over our heads, and honestly, I feel like a single mom with an annoying roommate who makes messes and stresses me out and doesn’t pay his share. I believe in love and want to make it work. I really do want to try, but I feel so overwhelmed and anxious. I’ve a history of some anxiety and panic attacks, and I don’t want things to get that bad. I’m scared, and I don’t know if this marriage and my sanity can both be saved.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 “Marriage versus sanity” may be a false choice. The implication is that maintaining your sanity may involve ending your marriage. Based on your letter, there’s no indication that you have tried any alternative methods of resolution. Thus it’s quite premature to consider ending your marriage.You and your husband argue but you should not assume that the marriage is over. It’s a stressful time because of your recent move and the lack of financial stability. Once either of you finds steady work, there will likely be less tension and fighting.I would suspect that your husband is unhappy having moved to be close to your parents. I can certainly understand why you would prefer to be close to your parents but I can also understand why your husband would not be happy being so far away from his home.In a marriage or partnership, often one person has more power than the other and through power or manipulation or subtle pressure the stronger partner gets their way. The weaker partner, though having conceded, does not simply accept the fact that they have acquiesced. They silently resent having lost. This resentment builds like money being added to a savings account. Often it leaks out or it can be suddenly released with the marriage ending in divorce. Perhaps your husband does resent moving to Pennsylvania. He loves you but he may not be happy living so far from his home. These are all issues that I would examine if you were in counseling with me.Your relationship could greatly benefit from marriage counseling. If he is unwilling to attend marriage counseling, then you should attend individual therapy. A therapist could assist you in decreasing your levels of anxiety and teach you effective problem-solving skills. A therapist will also assess how both of you may be contributing to the problems in your marriage.Marriage is a legally binding agreement. Your husband is also the father of your child. The ultimate goal should be to salvage the marriage. Marriage counseling affords you the opportunity to examine the relationship in a supportive environment with a trained professional who can teach you how to resolve conflicts in a productive manner. I would highly recommend it. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I am a sixteen year old female and throughout my life, I have moved cities very often and been to 6 different schools in 11 years of education due to my father’s career choice. Because I have moved around so much, it is very hard for me to make close friends now and to generally trust people. I don’t like making close friends because all I’ve ever known was that people always leave and they don’t keep their promises. I have no true friends that I’ve known for a while. I also have a hard time expressing my emotions such as sadness or pain to others. I’d rather keep everything to myself. How can I change this? I would really like to allow myself to become close friends with the friends I currently have.<|im_end|>

 What you are describing is very common in teens who have been moved about a lot because of a parent’s job or service in the military. It’s hard to settle into a friendship when you know you may be moving in a year or two. Many kids protect themselves from the hurt of leaving by never connecting. Sadly, that strategy means that you never get to have the kind of intimate friends that every teen wants and needs.The good news for you is that you are part of the media generation. It used to be that once a family left town, it would be rare for young people to see each other again. Now, thanks to Skype, Facebook, and email, it’s really easy to keep in touch and for relationships to continue to develop even if you move 1000 kilometers away. Media contact can help you bridge the distance until you can arrange a shared holiday visit. I know of many friendships and several romantic relationships that are functioning this way very well.Whether you get closer to the friends you have is a decision. It won’t happen automatically. It won’t happen because of fate or because the stars align in some particular way. You’re going to have to do things a bit differently. That means taking some risks with your feelings. It means letting others see who you really are. Yes, you’ll sometimes get hurt. That’s part of having relationships. But nothing hurts as much as loneliness and isolation.Trust your instincts. Choose a couple of people who you know in your heart are kind and friendly. Then start slowly letting them get to know you. Keep it light at first. Find ways to have fun together and to talk about things that are important to you both. As you get more comfortable, open up more. If you do, I think you’ll find that it will feel more and more natural. You just have to do it enough to get yourself used to being closer. At 16, I’m reasonably sure that you have what it takes to work on it.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 How very, very sad. I agree that everything you are observing is connected. What concerns me beyond the lack of reaction to pain is the apparent regression to very primitive behavior.It is indeed possible that she has reactive attachment disorder. When a child doesn’t have the nurturing and care they need when very little, the child doesn’t have a model for caring, for self-care and for socially normative behavior.Unfortunately, it’s also possible that your daughter has another mental disorder. Autism, intellectual disability, childhood disintegrative disorder and childhood schizophrenia all include some of the symptoms you describe. That’s just to hazard a few guesses.Without a clear diagnosis, therapy can’t be helpful. The therapist doesn’t know what should be treated. I urge you to take your daughter to a medical facility that specializes in childhood psychiatric problems. First, she should be thoroughly checked for any medical condition that may be contributing to her behavior. Then she needs to be screened by specialists in childhood psychiatry.Having a chronically ill or mentally ill child is as stressful as it gets. I hope you and your husband are also getting help for yourselves. Ask your doctor for information about support groups for parents. Often other parents are the best source of information, support and practical help.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My boyfriend and I are both 16 years old. We have been dating for about a year I broke up with him once because I just got out of a 3 year relationship and wasn’t ready to date again. But we got back together and he is so perfect to me he buys me whatever I want and treats me like I’ve never been treated before. When we fight he usually gets very upset and curses because he doesn’t want to lose me. We recently just found out his uncle was doing drugs and got into a bad fight because he was being distant and mean. I told him we needed a break and throughout the week he was very mean and pushed me twice. He’s never acted like this I think it was a lot on him at once. My mom has been in a previous abusive relationship and thinks it’s just going to get worse. He’s sent me flowers and a lot of apologies. He got in trouble with school and is still trying to be with me. He says he deserves the consequences and will do anything to be with me again. My mom will not let me talk to him.

 Your mom may have a point. I know you may not want to hear this — but your boyfriend pushing you and then having an elaborate apology doesn’t necessarily translate into him being changed. One of the consequences is that he does not get to come right back into a relationship with you.There is no circumstance where his bad mood and shoving should be tolerated: No circumstance. Right now I would invest your time doing more activities with your friends — and not trying to help him so much. It sounds like he has a lot on his hands, and a lot to deal with. Let him deal with it. If your feelings for each other are genuine he will find a way to honor you — and not treat you so poorly that he pushes you. He has a lot of his own work to do first.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

 This is not usually an indication of a mental disorder. It could be that you were a particularly imaginative and creative kid, and it was your way to create stories that you were too young to write down. If you were lonely as a child, it’s possible that you started talking to yourself as a way to have “friends” to play with. Or another possibility is that you were criticized for not doing things “right” and found that talking things through, step by step, helped prevent you from making mistakes. Or it could be something else. Without knowing you, I can’t give you a definite answer about how it started.I’m not convinced you need to stop telling yourself stories unless it is making it difficult to be around other people. If you can keep it to yourself and you enjoy it, it may not be a problem. It’s just part of the quirkiness that makes you you.If you do want to stop it because it is giving you problems socially, then what to do depends on the reason it started. If you are creative, you could start writing your stories or finding other ways to express yourself. If you are lonely, maybe you need help learning how to make friends. If you are scared you’ll make mistakes, you need reassurance that mistakes are only human.If this habit is troublesome to you, I suggest you see a counselor for a few sessions to help you understand how the habit is useful to you and how to reduce it by finding new ways to deal with whatever is at the root of the problem.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Well, ever since I was around 13, I’ve felt the urge to kill or seriously injure people. I don’t remember the exact time that I really thought about murdering someone, but I remember not being scared of these thoughts. They still don’t scare me. I honestly feel like I could do it. I haven’t told anyone about this, and I don’t think I will. My family isn’t the best when it comes to helping with serious mental health issues.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I wish you would have included more information about your life circumstance that may be causing you to feel this way. People who have a desire to harm and kill are generally unhappy and hurt. Often, they are the victims of abuse or bullying (by family members and peers). Their desire to maim or kill could be a psychological defense mechanism that occurs in response to the powerlessness or helplessness associated with trauma and victimization. If you have been hurt, then it’s natural to fantasize about overpowering the people who have caused you pain. This may also generalize to the public at large and go beyond the specific victimizers. For some others, they are angry at the world and fantasize about destroying people, no one in particular.There may be other reasons why people develop murderous thoughts, but it is always a sign of a person in distress who needs help. I would strongly urge you to ask your parents for their assistance in seeking mental health treatment. You don’t have to tell them specifically why you want help but only that you would find it beneficial to talk about what’s bothering you. You don’t believe that your parents would understand your request for treatment, but you could be wrong. It’s worth trying.If asking your parents is not an option, then speak with the guidance counselor or the school psychologist about this problem. They can help you access mental health treatment.Finally, if you feel out of control or that you might engage in dangerous behavior, either by attempting to harm yourself or someone else, call emergency services or go to the nearest hospital. Emergency personnel can prevent you from doing something that you would later regret. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Lately I’ve been treated really bad by my best friend. She lives with me because her mother isn’t the best. She’s been lying to me a lot lately and being mean to be all because she’s in a relationship. I just 20 minutes ago, found terrible things she’s told and said about me to her boyfriend. “She is…unattractive and fat..” “She needs to go [language] herself.”. She’s told him VERY personal things I thought I could trust her with about me…She’s told him my secrets…and recently so many people have told me I was ugly. I believe it. I’ve always been called fat, ugly and terrible. I feel like I’ll never have friends because I’m anti-social and have a problem with thinking everybody is thinking bad about me or talking about me behind my back. I spend a lot of time on my computer because my only true friends are my role-play friends. I’ve known my best friend for eleven years now and we’ve always been so close.. We would argue a little, but make up. Now it’s all just so much..Because this is the fifth time I’ve seen her say things like this about me to her boyfriends in a year. She says these things about me, and they are so hurtful..I can’t even handle it anymore. I don’t talk about her behind her back, at all. I’ve spent so long trying to be the perfect friend to her because I really care about her and she’s the one person I was able to go too. Now when I truly need her, she isn’t here for me. I feel like I’ve lost everything and everybody aside from my parents, and I’m not close enough to talk to them about everything. I feel worthless, disgusting, fat and hideous. For the first time in my life, I have truly wanted to commit suicide, but I know the effect that would have on my younger brother and parents..and I couldn’t hurt them like that. I love them so much. I don’t go out, I don’t party. I don’t do all the things these other teenagers do. I care about my parents, and I know that they know best. So I don’t fall into peer pressure and I don’t try to do bad thinks like do drugs, have sex or get drunk…I’m also home schooled, so that makes my anti social personality worse…It’s getting to the point where I can’t even talk to new people without going into an anxiety attack and sobbing for hours because I think they’re thinking bad things about me. I just want to be pretty, and I want people to like me. I have no friends, aside from my online role play friends, and I am VERY grateful I have them..I just feel so worthless and like I don’t belong anywhere. I am embarrassed to go out in public, because I feel so ugly.. I just wonder if I even matter anymore..<|im_end|>

 I’m so glad you wrote. You’ve been suffering with these feelings for far too long. It sounds to me like your friend is feeling competitive with you. You have loving parents. She doesn’t. She may not realize that she is tearing you down to make herself feel more important than she feels.I’m very concerned about how lonely you are. Home-schooling can be wonderful academically but it can also be socially isolating. Unfortunately, the very thing your are using to help you feel connected with other people (online roleplaying) isn’t helping you at all with the development of social skills. People in games can certainly be important. But it’s equally important to feel secure about your ability to get along with others up close and pesonal.As difficult as it may be, it’s very important for you to start finding ways to be with other people your age. The neat thing about volunteering for a cause, for example, is that you don’t have to be instant friends. You can just focus on getting a job done while you’re around other people. That’s often a good way to start re-entering the social scene. You might also want to join or start a gaming group for people who want to get together now and then to talk about strategies for your roleplays, for example. The point is to find ways to wade into new social experiences.If that is all too, too frightening, I hope you will consider some therapy. A therapist can help you understand yourself better and help you work on your hurting self-esteem. Therapy also provides a safe place to figure out how to build social skills.In the meantime, if you need someone to talk to, please call the Boys and Girls Town Hotline. Counselors are available 24/7 to talk to teens who are hurting. Their number is 800-448-3000.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

  It’s never “stupid” to be concerned about your mental health. Your vigilance is good. I’m glad you asked your question.It’s normal to hear our own voice in our head. It might represent our consciousness, but you are hearing voices that you do not recognize and that is concerning. More information is necessary to determine what might be wrong.I would like to know more about what was happening in your life when you heard these voices. For instance, had you experienced a stressful day or had you not slept well the night before? I would also want to know things such as: what is your family life like, whether you’re taking medication, whether you have ever had a head injury or have used illegal drugs, and so forth.I would recommend asking your parents to take you to a mental health professional. He or she will gather information about your symptoms, your psychosocial history and determine what might be wrong. Most importantly, the therapist will develop a treatment plan for how to best address these symptoms.Depending upon what might be wrong, the consulting professional might suggest being evaluated by a psychiatrist. Psychiatrists are medical doctors who can prescribe medication for mental health problems, if necessary. You may not need medication but you, your therapist and your parents can make that determination after gathering more information about your symptoms.I hope this helps you know how to proceed. You might think it’s frightening to ask for help but it won’t prove to be true. Mental health professionals know how to treat these problems. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From a teen in the U.S.: I’m not entirely sure how to explain this.. Recently I’ve been wanting something to be wrong with me. I’ve had depression for as long as I can remember and have gone to therapists for it as well as trying Zoloft. While going through treatment I found myself not even wanting to get better. Self harm has also been a struggle of mine that started because it brought pleasure/made me feel better about myself.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You are correct that this isn’t healthy. Although you have had some treatment for depression, it sounds like maybe you didn’t help your helper as much as you should.A therapist only has what you tell her to work with. Did you talk about it when you felt your therapy wasn’t working? Did you let your therapist in on your self-harming behavior? Did you talk about your feelings of detachment? If not, there was very little the therapist could do to help you out of the depression.You don’t have to have a “disorder” to see a therapist. It’s enough that you are feeling some distress and that you worry about the mixed up feelings that leave you feeling healthy. If you are honest with your therapist, you will get both specific help and support for making change.I strongly urge you to go back to the therapist who already knows you — unless you really feel you could not connect with her. If that’s the case, start over with someone new. Take your letter with you to share during your first appointment. It will jump-start your session.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

You are doing all the right things. You are a supportive friend. You are there for her when she needs you. You hug her when she wants to be hugged, and you don’t when she’s doesn’t. That’s what supportive friends do for the people they care about.To try anything more would be ill-advised. You are not a therapist. Encourage her to consult a mental health professional. It’s possible that she is experiencing symptoms of a mental health condition such as depression or anxiety or other cause. It might explain her behavior and unspecified physical health problems.In addition, encourage her to consult a primary care physician (PCP). PCPs often refer patients to mental health professionals when necessary. You might offer to accompany her to these appointments. She might feel more comfortable if you went along. Otherwise, you’re doing all you can. Good luck and please take care.<|im_end|>"

I met my fiancé in May 2009. At the time he had just separated from his then-wife. He saw his 4 kids randomly throughout the week but she had the house and he was staying with friends. She decided take off with the kids and tell him he would never see them again. At the time I thought if he ever gets to see his kids at all it might be weekends-I could work with that. Honestly, the thought if dating a man with kids, let alone 4 of them (ages at the time 2, 4, 7, 8) scared the living daylights out of me. Little did I know that 2 months later their mother said “I can’t handle the” a gave them up all together. My fiancé had moved in with me just prior to her giving them up (which was only a couple of months into our relationship to begin with). So overnight I became an instant mother of 4 unruly children. Now, it’s over a year later and cannot stand to even be into same room with them. We have them 24/7 and I get no escape. Their father is in the military and could get deployed ad I’d be stuck with them all by myself. We are planning a wedding for next year but I’m really having doubts if this is the right decision. I love my fiancé and he is a great man but his kids are monsters. We tried going to couples therapist but she just said my feelings would come with time. The sounds of their voices are like nails on a chalkboard to me. I don’t know if it’s because I feel they have ruined my life. I had a great relationship, a social life and money to do whatever I pleased with. I could sleep past 6 am and I could work at a job of my choice. I am well-educated and I’m stuck working as a waitress because I have to make sure I’m home for the kids to get on or off the bus so I have to work at night when my fiancé is home from work. We never had any money because let’s face it-4 kids is expensive and their dead beat Mom literally lives in a storage shed and goes to the bathroom in a bucket she wont even pay her child support which is a measly $290 a month for all 4 kids. I love my fiancé but I hate my life. Should I stay or should I go?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I think you’ve answered your own question several times, but I will play it back for you. Let’s begin with you “hate your life.”Each piece of information you have offered comes back to the fact that this isn’t at all what you have signed up for. What you love in your fiancé is his potential, not the reality of his situation. You love what he could be if….From your description it seems clear that these children will become your responsibility. The mother has abdicated her duty, and you will become the primary female, if not the primary adult in their lives. Do you want this? It sounds like that not only includes emotional and intellectual support for them, but also financial. If you are willing to do so then make peace with your decision and find ways to love them, cherish them and help them. But if you can’t accept this responsibility, have an honest discussion with your fiancé about your limits. Don’t hold back. Tell him what you are and are not willing to do. This discussion will help you decide if you want to add the legal commitment of marriage in extending your relationship.The military has some wonderful counselors for the family. I strongly recommend making the connection to one of them if your decision is still unclear.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I’m 12 and my mom always picking fights and she yells at me at least once a day. She also makes me do all the chores in the house. If it helps, my mom’s mom died when my mom was only 11. Then she had to live with my grandpa, who she says was mean to her but my grandpa’s always been nice to me. She always says she’s the parent and I’m the kid and I have to do what she says or else. Whenever I try to solve a problem or talk things out, she goes completely crazy and starts talking about how I can’t tell her what to do, even if all I say is “Can you please not yell?”. She always threatens me about cutting off my hair or recently she’s been saying she’ll take away all my clothes and buy me ugly clothes to wear for the rest of the school year. Whenever I start to cry she’ll say to stop crying or she’ll smack me. Also, it doesn’t matter what I say, if it’s nice or not, she’ll say “don’t talk back to me” after she’s done yelling. And then she’ll go on and on about how all she ever is is nice and all I do is pick fights and talk back. I never pick fights though, I try and stay away from them. I just don’t know what to do.<|im_end|>

 You’re right. Your mom is completely unreasonable. My only guess is that since she lost her mom when she was your age, she has no idea how to be a mother to a young girl. It also sounds like maybe she is scared of what’s going to happen now that you are approaching your teens. Many parents don’t know how to handle it when their daughter starts to look and act more like a young adult woman. They try to “protect” their daughter by making her look ugly and limiting where she can do and what she can do. It doesn’t work, of course. It only makes the daughter resent the parent.The yelling and fighting have to stop. You have six more years before you will be old enough to leave home and take care of yourself. You’ve tried to talk with her and it isn’t working. I think you need to reach for some help from another adult. You didn’t mention if your dad is in the picture. If so, that may be the place to start. If not, think about another adult you trust who would be able to help you and your mom talk about how to have a better relationship through your teen years. That might be a trusted teacher, a school counselor, even your doctor. You need someone who isn’t going to just blame and shame your mom but who can offer your mom some support and help. (It doesn’t sound like your grandpa is the right person since she says he’s been mean to her.) You can’t do this alone.If you want someone to talk to as you work on this, I suggest you call the Boys and Girls Town Hotline. There are counselors available 24/7 to talk to kids like you who are having troubles and don’t know where to turn. The calls are confidential and free. The phone number is 800-448-3000. Please give them a call. They may have other suggestions for you. They can certainly give you some support.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I think expanding your social networks is a very wise idea. Your psychiatrist is helpful but you need more than she can offer. The more that you can connect with others the less isolated and lonely you will feel. I would recommend a grief support group. Many communities offer these types of groups. Griefshare.org can assist you in finding one of these groups in your community.You might also want to consider volunteer work. Is there a cause or a societal problem that you are passionate about? If so, then perhaps you can donate some of your time working for those causes. Examples include: working at a soup kitchen that feeds the homeless, tutoring someone or assisting the staff at the local pet shelter. Volunteering has many benefits. It provides the opportunity to connect with others, have new experiences and to discover new talents. Many people find volunteering to be quite rewarding.Finally, I would also suggest adopting a pet. Pets can bring a great deal of happiness into our lives. Pets can’t replace our loved ones but they are great companions. Recent studies have shown that owning a pet can significantly improve psychological health and decrease loneliness and depression. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I saw two motorcycles race past my house a few nights ago than I heard a loud bang and glass breaking a second later. Then I heard a lot of screaming. I went inside to get a phone and I called 911. One of the motorcyclists had t-boned a car making a left across the street a few houses down. I was the second neighbor to the scene and expected the worst. When I got there the first neighbor was trying to talk to the driver of the car and the screaming was coming from a group of the motorcyclists’ friends who witnessed the accident because they were there watching the motorcycles race. I went to the motorcyclist and instantly knew he was gone and that he went in an instant. I tried calming down the spectators and getting people back until help arrived. A few of the spectators started to become hostile. They began throwing things at the nearly split in half car and yelling threats to the driver and myself. I became so angry at them I decided to walk away. I could hear police coming so I decided to slow down and redirect traffic on the usually busy road. Now here’s what I’m having trouble dealing with:<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It is important that all true citizens work to improve their community. You went to the crash site and you tried to help the victims but were repelled by angry observers. There is an inherent risk in riding a motorcycle. One small stone, one unseen pothole, loose dirt on the road, all can be fatal for the person on the motorcycle. Under the best of conditions, riding a motorcycle is more dangerous than driving a car. If you do a little research, you will quickly see what appears to be a rising national problem with a certain type of motorcyclist, who deliberately violates traffic laws and then runs away from chasing police. These motorcyclists have fled the scene, gone to great lengths to outmaneuver police officers and have reached speeds of 170 mph on our public roads. At those speeds, the motorcyclist will not survive a crash and his motorcycle becomes a lethal missile, if it hits a car.According to your letter, these motorcyclists were racing at speeds of 100 mph. Yes, they were aware of the fact that a crash would likely prove fatal, but they chose to race with their friends watching.It is not up to you or I to determine the facts. It is up to the police to do an investigation and come to their conclusions. Every good citizen, should do their utmost to help every police officer. Since the founding of our country, we the people have made the laws through our elected representatives and we have created a police force to enforce those laws. They are our laws and we should do our best to live up to those laws. We should be offended when anyone breaks our laws and if we are dissatisfied with any laws we should work hard to have our representatives change those laws but until they are changed we must obey those laws.Our police are underpaid and often under respected. They are not all perfect but then not all attorneys or judges or surgeons are perfect. We should do our best to get rid of bad attorneys, bad judges, bad surgeons, and bad police officers. Bad attorneys should be disbarred, bad judges should be removed from the bench, bad surgeons should have their licenses revoked and bad police officers should be retrained or fired.The vast majority of police officers are quite good. They serve us the public and we should honestly and sincerely thank them for their service. Never let us forget that they put their lives on the line every time they stop a car for a traffic violation or they answer a 911 call.We as American citizens should do everything in our power to help our police. We as a society have asked them to do a job for us and we should be grateful and fully supportive of those who have chosen to serve us.You should call the police department, ask to talk to the investigating officers and offer your help. Perhaps they will accept your offer or perhaps not but I would be willing to bet that they will both thank you for your offer and treat you with respect. They deserve that same respect and never less.If you feel that an injustice is being done to the driver of the car, in the social media, then you should feel free to post your honest and sincerely felt comments. Again, it doesn’t matter what you or I believe the truth to be, it only matters that which is ultimately proven to be the truth and that will certainly be best determined by the police, through their investigation. Thank you, for being a good citizen.<|im_end|>"

I have been with my partner for over 3 years. In previous relationships I have been cheated on and I’m bringing my insecurities into my present relationship. He has never done anything to hurt me or given me any reason to doubt him yet I always think he wants more or would be happier without me. I recently checked his email, which was wrong, but I now don’t know if he’ll ever forgive me for it. Although I found out he had been flirting with a women and he claims I would have done the same it doesn’t mean anything. I don’t want to cause problems in the relationship but I don’t know how I can get over my stupidity of being so insecure.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Thank you for asking this question. I think it is something that many others try to cope with.There are two ways to understand this. Both have value. One way is to say that you’ve been cheated on in the past and to believe that you bring this past experience with you into the current relationship and it taints it. The second is that you may be attracted to men who are not faithful, and you are confirming your suspicions. I am throwing my vote with the second.This doesn’t mean you should end your relationship. But it does mean you need to be VERY clear with your boyfriend about what is acceptable and what is not. You may want to look for an individual therapist or couples therapist to work this through. You can find some recommendations at the find help tab at the top of the page.His excuse is lame. You have a right to be upset, and ask him to stop. Your self-deprecating remark about your stupidity over being insecure indicates you are too willing to take the heat for his behavior. It is important for you to speak up and be clear about what isn’t okay. Him saying “it doesn’t mean anything” completely disregards the fact that it did mean something to you. It is important for you to honor your feelings about this and ask him to be responsive to your wishes. Otherwise, if he cheats on you he will simply say the same thing. I am encouraging you to deal with it sooner rather than later. If he can’t, won’t or gives you a hard time about it, move on. You are looking for a man who can honor your needs.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Okay first of all I’m at rock bottom to ask for help here but lately I’ve been having a problem. There’s this really scary nightmare I have every single night for maybe a month now and it’s when I’m alone with someone in a darkish place and I’m on top of them and I’m stabbing them over and over and I can’t stop, like my arm isn’t even mine anymore and I usually wake up around there. Now this would be just odd if it wasn’t for the fact that I also have scary but enjoyable thoughts. I see people and want to hurt them really bad no matter who it is. I love the feel and smell of blood and enjoy having it around me. I’ve killed small creatures and I can’t fully remember doing it except knowing their dead. Am I crazy or is this some weird but regular problem? This can’t be normal and has been happening since I was young. The first time I hurt something was a dying bird and it felt disgustingly good. Oh god I still can’t believe I’m actually posting this but it’s too awkward to say it to anyone in person cause I tend to be more confident in my writing. Uh thanks if you come across this. (I’ve thought about suicide a lot and wrote multiple notes but I don’t have the guts to do it).<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
A: I’m sorry that you are having these scary nightmares and disturbing thoughts, but I’m glad you are reaching out for help. There are several things you mention in your question that concern me a great deal. First and foremost, anytime you feel so bad that you would consider suicide, it is time to get some professional help. The suicidal thoughts, the nightmares, the violent thoughts and the history of hurting animals all lead me to give you the same advice: please get some help.You are only 14 so if you talk to a therapist now there’s a very good chance that you will be able to overcome all these issues successfully. Please speak to your parents about helping you find a good therapist who works with teenagers. You may not even have to tell your parents exactly why you want to speak with someone in the beginning. Just be sure to be very direct and persistent that you want help now. Your school counselor or medical doctor may be able to give you some recommendations for therapists.Don’t worry about being “crazy,” just focus on getting better so you can feel peace inside.All the best,<|im_end|>"

Since very early in my life I have experienced intrusive sexual images that have been nearly impossible to rid myself of during some episodes. Recently I have reflected on how these thoughts seem quite like flashbacks. They are always involving the same person and are extremely real to me. Almost too real for someone supposedly having never experienced the things that were in these intrusive thoughts. After these episodes I never want to be touched and am very reclusive. I also have quite a phobia of being raped and find interactions with men extremely awkward. I have always found stories and images about rape and molesting extremely triggering. For instance, recently I watched a T.V. show where a girl talked about an incident when she was raped. After watching this the intrusive images came in floods and I felt suicidal because they were so bad. For days after that I did not want to be touched or be around people. I also have always had an unexplained fear that I am going to molest children even though I have no plans or desire to. I recently researched symptoms of repressed memories/ abuse and was surprised that child abuse can cause many issues I myself have struggled with in my life. These issues include eating disorders, self harm and anxiety/panic attacks. I also have low self esteem and a feeling of worthlessness. I have troubles with relationships and a fear of being left and abandoned. No one has ever seemed to been able to properly diagnose me with anything so these issues have gone unexplained. My question is if these symptoms might suggest that I was abused as a child and the intrusive thoughts are indeed flashbacks. They are, again, always of the same person and I shockingly little recollection of this person, seeing as they lived with my family for four years.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 There is a good chance that your symptoms are indicative of past abuse. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) might also be a factor. It would explain why you are experiencing flashbacks and why certain images trigger an intense emotional response.Another possibility exists. You may have obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It might account for the intrusive images and your unexplained fear of molesting children. Some individuals with OCD become obsessed with the idea that they may harm or kill someone. They don’t feel as though they can control themselves.You would benefit from a thorough psychiatric evaluation. A mental health professional can gather an extensive psychosocial history and determine what might be wrong. Sometimes people exhibit symptoms of various disorders but don’t meet the criteria for any one disorder. A mental health evaluation could determine what disorder, if any, you may have. Choose a mental health professional who specializes in trauma.Once your symptoms are under control, you may want to consider hypnosis. Hypnosis might help to uncover repressed memories. One must choose a qualified therapist especially because repressed memories might trigger an intense emotional response. Hypnosis must be done with extreme care and should only be considered when you are emotionally ready. Now might not be the best time since you are still investigating what might be wrong but it is a treatment option to consider at a later date. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I have a question about seeing therapists. I have read and have been told by friends who have had this come up in therapy that it is not ok to see more than one therapist. I understand in principle, but I have a question. I saw a psychologist off and on for 10 years who was very helpful to me through a number of issues I dealt with. He was very supportive, which I needed, and he knows me very well. I felt i had gone as far as I could with him on problems I was haveing with ADHD problems and problems with schooling. I felt bad for him that I just kept failing to improve. I was referred by my psychiatrist to a cognitive psychologist, and he was helpful to some extent in a different and complementary way.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Thanks for writing about this question. I think it is an important one.The idea of seeing one therapist has been around for a long time, mostly so there would not be conflicting feedback, or more deeper concerns with transference, or the possibility that the relationship usually needed to make the changes in your life would be thwarted by a second therapist.But the thinking and the practice of this has changed radically in the last 2 decades. As an example twelve-step programs and therapy were estranged, now they are more likely to be seen as mutually supportive interventions. Couples therapy needs to be done with a different therapist than the individual, group work is separate from couple and individual, and trauma interventions may require specific treatment.Therapy has also morphed into a very different form than it was before managed care and other insurance matters. Therapy can have a highly specific focus, with specifically trained therapists who work with you on specific problems. I regularly invite my clients to see another specialist with a particularly different skill (such as EMDR) when they need it, and other therapists will send their clients to me when they need my specialty (For instance, group therapy).As far as the “service extender” status this is something no clinician I know understands. The core feature seems to be the insurance companies use this phrase to suggest a duplication of services. When this has happened I know the insured and the clinicians have written to substantiate the fact that it is not a duplication, but a different service. When I have to do this for the purpose of explaining the difference between individual and group therapy the insurance companies sometimes change their position. My suggestion is to challenge the insurance company decision if you feel strongly that the two therapies are different. The worst that can happen is the insurance company will deny it.So the short answer to your question is yes, you can. The one thing I would suggest is not to keep it a secret from either. Be clear and upfront about what you are doing and why. You don’t want the process of getting help run the risk of you feeling bad.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I think I should start off by saying I didn’t have a very good childhood. My parents divorced when I was 5, my dad was a meth addict, and my mom was always busy working to provide for us that I spent most of my time at my grandparents. I was overweight and very shy, and hardly even tried to make friends because of my lack of self confidence that caused me to always assume no one would like me. My mom remarried and we moved to Los Angeles, and my stepdad was very emotionally, physically, and verbally abusive. My mom always took his side when he would attack me because she was scared of another divorce. She wouldn’t let me talk about his abuse to anyone in fear of him getting arrested. I developed anorexia at age 14 and was obsessed with running to lose weight. I became so thin that I was nearly hospitalized. Eventually I came out to my family that I’m gay. I developed a great group of friends, my eating disorder was no more and I have enjoyed as much food as I want ever since. I have lost all of those great friends I made, some because of my own self destructive behavior (I have had a tendency to lie for years now, and am just now trying to change. I haven’t told a lie in 6 months), and some of the friends I lost because they were just genuinely bad people who turned on me. I have been cheated on in every relationship I’ve had. I was a straight A student in high school, having the highest GPA in my grade levels, until my senior year. Suddenly something came over me and I stopped caring. I started skipping school and staying home and sleeping all day. I couldn’t do anything. I didn’t want to do anything. I was very depressed. I should also add that my mom kicked me out 3 different times in high school each after my stepdad abused me. She says it was for my safety but I also believe she wanted to make him happy, because he didn’t want me around. It hurt more than I could explain. So I went to stay with my drug addict father who I didn’t have a relationship with, and then to my grandmas house. I just gave up on school altogether sadly. I eventually moved back to LA when I was 17 and my mom hasn’t let me stay home since. She has branded me as a bad kid. My stepdad texts me every now and then and tells me to go fuck myself. Anyways, I have dealt with it all relatively decently in terms of mood. I have always learned to just laugh it off and be the funny one. But 2 years ago I suddenly went through a very dark period in my life. I became extremely depressed, to the point where I couldn’t function. I had disturbing intrusive thoughts, which led me to be extremely paranoid that I had a brain tumor. I couldn’t even go out to dinner with family because I was so paranoid that I couldn’t sit still. There wasn’t ever even a reason for my paranoia or anxiety. It was just there. For months I kept thinking I had something wrong with my brain, because I would have constant headaches and intrusive thoughts and the paranoia/anxiety over everything. Eventually, after months of constantly talking to my mom and her reassuring me I was fine, I felt normal again. It all went away. I began dating a new guy and I was probably the happiest I’ve ever been. We were together for 2 years. And recently he moved, broke up with me out of nowhere, told me he was using me for my money and so I could drive him places, and his friends (who had become my friends) all told me they were using me too. I had a complete mental breakdown and I numbed it by smoking marijuana with a friend of mine. I smoked every night for 2 months and I was able to feel fine. However then it all started happening again. The constant paranoia and anxiety, the constant depression. I have begun worrying that I am going crazy, or that I’m skitzofrenic or psychotic even though I have never seen or heard anything that wasn’t there. I am worried about my brain again. I am worried about simple things like going to see a movie, or going to the store, and literally for no reason. The intrusive thoughts and images are back and stronger than ever. And I’m having extremely random memories. Like I’ll see a house on tv and suddenly my brain will remind me of a location I’ve been to in real life that barely looks like it but kind of. And yesterday I was at the hospital visiting a family member and a hallway in the hospital reminded me of a dream I had when I was in high school of a hallway that looked like it. It is all very bizarre and I don’t know what’s happening to me. I moved in with my grandparents hoping that I would go away, and although it has lessened, it is still very much here every day. I need help. I have never had a job and I want one, and I want to go back to school, but I’m so terrified of my anxiety and depression and paranoia getting in the way.<|im_end|>

 Thank you for writing us. I think your situation would lend itself best to group therapy. In group therapy the issues you have identified in your family of origin and with your mom and stepdad would be addressed through the process of interaction within the group. I highly recommend finding a seasoned group therapist and join an ongoing group. This will provide a safe forum for you to both get support and make corrections in you life. The Find Help tab at the top of the page can help you find a therapist in your area or you can look on this site.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Dear Doctor, I am with the love of my life and we are two peas in a pod, yet lately I have become so angry, rude, and sad for no reason I am afraid I am making it very hard for him to be happy. Our relationship is a dream come true, he is my high school sweetheart and we as a couple are incredible. None of our fights are ever about one another, yet they can become so mean due to my anger. Recently I have not been working much and he is very busy with his job. I have been with him for so long and am very used to our ‘traditional’ memories that when change occurs I tend to freak out, worry and cause an issue when there is none. This makes me sad because I don’t want to be the cause of someone’s unhappiness and I know I need help. When I feel threatened due to insecurities I lash out in order to defend myself however all it does is make him upset, confused and distant. Now that I have all this time to do nothing while he is busy I get angry at him for unreasonable issues. I know my behaviour is wrong yet I do not know how to change it. I don’t want to ruin my relationship due to my own insecurities though I believe I am. What makes me even more upset with my behaviour is he blames my unhappiness on himself. I need your help for I do not want to ruin a good thing for my momentary breakdowns. Please help me to understand why when everything is so good I tend to focus on the negative and truly bring it all down.<|im_end|>

 I am so sorry you are having these issues with your boyfriend. It sounds like the change in your feelings has happened at the same time there has been a change in both of your work lives: You’ve been working less, he’s been working more.This has thrown your world out of balance. And when this happens couples often squabble because each resents the other.I think a few sessions with the couple counselor would be very helpful to do each of you in finding ways of supporting each other.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: This is an issue I’ve hidden for decades, but it’s become vastly more acute over the last 1.5 years since a cancer diagnosis.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Thank you for writing. You are describing what may be the symptoms of a clinical depression. It is not an unusual reaction to diagnosis of a life-threatening illness. Many cancer patients report feelings much like yours. I deeply sympathize. The fear and uncertainty of a cancer diagnosis and the pain of treatment sends many people into a very dark place.You survived but you aren’t fully alive. You are already acting as if you died, when you have been given a chance to make the most of living. Rather than searching anew for meaning, your depressed self has embraced a philosophy of meaningless. The cancer didn’t kill you but your emotional reaction is stealing your life.The way out is to get mental health treatment to help you reexamine your thinking and rebuild your life. Please look for a therapist who specializes in working with cancer survivors. In addition, check with your local hospital to see if there is a cancer patient support group. You are not alone. There are many others on the same journey who have worked themselves out of the darkness and who can provide you with practical help and emotional support.Since you are a philosophical person, I do suggest you read or re-read Viktor Frankl’s book Man’s Search for Meaning. It may give you some helpful perspective.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I have a mind which pokes me unnecessarily with negative rubbish. I know a negative thought will come – and I say myself DON’T think about it – but, I give in and the thought pokes me and “pulls me down”.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Two possibilities come to mind. The first is an unquiet mind. People meditate in order to quiet their minds. Meditation is the practice of focusing one’s attention and awareness. You might try meditation to gain control over your thoughts.A second possibility is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is an anxiety disorder. People with OCD commonly experience intrusive thoughts. They are thoughts and images that are unwelcome and distressing. People often describe them as “coming out of nowhere” and lack the control to stop them from occurring.The solution to this problem is counseling. These are exactly the types of problems that psychotherapy is designed to resolve. Contact a local therapist and meet with them in person. They would be in the best position to know what might be wrong and most importantly, how to treat it.One final thing. You are not a “loser” for struggling with this issue. That type of thinking makes it more difficult to accept treatment. Anxiety is one of the most common conditions in the world and it’s easily rectified with treatment. The sooner you begin treatment, the sooner this issue can be remedied. Good luck and please take care.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: Hey. I’m a single mother of a 16-year-old boy. I’m a teacher. I know whats normal behavior for a teenage. I’ve seen him talking to a blank space, getting so angry and trying to hurt me. As a child he tried to drown his best friend. I read his journal (I know but I’m just concerned) He has in it fantasies about murder, rape, torture. And he expressed an extreme fear of being humiliated, and that he is. I warned his school. But he just keeps getting angrier.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m terribly sorry that you are in this situation. It’s a parent’s nightmare to see a child they love headed for trouble and to feel so helpless to change it.I do share your concern. If he has been able to fool several psychiatrists, it will be difficult to get your son into treatment. However, I do encourage you to take him to your local crisis team for an evaluation if he talks to a “blank space” and to call the police if he ever tries to hurt you again.There is something you can do: Go for therapy yourself. Develop a relationship with a therapist who specializes in adolescent behavior and who can be both a sounding board and a resource for you. You need and deserve the support of having someone hear what you are dealing with on a regular basis. It may also be that on learning details, an experienced therapist will be able to give you some guidance about how to get help for your son.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Just last night I woke up and walked by my mothers bedroom door and heard her talking to her self, so I sat there and listened for a good minute or two, and decided to open the door, I asked her, are you alright? she responded with “that’s what I was going to tell you”, I then said “do you know you were sitting in your room talking to yourself in the dark?” she proceeded to tell me “that’s what I wanted to tell you”, it seemed as if she was trying to ignore what I just said, so I asked her if she noticed it and she said “no”. She is always talking to herself in the shower and anytime that I have my door closed.<|im_end|>

 Yes, your mother needs to be evaluated by a physician and a mental health professional. A physician can rule out medical problems. A mental health professional could help to determine if she is experiencing a relapse. It is not normal to hear voices. It may be a sign of psychosis, which in your mother’s case may be indicative of a relapse. Psychosis is associated with multiple mental health disorders but mainly bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.In the case of psychosis, “time is of the essence.” Generally, symptoms of psychosis become more severe and more pronounced over time. It is unlikely that her symptoms will simply go away. Intervention is often required to decrease or stop the worsening of a psychotic episode.Hopefully, your mother is willing to seek treatment. If she is unwilling, then you may have to try to force her into treatment. That is an unfortunate circumstance that too many families face.Escort her to the appointment or the hospital if possible. It is important to report the symptoms that you have witnessed, even if she will not allow you to be in the room while she is undergoing an evaluation. She may not be willing or able to report her symptoms accurately. The more information that the doctors have about her condition, the better they will be able to treat her condition. I hope that your mother is able to get the proper help. I wish you the best. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 Thank you for allowing me to answer your concerns. What seems clear from your description is that you’re creating the problem. This often happens when there it’s a struggle to be in an intimate relationship. You may want to ask yourself why do you keep blowing it up? By your own words you say you were picking a fight, causing a riff, and forcing him to shut down.My suggestion is to enter into individual therapy to find out why you’re pushing him away. You’re saying, other than the problems you were generating, he’s a good man. Divorcing him without looking at the source of the conflict within yourself would only likely allow the issue to occur again in the next relationship.I find out what’s causing you to alienate your husband.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Please help me with advice. I am disabled and on social benefit. Am 28 years old. I have no one in my life and even though my main diagnosis is paranoid schizophrenia I have sadly these incurable, negative symptoms. My family is in ruins. Father is in prison and blocking rest of us life. My mother’s health is getting weaker and my brother is going his own way. My mother can’t sell our properties since father disputes over them. Court might take for expenses our properties. My father isn’t cooperating and I have no one in life. Toxic mother and brother who doesn’t communicate with me anymore. I wanted to make my mother happy so she isn’t alone so I helped her find her lover over dating sites. This man is also financially helping us. But I am always either alone or with my mother (sometimes with her lover). I have no one and no love. She says we will live after their (parents) death. I can inherit as disabled survivors pension only after their death. I can star t life after their death. I can’t sleep for days, I have tremors and I barely eat. I constantly cry because I have girl from Philippines which I love. She is only light I have. But knowing I won’t be able to be with her many many years is killing me. I can’t stop crying and with her I burst in tears. I am falling apart. She is comforting me and I consider suicide, but she doesn’t allow me. Pain is too much. I promised her to be with her and marry her next year. But it may be longer… All the way until first parent dies. I can’t work since my work capability is revoked. If I start working I loose right to inherit survivors pension which is around 1000$. I would never earn that much by work and part time doesn’t exist. Competition ran over me in freelancing. I can’t do anything but wait. Wait what will they decide. But pain and tears never stop. It’s bitter cold loneliness. I simply hold onto my promise to be with her. I will wait, no matter how ill I get in age when I would finally be with her. She is only reason for me to keep living and not doing suicide. I simply am so afraid to lose her.

 My father has been an alcoholic for 6+ years, since I was 11 years old. He drinks at home by himself most nights and is sometimes still drunk when I leave for school the next morning. Even when he’s sober my dad is belligerent, angry, and verbally abusive. Alcohol has taken its toll on his health (he has Type 2 diabetes) and liver function, but my dad is completely in denial. His insults and controlling behavior have turned my mother into an insecure, anxious shell of her former self. They have a hateful marriage of 25 years, and I can’t remember a time before their late-night screaming matches.<|im_end|>

 I’m so very sorry that you, your sister and your mom are living in such an unpredictable and hostile home. Alcoholism rarely is solely the problem of the alcoholic. As you so clearly pointed out, it takes its toll on everyone in the family. If you haven’t already, please look into whether there is a chapter of Al-Anon or Alateen in your community. These organizations provide important support and information to family members of alcoholics. I think you would find it helpful to go to a few meetings to see what they have to offer.To make it through the year, I can only suggest that you and your sister spend as much time out of the house as possible. Keep your grades up and build your resume so you can get into a good college. Get involved with after-school activities. Volunteer at something you find meaningful. Take on a part-time job. Do homework at school or at your local library. Above all, be a loyal friend to your friends. You need people to hang out with so that you can give and receive the emotional support that good friends offer.If you can, see if your mom will take you and your sister on some trips this summer to visit colleges you think you might want to attend. Then be sure to see your school counselor right away in the fall to start working on applications. There are many, many good scholarships out there but it takes time to do the research to find them and to apply.An active and meaningful life with friends and at school will help you manage the stress at home. Sadly, you can’t change your dad. (Hopefully at some point he’ll want to change himself.) But what all three of you (you, your sis, and your mom) can do is build a good future for yourselves.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 You are a man in anguish. That does not make you psychotic. I wish there was something I could say to help you stop worrying about what everyone else thinks and start taking care of yourself.Twin relationships can be joyful but they also can be terribly complicated, especially when the personalities are more different than appearances. Sometimes twins unconsciously develop opposite ways of being in the world just to have their own identities. It’s the obvious solution. It certainly makes the point that the two people are different. But sometimes people take it too far. They don’t do this on purpose. It just happens. There are more subtle and more satisfying ways to be your own self than to be a mirror image of your brother. I think you need help finding them.The way out of this is to see a therapist. I hope you can reconsider it. Yes, we therapists do see people with significant mental illness. But we also see people who are the “worried well” — people who are not mentally ill but who are troubled and who need the objective eyes and the information and support we can offer. You fit into that group. I am concerned that if you continue to withdraw and spin around and around in the same tortured thoughts, you will become ever more depressed. You need someone to help you break through the spin and start you on a path toward healthy self-discovery.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

As a child I was sexually abused for 4 years. No one knows. The only reason it stopped was because he died. Whilst that ended by the time I was 11 I still think about it and get upset. Lately however some feelings have developed that scare me. My family is very traditional. We all sit and have dinner in silence, father is the head of the household, and I am expected to be a sort of stepford daughter. I get straight A’s, don’t date boys (mostly because I am rarely allowed out of the house), hold a part time job, don’t drink, smoke or do drugs and I don’t so much as ask them to drive me places or give me money. I don’t treat them with disrespect but I constantly feel as if they believe I am a bad daughter. I think they are disappointed no matter how much I try and they don’t understand anything about me.<|im_end|>

Lately I have found myself to be wanting to kill people at night. I don’t feel like this in the day but as soon as the sun sets, sure enough, I get an urge to kill someone. I don’t feel like I need to kill myself although I have already had suicidal thoughts. I start plotting ways to kill people and planning things like this in detail. I also have started reading crime novels and books to do with death. I told my friend about this and she recommended I find help. It scares me to think that i’m only 13 and I am having these types of dark thoughts. I’m not sure what to do about this, but if you could help, that would be great. Thanks.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Homicidal and suicidal thoughts are two sides of the same coin — both stemming from deep emotional suffering and an inability to deal with this emotional pain. They signify unhappiness, someone who feels as if their life isn’t going well.Avoid reading crime novels or books that deal with death. Indulging your morbid interests reinforces your negative state of mind. It’s akin to adding fuel to a fire. Reading is not a cure for mental health issues but if you’re going to read, choose materials that will improve your state of mind. Read about kindness, love and patience, those sorts of things. They are healthy and positive.Your friend’s recommendation for seeking help was a good one. You should ask your parents to take you to a mental health professional. A mental health professional will talk to you about what’s wrong and teach you how to deal with these urges. Therapy will transform your unhealthy urges into healthy urges. You can learn to deal with your emotional pain in a way that is productive and advantageous.It’s important to recognize that many people, teenagers especially, felt the way you do now but with help, their lives improved. Mental health professionals want to help you. All you have to do is ask. Don’t hesitate to call 911 or go to the emergency room if you feel that you might harm yourself or someone else. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I’ve had depression for a very very long time but lately it has escalated. I’ve been suicidal for quite a while but now my thoughts aren’t my own. they’re like a separate voice in my head. instead of my own thinking it’s a whole other voice I can’t control. it says the only way it will go away is if I’m hurting myself. I have been clean for a month so I don’t want to but it’s not even my own thought. I don’t know if this is a sign of early schizophrenia or not.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You mentioned hearing a voice that is not your own. I wonder how you know it is not your voice. Voices fall under the category of hallucinations. Hallucinations are symptoms of psychotic disorders, one of which is schizophrenia. Hallucinations may also be the result of drug use or interactions, disorders such as epilepsy and other organic brain conditions. I cannot determine over the Internet if you have schizophrenia or any other mental health disorder.When you believe that something may be wrong, then you should seek help. Thoughts of suicide are especially concerning and need to be taken seriously. Thus, it’s imperative that you contact a mental health professional for an evaluation.Ask your parents to take you to a mental health professional. Another option is to contact the school guidance counselor. They will be able to help you. If you feel like you might harm yourself or someone else, go to the emergency room or call 911. They will be able to keep you safe and in touch with people who can help.Your symptoms are highly treatable. Mental health professionals are trained to deal with every problem that you have described. It will not shock them and they will know how to respond. Medication and psychotherapy are good treatments that will provide a great deal of relief. I hope you get to experience treatment so you can see for yourself how much better you will feel. Treatment works. Please ask for it. Good luck.<|im_end|>"

Hi. I just need to get this clear. My soon to be ex has seen the same psychiatrist for 25 years. He has an ongoing Rx for Xanax but does not take it frequently except in times of stress. He is a moderate drinker. He has had trouble holding a job and blames me for almost everything. I have grown unwilling to put up with this. I grew up with an alcoholic mother and have recently started attending Al Anon. His blaming behavior seems so much like hers. Do you think he might be addicted or dependent? Don’t you think 25 years seeing the same shrink without massive improvement seems off? Any suggestions other than keeping calm and doing what I need to do to protect myself?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Your questions are difficult to answer because I don’t have many details about your situation. Generally speaking, if there is no improvement in a mental health condition over a 25-year period, then it is a problem. One would expect to experience significant improvement over that period of time.With regard to Xanax, the fact that your soon-to-be-ex uses it on an “as needed” basis suggests that he is not addicted. He may be dependent on the medication in that he knows he has access to it in an emergency situation and this provides a sense of comfort. His drinking is a concern, especially if there are occasions in which he consumes alcohol while under the influence of Xanax.It is good that you are attending Al-Alon. You can learn a great deal from members of those groups.You asked the question: what else can I do that I am not already doing? There may be little else that you can do. He will soon be your ex-partner. My presumption is that he will no longer be a major part of your life. That may be a desirable outcome, especially if you are no longer willing to tolerate his blaming you.If you plan to continue having regular contact with him, then it would be advantageous to set boundaries regarding your level of interaction. For example, you could set a rule that you will not have contact with him if he is drinking. You could also make a rule that if he wants to be part of your life, then he must attend therapy in addition to seeing a psychiatrist. Your fellow Al-Alon group members might have additional suggestions for you. I wish you the best. Don’t hesitate to write again. Take care.<|im_end|>"

Hello. My girlfriend has 2 boys ages 5 and 4. The 4-year-old is in a very big power struggle with her. He is urinating all over the house, shouts at her, and routinely disobeys. He can be physical at times with his brother and mother and me. She has tried spanking, praise, and rewards. But nothing seems to do the complete trick and he falls back into these cycles where he is super bad.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m very glad you took the time to write. This little boy is highly distressed. The fact that he does well at school and with sitters suggests that the problem is with his relationships with his family members, not a mental illness.Although you’ve tried many types of discipline, I’m afraid that may be part of the problem. Inconsistent methods of discipline confuse kids. They don’t know what the rules really are. Often they then push the limits until the adults have finally had it. By then, the child has gone way too far and the adults end up doing and saying things they regret. Then things tend to simmer down for awhile — until the next blow up.There is more going on here than I can address in a letter. Ideally, you and both of the boys’ parents should go together to a family therapist/parent educator. Yes, together. I hope the three of you can put the child’s needs ahead of whatever tensions may exist among you. Someone needs to take a look at the whole picture to see what is driving this kid to such extremes when he is at home. Often things the adults in a child’s life think are not all that important loom large for a child. By talking to all three parental figures, a family therapist may be able to tease out the dynamics that are reinforcing the bad behavior.The fact that this little boy does well in other situations is a very, very hopeful sign but it won’t last forever. Please don’t wait another week or month to get the help you need to address his problem — both for his sake and for everyone else’s.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Now, I feel as if I don’t need any of those things nor do I want them.<|im_end|>

 I would like to know more about you and your life circumstances. You are expressing a general dissatisfaction with life. You mention a lack of energy. You mention a lack of motivation. You mention no longer trusting people’s intentions. All of this can point to and can be consistent with depression. Of course, there could be many other causes and I would need the ability to question you and evaluate you in a clinical setting.Age is a factor. Are you an older person who has simply resigned herself to the reality of life and the time limits of life? Are you a teenager, who is overwhelmed and afraid of all the anxiety the future may hold?Do you have other emotional issues that have preceded your current feelings? Have you recently gone through a life trauma?Are you taking any legal or illegal drugs? Are you taking steroids or hormone supplements? Are you using marijuana, whose principal side effect is a reduction in motivation?How is your physical health?How long has this been going on?There are many, many questions that need to be answered. If you continue to feel this way, then you should seek the source of those feelings. No, it is not normal to feel the way you do. Most people do not feel as you do and by any definition of normal (cultural, statistical or theory-based), your feelings are not desirable or adaptive.You should not simply accept those feelings. Not all feelings are legitimate. Even the terribly strong feelings of phobias are not legitimate. Agoraphobics, who are terrified to leave their home, experience severe overwhelming panic and fear. Their fear is not legitimate. Their feelings are too extreme for the actual danger that exists beyond their front door. Basically, we all face the same dangers in the world beyond our home and the level of fear and anxiety that we feel could be described as normal. It is much less intense than the agoraphobics and is roughly appropriate for the real dangers that exist out in the world.Your feelings are not automatically correct. They may not be realistic. It would be a mistake for anyone to assume that their feelings are valid. They may be appropriate to your circumstances but they may be as invalid as those of the agoraphobic who is overwhelmed by the fear of what exists beyond his front door.I would suggest you speak to a therapist to get an objective and professional opinion. Please take care and I wish you the best of luck.<|im_end|>"

Let me first start by saying, I have not lost anything. I am not in a stage of depression that is causing me to lose interest in things. I am a very motivated individual who works hard, eats healthily and exercises all the time. Thus I do do things and put a lot of effort in to these things. However, i don’t know why i do them, i know it’s the right thing to do and it is important for health etc but i don’t really care about it all. I never have truly “wanted” anything ever. Never had a burning desire or loved anything. I have always had issues with emotional attachment and lack any form of emotional connection with any thing. I have had long term relationships but never loved someone. I don’t care if someone dies. I feel like i am just floating through life not bothered about anything, just living an empty life. Never happy, never sad. Just existing. (From England)<|im_end|>

 What is curious about your email is that it isn’t presented so much as a question as it is a statement. You’re saying you are dissatisfied — particularly in the last sentence — where you say that you are empty. You describe yourself as being motivated, not attached to outcomes, and detached. These are not universally negative things, but I’m assuming there is a question about how to change these experiences because of the emptiness.The work is to find moments when you are feeling something other than what you describe. A moment of engagement, or receiving someone’s kindness, a loving act toward you, receiving pleasure, accepting a gift, even tasting good food. The idea is to find those moments that are different from what you normally interpret as “empty”. The work is in finding some fragments that are not simply when you are existing. Look for natural times when something different — something better — has happened. Noticing the differences and savoring them will allow them to be highlighted.It is easier to amplify something that is present than to create a reaction from scratch. The more you are able to notice and amplify the differences the more engagement and connection to your life you will feel.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

When I was 15 years old (I am 30 today) I sat on the edge of the 16th floor window seriously considering to jump because I couldn’t handle what my father kept saying about me not achieving the scores he wanted me to score in high school. The 2 only things that stopped me were my religion, I am a Muslim, and in Islam; taking your own life will send you to hell fire. The second factor is I was worried about my mother, she is too sensitive and I was almost certain she wouldn’t be able to handle and live with such an action.<|im_end|>

 Thank you for the detailed explanation. There is a lot here and it sounds as if there are some unresolved feelings and issues with your father. My encouragement is to try some individual therapy. Talking about this with someone who is trained to listen can be very helpful in sorting it through. I understand your faith is deep and I believe the help of a therapist will give you a perspective that is beneficial.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I am a 22 year old recent graduate and my fiance is 30 years old and a hard worker as a business analyst. We started dating when I was 18 (he was 26). We dated through my years at school, he broke up with me shortly twice in our earlier time together (my family was not very accepting of me dating and he saw that). Later when I moved to Dallas for the last two years of nursing school, we decided to move in together.<|im_end|>

 Sometimes when we ask a question, we already have the answer. I don’t think your ambivalence about getting married is a case of having cold feet. I think you’ve made a reasonable assessment of your own situation.Often people who started dating when they were in high school just kind of slide into marriage. They and the people around them just seem to think it’s the next logical step in the relationship. Sometimes it works out fine. But sometimes it is at the cost of finding out who they are as individuals and discovering what (and who) they want in life. It’s not at all uncommon to find that the person they chose at 15 or 17 isn’t necessarily the kind of person they would choose as an adult. This realization is often painful for everyone concerned.In your case, your fiance is enough older than you are that he probably did have the time to come into himself before he met you. You on the other hand, were in a different developmental stage. Having denied yourself experiences that are common during the college years, you now find yourself on the brink of making a lifelong commitment to someone else when you aren’t really sure who you are.It’s not my place to tell you what to do. Only you can search your heart and mind and decide what is best for both of you. But I will venture that it is not fair to a future partner (or to yourself) to launch into marriage with significant doubts.I wish you well, <|im_end|>"

 This guy may be wonderful, but he probably isn’t the guy for you. If you interested him, he would not have ignored you. Texting him drunk probably pushed him even further away. What you need to do is give this up.I suspect that obsessing about this guy serves a purpose. Maybe you are nervous about meeting men and this fantasy helps you avoid the task. Or maybe your self-esteem is suffering and you don’t think you have what it takes to attract someone who is equally attracted to you. Or it might be something else.Please try to figure out what problem thinking about this man helps you solve. If you can’t do it on your own, please make an appointment with a therapist to help you get over the relationship-that-isn’t so you can make a real one.You deserve to be loved by someone who will love you generously and sweetly and without games.

I am a fourteen year old female who lives with a single father and a younger ten year old brother. My father has been evaluated psychologically and has protracted identity issues, adjustment difficulties, and it takes him longer than most to comprehend things. He is fifty six years old and is still trying to find himself in the same sense as an adolescent boy.<|im_end|>

I understand why your dad’s behavior makes you uncomfortable. From what you said, your dad doesn’t seem to have good enough boundaries. Hugging, tickling, and staring at his adolescent daughter is simply not appropriate. Since there isn’t another adult in the house, it looks like it falls to you to tell him so. This doesn’t need to be a big confrontation. Just gently tell him that you are too big now for body hugs and tickle games. If he protests or tells you you are misinterpreting things, simply tell him that it may be harmless to him but it makes you too uncomfortable.Although you seem to be handling your dad’s limitations pretty well, it could get more complicated. If this doesn’t stop, you’re going to need someone to back you up. Another issue is that your little brother may not be getting an appropriate model for how an adult male manages his sexuality. I hope you will think hard about whether there is an adult you can take into your confidence. Maybe you can get closer to a relative or your school guidance counselor or the mom of one of your friends. You shouldn’t have to deal with this alone.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I seriously dislike my stepdaughter. She is now 13 and is the youngest of 4 kids, but from a different father. My wife described the circumstances of her birth as an accident, as she didn’t even have a relationship with the girl’s father. She did consider abortion at the time, but followed through with the pregnancy. The girl has always had everything handed to her, and my wife seems to feel guilty, although she tells me, and I see, her trying to educate the girl. The girl is impossible! She is selfish and is incapable of thinking about someone other than herself. Even when she is nice, she is unbearable. I try to participate in her life as much as I can; to try to find activities we can do to get closer, but it seems she doesn’t like me either. There is nothing about her that I like. My wife also seems annoyed by her. She is a good student, though, and has friends. Teachers speak well of her too. She is lazy and believes she is so smart. She is smart, but she just thinks so highly of herself. As much as I try to understand the situation, consider the girl’s past, and to try participate and help my wife, and cannot like this girl. I do believe she is old enough to take responsibility of what she does wrong and to do her part in helping us become a family. I am afraid I will not make it, regardless of how much I love my wife. I do realize that my attitude lately does reflect the fact that I dislike the girl, and I try to not make it as conspicuous for my wife; but it can be pretty obvious, especially when my wife is also annoyed by the girl. My wife works a lot, and the girl spends a lot of time by herself, as she has always have. I’ve suggested that we find activities, but the girl doesn’t want to do anything other than being on her phone and ask for new stuff, which she ends up breaking anyway. She has no regard for other people’s space or things; everything is disposable to her. I feel like I won’t make for another 4-5 years… Please help!<|im_end|>

I’m afraid there may not be an easy solution to this problem. You chose to marry your wife knowing her situation. You picked this family. Choices have consequences.You can try talking to your wife about parenting. Parenting classes could help. Both of you can try reading books about tough love. Even then, it may not be enough to change the family dynamic or how you feel about your stepdaughter, but it is still worth trying.Unless you choose to leave the family, then you must find a way to tolerate your stepdaughter. Eventually, this problem will likely fix itself after she moves out. Understandably, it may be difficult to endure but consider this: you’ve already done it for over a decade. A few more years may be doable.Consider meeting with a therapist for a deeper analysis. They might have ideas to assist.I wish I had a better answer for you but the reality is, not all problems can be fixed. Some problems require patience, tolerance and endurance. This sounds like one of those times. Thanks for your question.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: Me and my boyfriend have been dating two and a half years and in December 2013 I gave birth to our little boy. A week after having my son I got postportum depression and did something horrible. My ex boyfriend wrote my mom and said he had missed me so I wrote him on my facebook and told him I loved him and missed him and my boyfriend went on my facebook and saw the messages.<|im_end|>

 This isn’t just your problem. It’s a couple problem. You made a mistake. You’ve apologized and you feel terrible about it. You’ve done what you can. Your boyfriend now has to decide if he is going to give you the gift of trust. Yes, a gift. At some point, words of forgiveness have to become action. You apologize. He forgives and renews his trust. You make sure not to betray that trust again.Meanwhile, he has his own apologizing to do. His mother had no right to make the decision about how you feed your son. If she was concerned, she should have helped you adjust to breast feeding rather than taking action. However, she didn’t “ruin your bonding experience.” You and your boyfriend did. You gave in for the sake of convenience. Your boyfriend didn’t back you up and encourage you to resume breastfeeding. (By the way: Mothers of bottle-fed babies also bond with their babies just fine. Just spend lots of time cuddling.)You two are a parenting team now. Your boyfriend’s first loyalty should be with you. He needs to apologize. You need to decide if you are going to give him the gift of trusting him to be your parenting partner. He needs to make sure not to betray that trust again.Meanwhile. What do you mean you have no help with the baby? Real men change diapers, give baths and play with their children. You both made this baby. You both need to be parenting him.Mutual support with other parents is very important at this stage of your life. If the two of you start taking your baby for long walks at a local park, chances are that you’ll start seeing other young parents. There’s nothing quite like a friendship with someone who has a child the same age. Say hello. Admire the babies. Take it from there. You might also ask your pediatrician if there is a parent support group in your area. Take looking for new friends as seriously as you would look for a job or a partner if you didn’t have one. You deserve the mutual support and sharing that other parents of babies can provide.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Our son is 27 years old. He has had a rocky childhood and adult life. As a child he had problems getting along with others and was often in trouble at school although he has always done well academically. At the age of about 8 years, a psychiatrist suggested that he had Asperger’s. At the time, I didn’t think this was a correct diagnosis. However, after years of crisis after crisis, I am beginning to think otherwise. Since finishing high school, he has moved in and out of our home several times. At one point he was a heavy user of marijuana and perhaps some other drugs and became psychotic. He has problems getting along with others when working, has gone from job to job (mostly in the service industry), and I think it’s because of his Asperger’s. He is not good with money. When he moves back home with us, he is irritable and angry and takes things the wrong way. He is not totally aware of the feelings of other family members. He just broke the lease for his apartment because he was having problems with the people living above him making noise. He is going to college and he was unable to do his studies. Because of this he has temporarily moved back home once again. He is very knowledgeable about computers and hopes to one day start his own business. He refuses to go for any professional help and thinks the problems are the fault of others. We are at a loss as to what to do to help him. Any suggestions? Thank you. (age 63, from Canada)<|im_end|>

 I’m sorry that you have had such difficulties with your son and that he has struggled throughout his life. There is certainly a chance that he could be on the autism spectrum, but the only way to know for sure is for him to go through a psychological evaluation. This could also open a lot of doors for him in terms of getting help with education and employment. Even if the problem is not Asperger’s, it sounds like his struggles are genuine and he needs help.It is difficult setting firm boundaries with an adult child who should be living independently but isn’t. However, clear boundaries and expectations need to be in place. Ultimately the agreement needs to be that he can live with you until he can get back on his feet — only if he gets professional help. If he does re-enroll in college, the student counseling center and department for disabilities would be great resources to tap into. If that’s not a possibility right now, the local community mental health center may be the best place to seek services. Unfortunately, the way you describe his history he is unlikely to be successful, even with his intelligence, unless he gets help. I hope that you find a way to facilitate this process and in the meantime prepare yourself for the possibility of more bumps in the road.All the best,<|im_end|>"

  According to your letter, she is physically and verbally aggressive. She only wants to go out when it’s convenient for her. She doesn’t seem to care much for your needs and isn’t bothered by attacking people. You have described someone who is abusive. Whether or not she is sociopathic is difficult to determine without more information.You mentioned that people like her are attracted to you. It may be that these kinds of people see you as an easy target, someone easy to abuse. I would need more information to know if that is true. If you continually find yourself around these types of people, the way you behave might be attracting them. Consider consulting a therapist to examine this issues in more depth. A therapist would be able to determine what part you play, if any, in attracting these types of people and how to have healthy relationships.Choose wisely with whom you spend your time. Don’t allow people to abuse you and treat you badly. You asked the question: why am I attracted to sociopathic people? The better question is: Why would you allow yourself to be abused by sociopathic people?Counseling can help you know what a healthy relationship should be like and how to stop abusive people from coming into your life.

 In the last three years I’ve been in therapy with two different psychologists for social anxiety. The fact is, I’ve noticed something’s wrong with me. I believe I may have BPD, because I’ve always had many problems with abandonment, instability of relationships and mood swings, and I also meet all the symptoms of the disorder(even substance abuse and self harm).I’ve always had a confuse sense of identity,I’ve never really known who I was, and experienced dissociation and depersonalisation since the age of 11. I identify as nonbinary even though I was born female, but I know this could be a consequence of BPD.My therapist doesn’t know about my condition because she just keeps asking me only about my anxiety and everytime I try to tell her something of the above she seems to not be even listening to me. I’m writing this because recently something changed.I’ve always had very different personalities depending from who I was with, but it’s been a while since I started losing connection with reality and I can’t tell what’s real anymore.I have nightmares and most of the days I don’t know if what I experience is real or not.I see the younger me as a weak, pathetic girl who knew nothing about anything but I don’t even remember how she was or what she liked. There’s this other part of me, though, called Chrissie. She’s a childish girl who is always cheerful and behave like a psycho,I can sense her voice in my head(not like an hallucynation, just an inner voice different from mine – sometimes we have conversations)that always suggests me to do impulsive things like beating the ones who treat me badly or saying mean things.There are days when something happens and I start to feel anxious, so she takes control and I start to act so differently that the people around me ask me if I’m high or something. Since Chrissie appeared I made some researches and learnt about DID. I’m very unsure about the amnesia that should incurr though, because I happen to be co-present when she takes control, but she does what she wants and I later feel like someone else has controlled my body even though I know what happened.When I dissociate while I’m writing something I can’t remember later what I was writing before, and I noticed I have very few memories of my life before my 14th birthday, but nothing more than this.<|im_end|>

 DID is a possibility, but that determination can only be made by an in-person evaluation, conducted by a mental health professional. Perhaps you’ve tried to discuss this with your therapist, but you didn’t communicate your concerns effectively.Alternatively, you may have been communicating effectively but your therapist didn’t think you had DID or did not know how to treat it. In any event, your concerns should be discussed more explicitly with your treating therapist. It is important to have clarity about your treatment goals. One possible strategy is to show this letter to your therapist. It might provide a fuller explanation of your symptoms.DID can be difficult to both diagnose and treat. Some therapists are not familiar with DID because it is so rare. Others are not comfortable treating it and may refer you to a specialist. Generally speaking, if you have experienced positive changes in your life, as a result of therapy and you are feeling an overall sense of positivity and happiness, then you are likely receiving good therapeutic help.

So I’m a 25 year old male, recently in the last 2 years I’ve started to experience some odd sexual desires. It first started that I enjoyed masturbating on video chat for anyone who wanted to watch either men or women. After a few months I started to enjoy watching men masturbate to me masturbating, something about it would absolutely turn me on like crazy. Now as time has passed I find myself curious to find a masturbating friend, but I am not attracted to men. Like the thought of me and another man just pleasuring each other with our hands turns me on but I just don’t get turned on by man. I love women inside and out from head to toe. Any idea what I’m going thru? Could it be a phase or just a random fantasy? Please help and thanks!<|im_end|>

  Thank you for reaching out. It sounds like you are currently in an exploratory phase, sexually speaking. It is not uncommon for individuals to go through a period of exploration where they discover what they are attracted to, what they are not attracted to, what turns them on and so on.  There is currently a hot debate about the idea of sexual fluidity. As someone who does a lot of work with individuals and couples exploring their sexuality, I would recommend that you continue to explore. As long as you are engaging in consensual sexual acts and no one is getting hurt, there is nothing wrong with exploring your fantasies further. Throughout this process you will get more clarity in terms of where you stand with both your sexual identity and orientation. It is possible that it could be a phase or a particular fantasy; however, you will only know for certain after further exploration.<|im_end|>"

However if she had a discussion with me that greatly concerns me. Her favorite band is playing in Chicago, states away and she immediately bought plane and concert tickets for her and me so she could go see them. However she is obsessed with the leader of the band. She says that he is the exact same guy that she has seen in her dreams as a love interest before she even knew this guy existed in real life. She is taking this trip to Chicago just to meet this guy. She says that according to his personal details she thinks they would have a soul connection and that if they were in a relationship it would be intense and he would understand her more than her current husband. She is convinced her dreams mean she needs to be with this guy and that if she goes to Chicago he will want to be in a relationship with her.<|im_end|>

 I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of only a letter, of course. But what you are describing is consistent with a diagnosis of erotomania. This is a psychotic disorder where a person truly believes that a (usually famous or high status) stranger is a love interest. Since this occurred when your friend got pregnant, I have to wonder if something either medical or psychological was triggered by the pregnancy.You probably can’t help her with this. Her husband, however, may be able to. Do share this information with him. She needs help, not a “break” from the marriage. I hope he’ll be able to get her to a psychiatrist for an evaluation. Her health, the marriage, and the baby’s health depend on it.I wish you well, <|im_end|>"

Okay, so I have been having an issue where I have the strong urge to kill people. I haven’t had any bad relationships with family or other people. I just want to kill people for the fun of it. One of my most recent episodes of a very strong urge to kill was actually a few hours before I started to write this. I was in the kitchen helping my mother cook dinner. Then, all of a sudden I got this very strong urge to kill everybody in my house. I felt like I was about to do it. Like half of my brain was almost programming itself to kill, and that feeling felt so good that I started to shake and get goosebumps all over my body. On the other hand, my right side of my brain felt like it was saying ‘what are you doing? Stop it NOW!’ Then before I knew it, my hand was almost about to reach out for the knife, but I stopped myself luckily. This kind of thing has happened to me before, and I was very confused about this. Confused and scared. I didn’t know what to do. The only person that I’ve ever told about this was my friend. I needed to get it off of my chest and she was there for me. Also, I don’t feel anything towards other people. I’ve actually dreamt and imagined so many times of killing them with my own hands. I don’t really care for other people at all. I have one friend, and she is my best friend in the whole world. We are inseparable. I also love the feeling of a knife in my hands…. The cool blade running against my tongue as I act out licking my victim’s blood. The handle; black and hard, yet also cool to the touch as it warms in my hand. It’s almost like a fetish to me, and I have to admit, I’ve always been interested in BDSM. It sounded so pleasurable to me. Also to add onto all of this mess, I have always been interested in the Holocaust. I love the way that the Nazis and SS soldiers killed the Jews. I AM NOT SAYING THAT I AM WITH THEIR BELIEFS. I agree that the Jews were innocent people that didn’t deserve anything like that. It’s just that things like the gas chambers, shooting people in the back of the neck, etc. has interested my for as long as I’ve known about the Holocaust. Let me also say that I don’t think anybody will understand me, they will probably just say that I’ve just been going through a phase or it’s a result of having a fetish towards BDSM, but I know it’s not that. These urges get very strong, and when it’s so strong that I almost kill my whole family, I am positive that it’s not a phase or my fetish. It’s something serious, and I have come to realize this. I am very concerned not only for myself but for the people around me. I don’t want anybody getting hurt. While on the other hand, I really want to hurt so many innocent people. Like the Holocaust. Let me also say this; I am a 14 year old girl, who gets straight As in school. I’m not popular or anything, I don’t want to be. I have only 2 or 3 close friends at school, but I only really like 1. She’s my best friend that I could ever have, and I really love her like a sister. I really need someone like this in my life. She helps me gets through tough times, and I’ll help her through anything. Also, is like to say that I am so scared to tell my parents. I don’t want to break their hearts. I don’t know how to bring it up or anything. The friend that I have told this to said that she would help me, but all I said was thank you, and that I could handle it myself, but I lied. I couldn’t tell her the truth. I know that I got her into this by telling her, and I was happy to hear the concern in her voice, but I didn’t want her to go in a downward spiral all because I had told her this. So I started to distance myself away from her little by little. I don’t want to be hurt her. I don’t want her to feel guilty if this gets out of hand. I just want her to be happy, and as far away from me as I could. I know that she is starting to notice, and I know that she is being hurt by this, but I’m so scared. I’m afraid that one day it’ll go too far, and if end up killing somebody that I find very dear to me. I’m so scared. I don’t know what to do. I know I need help, but I’m afraid to tell my parents. In fear of losing them. In dear if them fearing that they are losing their daughter to this madness going on inside if my head. It’s driving me crazy and I want it to stop. Please just help me. I’m begging you with all of my might. Help me before I do anything stupid and am put in death row for torturing somebody or a genocide. Please I’m begging you with all my strength and all of my might. HELP ME. I’d like to end this description with a thank you, and also a please try to help, as I am concerned for not only myself, but for the people around me.<|im_end|>

 Having aggressive feelings is not an uncommon phenomenon. Some studies have shown that the majority of people have had at least one homicidal thought over the course of their lives. These thoughts were elicited when an individual felt powerless, threatened or frustrated with their life circumstances.Despite your fears, it is imperative that you talk to your parents about how you have been feeling. It may not be easy, but you should try. If you think having a face-to-face discussion with them would be too difficult, then write them a letter. They can only help if you make them aware of this situation. If you refuse to tell them, they’ll have no opportunity to help you and thus this problem continues.It’s important that you proactively address this issue. The well-being of others may be at stake. As you noted, your life may be in jeopardy as well. If you were to follow your fantasies, you risk spending your life in prison. Being incarcerated would be an awful way to live. In the abstract, it’s difficult to appreciate just how horrendous losing your freedom would be. I can assure you, you would regret your actions.Murder is a sin. Every religion considers it as such. It is an act of evil. It destroys lives. You should be doing everything within your power to avoid engaging in acts of evil. In this case, the first step to preventing the harm of others is to ask for help from your parents.I worked with many teens who have felt similar feelings. They’re scared to tell anyone about how they feel. They’re often embarrassed. They realized, with therapy, that their feelings were misguided and that there were solutions to their problems. You can expect similar successful and positive results if you were to enter therapy.I hope that my response helps you to recognize the importance of proactively seeking help. If you feel as though you might harm yourself or someone else, call 911 or go to the hospital immediately. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From an adult woman in the U.S.: I have weight and depression issues related to several traumatic events in my life (accidental death of father many years ago, recent violent death of mother, emotional abuse in former marriage). I also have a stressful job that I don’t love. I’ve been further traumatized by the current political situation in our country, I am very political.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
You have been through a lot of very painful experiences. I’m glad you are seeking help. You deserve it.Religious therapy is not the only option. There are many schools of therapy that can be helpful. You do need to talk to someone who has experience in both trauma and eating disorders. It is not an unusual combination so I’m confident that there is excellent help available for you. I suggest you talk with your doctor for a referral. You can also click on the “Find Help” tab on our homepage. You can search a directory of therapists who work in your area.I do suggest that you interview a few therapists to find the person who is the right “fit” for you. Research has repeatedly shown that the most important variable for success in therapy is whether the therapist and client click. So if the first therapist you see doesn’t seem to understand you, do give yourself the gift of looking further. It is worth the time in the beginning to look for someone you feel can offer you the support and practical help you need and deserve.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

First of all, I’d like to apologize in advance if this isn’t as coherent as you’d like; my thoughts have the tendency to be a bit disorganized. Please don’t hate me. I just turned 20 and I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia and Major Depression when I was 17. I was later diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Mania. I’m really sad all the time. I’ve taken lots of different kinds of medication but they don’t work at all (except for Xanax). One of the problems I’ve been having is that I don’t seem to react to situations the way people around me do. I’m hypersensitive about what people think about me. Sometimes I get really upset about great things. I recently met a great girl and we got along really well so I started crying and tried to kill myself. Other times, people will hurt me and do really bad things to me, and it makes me laugh. If I get too excited about something like a new job, a trip to somewhere fun or even just a really good song, it makes me want to die. But at the same time I’m happy… Sometimes I think about hurting people I care about to show them how much I love them. When my friends do nice things for me, I want to stab them and hold them in my arms but I know that’s not polite. I avoid certain social situations like parties because I fear my excitement may cause me to become suicidal. It’s all really confusing. Is there anything I can do to be more like normal people? I want to be a good person; I don’t want to be evil.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Your reactions to the situations you have described are unusual. I’m wondering if you’re misinterpreting these situations or your symptoms. Because you contemplate suicide and have a desire to hurt others, you should be evaluated by a mental health professional.A mental health evaluation could provide an objective assessment of what might be wrong. It would also determine the best treatment to address your symptoms.The right medication could help but it seems as though you have yet to find a medicine that works for you. Keep trying. It can take a while to find the right medication but, once you do, it could eliminate these symptoms from your life.Medication could help, but don’t overlook counseling. Counseling directly deals with the emotional aspects of psychological problems. Counseling could help to better define your problems and to help you better understand your feelings.You are aware that your reactions are inappropriate but what’s less clear is how well you are able to control your behavior. If you feel as though you might hurt yourself or someone else, it’s imperative to call for emergency assistance. In the meantime, begin counseling. It might be the missing element in your treatment. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Hi, for awhile I’ve been thinking I have a stress or anxiety disorder but I’m not able to see a therapist or counselor. I often become stressed or anxious easily about things I can’t control also small inconveniences or events make me very upset. I’ve been noticing I don’t sleep well and I’m often tired, I find it hard to focus on anything for a long period of time and almost everything in my life causes me to become stressed or anxious. Since I’m a minor and my parent doesn’t think I have any mental health problems I haven’t been able to see a therapist. I’m not sure what to do in this situation and I feel my mental health isn’t getting any better.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
You said that your parents don’t think there’s anything wrong. Have you told them the extent to which you are suffering? If not, you should. You might try writing them a long letter about how you feel. You should also tell them that you wrote to us at Psych Central. That might help them understand that you are serious about wanting help.If they still are not reacting, then speak to the school guidance counselor, a trusted faculty member or an adult member of your family about this matter. Perhaps they then could speak to your parents. It might be a good strategy for getting your parents to take action.Give the strategies a try. Hopefully, they will work. If you continue to struggle, contact the local children, youth and services organization in your community. Every community has these services. They will ensure that you receive the help that you desire. Good luck and please take care.<|im_end|>"

Hello, I am concerned about my health. I feel like I have a superiority complex and that I am above people which can seem odd or laughable in conversations. I have not been diagnosed, however I feel I may have a personality disorder and some mild psychosis.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You seem to have a strong desire for attention. Generally speaking, people want to be noticed and they want to feel important. Sometimes that need is greater among people who didn’t sufficiently feel loved or valued by their primary caregivers. Perhaps that was lacking in your development and you behave in this manner in order to compensate for those unmet needs. There might be other explanations.The best way to determine what might be wrong and how to correct it is to be evaluated by a mental health professional. An evaluation will determine what treatment would be the most appropriate for your set of symptoms.You are attempting to connect with others but in a seemingly maladaptive way. A good example of this is your desiring the attention of someone who physically harmed you and who wanted nothing to do with you. You should not be accepting of that type of treatment from others. You should avoid unhealthy relationships but because of your strong desire for attention, you seem to be willing to tolerate them. Therapy can be helpful in teaching you how to appropriately interact with others and how to recognize signs of an unhealthy relationship. Learning these skills can significantly improve your relationships and your quality of life. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From a young man in the U.S.: I’ve been working at a nursing home for past 2 years, I’ve had this “thing” where I shut off my emotions and have a cold, icy stare. Well everything was great until we got new workers in our department, that’s when things started getting worse.<|im_end|>

Let’s see: You are willing to physically assault your coworkers and go to jail but you’re not willing to report to HR? I do understand how strongly you feel about the situation, but you aren’t making any sense. The price you would pay for getting even by hurting these people is much too high.You and your fiancee are in a hostile work environment. There are laws and company policies intended to protect workers like yourself. Human Resource departments are generally bound by rules of confidentiality.Do yourself and your fiancee a big, big favor and resist the impulse to get physical and take the problem through proper channels. If you don’t get a satisfactory response, consider getting a different job. Adjusting to a different job is preferable to adjusting to prison!I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hey I am 22, gay black and very anxious. I am in a long distance relationship. I am very jealous and insecure I have issues with accusing my boyfriend of cheating I want to trust him and I have been recently but I believe I feel like he needs to prove his loyalty first which is why I am so anxious and afraid. He is out and about and I feel like there is a burning when I look on his fb and see something to suspicious he says he loves me and only me but I can’t believe him. I am very emotional and clingy and he is stone cold seemingly and overly logical which makes me feel like r doesn’t really love me because when I want his comfort he just gives me some cold fact than make me feel reassured. He has something that he has gone through because he told me he can’t love me the way that would be to me much better than what I am getting now. But he will not open up. I don’t want to lose him and he is coming to see me…I am not sure now because we just had another issue most of out issue…my issues center around social media and I hate that about myself. I don’t like that he like pictures of semi naked which makes me feel ugly and unwanted because I don’t look like that and I hate when his friends text or comment thing because I don’t know them and their past with him. He cheated before and I have had a hard time trusting him since that but before that I was accusing him so I feel like I pushed him to it. Please help me I cannot live without this man and I love him with my heart. I am truly in love with him and I want us to work. I don’t want to push him away. I don’t want to hurt him. I don’t want to lose him am I the problem. What can I do to fix this because want to trust him but it is hard when I have not proof. And all I know about him is from social media and it isn’t like over the top but it is shrouded and that makes me more suspicious of him. Like I hate myself for feeling this way because if he is faithful I am essential pushing away a good man.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 There are several elements of your concern that I think deserve some review. First, this is a long-distance relationship with a man that has cheated on you and has told you he can’t love you the way you need to be loved. In addition, he cannot be vulnerable enough to tell you what causes him to be this way. You are saying you want him to prove his loyalty, but everything about his fidelity, location, and emotional availability suggest you are more drawn to his potential than his truth. I don’t think you are pushing away a good man as much as not seeing who he is.I’d recommend individual therapy to understand more about this. The Find Help tab at the top of this page can help you find someone in your area.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From a teen in Germany: I started to believe I have superpowers to cause deaths, which I strongly believe until now. It’s like I can cause while just being in my room something terrible to happen in other corners of the world (earthquakes, heart attacks, shootings) etc. Then I started to believe I can controle electronics across the globe and someone told me that I really turned off their lights in room, then I tried to test it on other people they said that I can’t turn their lights off, however that one person I still I’m confused if they were lying or not and I’m very convinced they are not and that I have superpowers and it causes me a distress knowing that I indeed caused terrible things using these powers. I also can’t go for a walk, I believe people are being hostile and everyone know who I am.<|im_end|>

 No. You don’t have superpowers. It’s not at all unusual for someone to wish they had them. But it is highly unusual to believe it. The person who told you that you turned off his lights is messing with you.I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of a letter. Beliefs like this can come from an organic problem, a sleep disorder, drug abuse or a mental illness.

I find myself increasingly disillusioned with society and with my peers. In my classes, I feel like there is a lack of focus on important issues and my attempts to provoke conversations on current affairs in the world and how they should be dealt with, specifically in terms of race, domestic policy, and global issues. I feel as if moving on to higher education will not be worth it. I feel if I were to apply myself to some field and envelop myself in my work that it would allow free-loaders to succeed and ride my coattails. I feel as if my peers are rats who lie about their feelings and their interests. They’ll argue that they care very much for social issues such as global minorities facing persecution (the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar, the Sudanese) yet they never say anything about these issues unless prompted by me. Furthermore, those conversations are one-sided and ephemeral because they quickly grow bored discussing issues they don’t care about. Should I continue to pursue personal goals?<|im_end|>

One of the things that stand out from your email is that you seem to be expressing a contradiction. You call your peers boring freeloaders, liars, and rats all the while espousing how deeply you care about how people around the world are being unfairly judged and mistreated. Yes, pursue your goals of higher education. You’ll learn that each of us has different gifts, limitations, and abilities As you have a passion for current affairs dealing with race, domestic policy, and global issues you may want to try to understand your peers rather than judge and dismiss them as unworthy or unable.To quote the Dalai Lama, “We can never obtain peace in the outer world until we make peace with ourselves.”Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: My 13 year old granddaughter has called me today to tell me that she is very unhappy at home and that she has been cutting herself. I asked her if she had told her mom. She said yes the first time she did it two years ago, when she was in 6th grade. She said that she wanted help and to go to a counselor or doctor about it but her Mom never took her. So now she told me that she cut herself again last week. What do i do?? She is very unhappy at home and not feeling good about herself.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 This is a very difficult situation. If you do something independently, your daughter is likely to feel that you have over-stepped or that you may be even siding with her daughter against her. If you do nothing, you will feel like you haven’t given your granddaughter the help she needs. You are caught between your loyalties to both. This is never good.I think the way out of that tricky spot is to talk to your daughter before making any further assumptions or decisions. You’ve always been close so why not try to work as a team to get to the bottom of what is troubling a girl you both love?If you are concerned that your granddaughter will see it as a betrayal, talk to her beforehand. Tell her that it isn’t healthy for you to be trying to solve a problem behind her mother’s back. She asked for your help and you are going to see that her mother pays attention to the issue — which is the real point after all.Then see if your daughter will agree to some family therapy — both to help your granddaughter with the cutting and also to help mother and daughter have a better connection. Your granddaughter is only 13. If they can establish better communication now, she and her mother will be better able to navigate the difficult teen years.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hi! I’m 22 years old and for the past year and a half of my life I have been in a never ending cycle of self-loathing. I think firstly it is important to understand that I’m not the type of person to ask for help. I rarely do even at the most minimal of levels. So it goes without saying that this is, in a way slightly uncomfortable for me. That being said let me address the issue at hand. For the last year and a half I have been experiencing feelings that confuse me. Feelings that until now I have yet to express to any other person, including close friends and relatives. My issue is this, every single and I mean every single thing that I do that is not done to perfection I beat myself up about. I’m not talking about when it happens but in the future. I’ll be watching TV, driving a car, walking down the street and Bam! Out of nowhere a negative thought, embarrassing moment, or otherwise distasteful event will pop in my head. For the next 30 seconds to a minute it will consume me from the inside out. At best I’ll clench my fist or jaw and maybe shake my head. At worst I’ll have to lay down and take deep breaths to overcome it. Whether the event was a lie I told years ago or an awkward encounter I had with a close friend that if I asked they may not even remember. It’s a constant war in my head. On one hand I can realize that 99% of these past events just don’t matter in the bigger picture of life but on the other i’m a perfectionist and they are just unacceptable things that drive me insane. This has lead to strong anxiety to the point that If I’m having a episode in my head I may slur my words while I’m talking to someone. Furthermore it has lead to a hatred for myself and a deep sadness. I have been loved by so many people and can’t explain why I feel the way I do. But the churning in my stomach has to go. It is just to unbearable. Thank you very much for your time.<|im_end|>

 Negative thoughts are a scourge of the human psyche. They are common and can wreak havoc in one’s life. The good news is that they can be corrected with counseling.Part of the problem might be your insistence on perfection. That’s not a standard that anyone can achieve. Humans are imperfect beings. It is a fact of life that perfection is not an achievable goal. People who are expecting perfection will undoubtedly experience disappointment and stress.Researchers have indicated that people who tend toward perfectionism have a strong desire to do something well. That desire is admirable; however, the perfectionist takes things too far. They possess a deep-rooted fear of failing. The fear of making a mistake can be immobilizing. It’s possible that the anxiety and negative thoughts you have described, are directly the result of your desire for perfection.Correcting this problem will involve altering your expectations to be more in line with reality. It will come from your realization that perfection is an unreasonable standard that you must abandon. You can learn new ways of thinking and adapting to life in counseling. Understanding reality and adapting, is the ultimate purpose of counseling.There is no shame in consulting a professional who is trained to help people solve these types of problems. As you have experienced firsthand, thinking affects behavior. If you continue to hold yourself to impossible standards, you will continue to do things that are not in your best interest. You will suffer and nothing will change. Perfectionism is a well-known and understood problem that is easily corrected with counseling.Finally, many people are their own worst enemies when it comes to psychological health. When they have a problem, they will often refuse to seek help because they equate the need to ask for help with personal weakness and failure. This type of thinking prevents many people from seeking treatment and thus they needlessly suffer. Don’t let that be you. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I show a lot of signs of different disorders, but I’m not sure if I actually have one or which one or ones I do have. Within the past few months, I’ve gradually found it much harder to leave my house. It is affecting me to the point where I have to take days off of school because I get physically ill (nauseous) from being around so many people for such a long time. I tend to stay in my room more than anywhere else. I am extremely cautious about talking to other people and it is a very hard thing for me to do. I don’t pick up the telephone no matter what, and I will not call people either. I don’t keep many close friends, and the ones I do have I only see at school or talk to online. I’m terribly afraid of public speaking, working in groups, or being around people in general, and a lot of that is because I’m afraid of what they will think of me. I get very anxious about doing things like going to school, and I have suffered a few minor panic attacks from that. I have extremely low self esteem, maybe even close to self-loathing, and this also prevents me from talking to people I believe. My moods also change very quickly, and are pretty extreme as well.<|im_end|>

 It is always difficult to offer a reliable diagnosis over the Internet. Please keep this in mind. Based on the information you have provided you may have agoraphobia or social phobia. Both are anxiety disorders. Agoraphobia is a fear of being in places where you may not be able to escape. It usually involves a fear of crowds or being with other people in general. Some individuals with severe agoraphobia can no longer leave their homes due to extreme fear. The fear can be crippling. They essentially become prisoners in their own home. You can read more about the characteristics of agoraphobia here.Characteristics of social phobia include having an irrational fear of interacting with people. It also involves a fear of putting yourself in situations which may involve scrutiny or judgments by others. Individuals with social phobia tend to avoid social events because of their intense fear of being judged. You can read more about social phobia by clicking here.Your situation is very concerning. Your anxiety is preventing you from attending school. If you cannot attend school then you risk failing. Social anxiety disorders tend to become progressively worse over time. It is important that you seek help for this issue. Anxiety disorders are very treatable. Many individuals with anxiety disorders are able to overcome them.According to HelpGuide’s website, “When it comes to treating anxiety disorders, research shows that therapy is usually the most effective option. That’s because anxiety therapy—unlike anxiety medication—treats more than just the symptoms of the problem. Therapy can help you uncover the underlying causes of your worries and fears; learn how to relax; look at situations in new, less frightening ways; and develop better coping and problem-solving skills. Therapy gives you the tools to overcome anxiety and teaches you how to use them.”The first step in getting help for social anxiety disorders is often the most difficult because it usually requires physically leaving your home to attend psychotherapy appointments. The prospect of that may be very frightening but it is a necessary step to cure this problem.My advice is this: speak to your parents. Inform them that you possibly have an anxiety disorder. Tell them that you need help and you need it now. As indicated above, anxiety disorders are very treatable but it requires you asking for help. I hope that you are able to get the help you need. Please consider writing back to let me know how you’re doing. I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

<|im_start|>assistant
 If I understand correctly, you don’t want to take medication and you want to know if you should ask for a psych evaluation. Yes, you have the right to ask for a psych evaluation or a second opinion.If you haven’t already done so, inform your prescribing physician that you are no longer taking your medicine. Having all the facts helps him to make informed decisions about your treatment. The more he knows about your case, the better he can help you.He wanted you to take medication to prevent a relapse. Relapse is a legitimate concern. Apparently, you experienced a psychotic episode triggered by stress. Antipsychotic medication can prevent future psychotic episodes.Some people have one psychotic episode and never have another. Others go on to have multiple psychotic episodes. Repeated psychotic episodes are associated with disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. You want to do everything in your power to avoid having another psychotic episode. You might want to reconsider your stance on antipsychotic medication. Even very low doses can protect against future psychotic episodes.If you are unwilling to take medication, then try counseling. Stress has the potential to trigger a psychotic episode. Without treatment of any kind, your risk for relapse increases significantly. Having effective problem-solving and stress-reducing strategies is imperative for your psychological health. Counseling can help you to develop these important skills. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 What you are doing with this man isn’t wrong, but it isn’t likely to solve your problems. When someone is as lonely as you seem to be, they are very vulnerable to interpreting any gesture of kindness as having more meaning than perhaps it does. This man showed some caring and interest and even offered you some advice. That must have felt very, very good. Of course it made you happy. Of course you enjoyed it. But the facts are that you know nothing about him and he isn’t in your life the way a friend would be. Your dependence on hearing from him as your primary source of social contact isn’t healthy or useful. You need more.Analyzing the man’s behavior isn’t really going to help you feel better. Your focus needs to be on finding a group of local friends with whom you can share your life. People do need other people to feel and be at their best.

Ever since I was 16 at least, I’ve heard ongoing music in my head that I think at times other people can hear. I also think I may have schizophrenia due to the fact that I think other people can hear the music. Now that I’m older, lately I’ve been seeing stuff that I thought was crawling like a bug but only for a couple of seconds. Sometimes get into these moods where I get real depressed to the point where I cry. Then sometimes I’ll perk back up. I’m guess I’m somewhat of an introvert and when someone tries to speak to me at times I give them a blank stare or I don’t respond. Are these signs I’m schizophrenic?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I cannot provide or confirm a diagnosis over the Internet, but generally speaking your symptoms do not seem consistent with schizophrenia.You described hearing music in your head. Many people experience having a song “stuck in their head.” They hear a song or catchy jingle on a TV commercial and can’t stop it from repeating over and over in their minds. They are called “earworms.” Researchers estimate that about 90% of people, at least once a week, get a song stuck in their head.You didn’t provide many details about the music you hear, but perhaps the phenomenon of earworms explains what you have been experiencing.You sometimes see bugs crawling. They only last a few seconds. If that experience lasts longer than a few seconds and if it leads to you engaging in self-harm to remove the bugs, then it might indicate psychosis. What you have described is slightly abnormal but not consistent with schizophrenia.You also described feeling depressed. Depression can be a co-occurring symptom of schizophrenia, but it is not a primary symptom of schizophrenia. The depression you are experiencing may indicate a diagnosis of depression or you are reacting to something that is happening in your life. I would need more information about how often you experience depression symptoms to know if a depression diagnosis is warranted.My recommendation is for you to undergo both a physical and mental health evaluation. It’s always best to seek an in-person, thorough evaluation to determine if a disorder is present. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

This is so, so hard. You love your daughter and want to help but she is wearing you out. You know that you and your husband do well as parents since your other two are doing fine. But there’s something about this one. . . You are already doing the kinds of things I would normally suggest for managing an out of control child. So we need to go deeper – or at least somewhere else.I recently read a book called “Raising your Spirited Child” by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka. The author talks about children who are more intense, sensitive, perceptive, persistent, and uncomfortable with change than the average child. She has some excellent ideas about how to make these kids more comfortable and how to cope with the tantrums and blowups when they occur. Why don’t you check it out and see if your daughter fits the description.Another source of help is a child or family therapist. I entered your city into the therapist locator on our homepage and found over 30 profiles of therapists. Make some calls and find a therapist who has experience working with strong-willed little kids. Not everyone has that experience. Someone who does will be able to offer you some practical help as well as some support.I do think it’s important for you to get hold of what is going on before the next baby arrives. As the mother of 4 myself, I know only too well how hard it is to juggle all that we somehow do. You have 6 or 7 months to focus on making things at least a little better before you have to divide your time and attention even further. I hope you and your husband will commit to focusing on doing what you can to strengthen your family now so you can be more relaxed when the baby comes. I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

  The way to understand this is to realize that your concern is enough to have a one-time meeting with a therapist. You obviously are anxious about your reactions and, rather than try to label it one way or another, it may simply be best to talk about the concern.You’ve taken a good first step here, and I would encourage you to take the next step and discuss this with someone. It can only help.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Here’s my story: Married for 12 years with two beautiful children. During their upbringing, the wife and I grew distant of each other. She began to treat me badly with little respect and I began to emotional disconnect with her and stopped providing the emotional loving support that she needs. Looking back – we both were at fault!<|im_end|>

 The core of your relationship is gone, long gone. You can’t trust her. She lies to your face on a daily basis. She has decided that cheating and lying are an acceptable way to improve her life. The cost to you is quite secondary to her desires and imagined needs. There are many wives who are unhappy, feel neglected by their husbands and want much more in their lives. Some of them choose divorce and others choose to cheat. What is the difference between the two? Morality. To many good women, lying and cheating to enhance their lives is unacceptable. They choose divorce when they believe their marriage can not be improved.Counseling can solve great problems in a relationship but counseling will not teach your partner morality. It is wrong to knowingly hurt other people. Lying is wrong and infidelity is wrong; according to every major religious doctrine that I am aware of.You mention that her cheating is “emotional” and perhaps also sexual. She explains to you that emotional cheating is not really cheating. Love is emotion, perhaps the most powerful and meaningful of all emotions. When she turned to another man for her emotional needs, she invalidated the totality of her marriage to you. A marriage is based on love and trust and the most sincere belief that your partner will protect you from pain. Your partner has inflicted pain with a callous regard for your feelings and safety and overall well being.She has purchased her happiness at the cost of your suffering. She plans to leave you and is making plans to do so. Does she care how this will upset your life or hurt you? You ask her to be honest with you. Why, because you would like to be prepared for your future. You would like to minimize the pain that potentially lies ahead. She continues to lie to you so that she will still have you if her affair doesn’t work out or her new man decides he doesn’t want her. You are her insurance.What bothers me the most is her constant lying to you. She has found lying to be a functional part of her life. Dishonesty, cheating, deception are all signs of an unhealthy individual and all of these are certain poison to a relationship. Without trust there is no relationship. It’s time to think about your self. Stop thinking of her needs because she has long ago stopped being concerned about yours. She is not ready to leave you because she has yet to find someone who will accept her. I’m sure you are a convenient baby sitter and help pay the bills. You have proof that she is planning or at least attempting to leave you. Is your relationship over? It has been over for many years, even before her affairs.She is insensitive to your well being. She doesn’t care if she lies or cheats and is anxiously attempting to find your replacement.I can understand that she is unhappy in her marriage. I can understand that she wants more. I would agree that she should have a good strong marriage. I can not accept her belief that these things are accessible through lies and deception. I would say instead that theses things can never be acquired through lies. The only things acquired through deception and cheating is the illusion of that which she seeks.The decision is yours. Good luck.<|im_end|>"

My mom and I are always fighting and i have had enough of it and so has she. She does not listen to me when i’m trying to tell her how i feel and when she does (which is rare) she doesn’t try to help she just tells me why i’m wrong and how disappointed she is with me. It’s always “okay, but…” and i can’t stand it! I am a very opinionated person, which can be annoying, but so is she. I always say what I think is the right thing when we’re fighting but no matter what her way is the only way and if i think it shouldn’t be she screams at me and slaps me! I have tried many times to just talk to her civilly about things but it always leads to a fight. And she never accepts the fact that sometimes she is wrong, even when she is OBVIOUSLY wrong.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It sounds to me like you and your mom are an awful lot alike. You both think the other person ought to be doing something about the situation. She’s stubborn. So are you. I do appreciate how hard you are trying to work things out. And I especially appreciate that you would rather have a good relationship than material things. That speaks well for your character and heart.As you’ve already found out, the strategies you’ve been trying aren’t working. So let me make an alternate suggestion. It’s not new information that your mother gets upset when you try to get her to listen. It’s also not new information that she can’t stand to lose a fight so escalates it instead. The best thing a person can do in that kind of situation is to stop fighting.Do you know that old game of tug of war? People get on either end of a rope and pull. The team that pulls the hardest usually wins. But another way to “win” is to let go. The other team can’t win if you’re not playing.Instead of trying to change your mom, I suggest you focus your energy on learning how to manage your feelings. If you find yourself getting hooked into a fight, take a deep breath, apologize for letting your temper get the best of you, and respectfully suggest that the two of you talk at another time. Then leave the situation. It’s good practice for you. It will model for your mother how you would like the two of you to relate.Meanwhile, you need to find a better group of friends. Everyone needs people to talk to who understand and support them. Think about joining a sport or club or volunteer at a project that interests you. People who join up to the same things usually have things in common. Start being friendly and you’ll probably start finding people to hang out with.I also suggest you start finding other adults to talk to. It could be a relative or a teacher or a coach or the mother of one of those new friends. That person can give you an adult perspective on things without the emotional overlay of a parent. I suspect that when you drop the fight and find other ways to siphon the stress out of the family some, your mom will be more able to manage your feelings and your opinions.While you are building a network of support for yourself, I suggest you consider using one of the online or phone warm lines when you need someone to talk to. The Boys Town Hotline has counselors on duty 24/7 to talk to teens who are feeling depressed or who just want to sort things out. Yes, they talk to girls too. The number is 800-448-3000.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

This is very difficult for me. I am a 19 year old female who feels more like a kid than a woman. I think the problem is that I still haven’t come to terms with my adulthood. I don’t drive, don’t know how and honestly don’t want to get my license. I have basic cooking skills, but I’m more of a burden in the kitchen than a major help. I don’t turn around when people address me by “Ma’am” or even “Miss”. I find it terribly awkward when adults talk to me in a tone they would use with other adults. Whenever I’m with a group of my peers or older adults I feel as if I don’t belong in the conversation, and I find it strange to have a one-on-one “adult” conversation with somebody. It’s really hard to explain. I’ve heard some people describe me as innocent and pure-hearted but idk. I feel strange. I feel like a child. And I know with the way I act I portray myself as someone submissive, needs to be protected, guided, and dealt with patience. A few years back it didn’t bother me much but now that I’m older and starting to make my way into the world, I’ve been noticing I’m not like others my age. I don’t identify as an adult. I get confused and frustrated when I’m presented with tasks that I feel are too much for me or when I’m treated a certain way. Not unkindly, but with a weight. Its just so confusing and frustrating. I get irritated when I feel I didn’t act like an adult and lash out at my family. How can I find out what’s wrong with me?<|im_end|>

 One is considered an adult at the age of 18 but what does this really mean? In the United States, it means that you can vote or fight in a war, among other things. Biologically, one is considered an adult when he or she reaches puberty. With regard to the brain, it is now commonly accepted in the scientific community that the adolescent brain is not fully developed until the age of 25. In light of those facts, 18, as the age of adulthood, seems rather arbitrary.You seem to have arbitrarily decided that a 19-year-old adult “should” be behaving in a particular manner. In your mind, there is a particular standard that you are not meeting. Your comparisons are based on your perception of how others your age are behaving. The problem with arbitrary guidelines and standards is that they are not often based on reality and thus may be inaccurate.You stated that you portray yourself as submissive. You feel that you need to be protected, guided and described yourself as someone who is easily confused. At the heart of this issue may be a lack of self-confidence. You may feel disempowered or that you do not have the capacity to be independent.For instance, you have not obtained your driver’s license and are not certain that you want to. It would be interesting to know more about why you don’t want a drivers license. If the reason is because driving frightens or intimidates you, then this could be an issue of a lack of self-confidence.With regard to cooking, there is no standard age by which someone is expected to know how to cook. Some people never learn how to cook. Some people have no interest. Culinary skills take years to develop. They are not skills that individuals are born knowing. It often takes many years of training to develop good culinary skills. The fact that you have difficulty with cooking simply means you have yet to learn those skills; it is not a sign that something is “wrong” with you.At 19, lacking self-confidence is relatively normal but it is something that can be overcome. One generally develops self-esteem and self-confidence through life accomplishments. The fact that you have identified this as an issue is a good first step. My recommendation would be to see a therapist to discuss these issues in more depth. He or she could thoroughly analyze the situation and assist you in developing the necessary skills to be successful in life.I would also recommend devoting yourself to gaining knowledge in every area that interests you. For instance, if you want to learn how to cook, take a class, practice at home and read the best cooking books. Knowledge is empowering. The more knowledge that you have in an area, the more confidence you will feel. I wish you the best. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I have a boyfriend. There’s some problem going on so we had to go on separate ways. We’re breaking up next week and we want to end everything as clean as possible. We we’re talking about it one afternoon when all of a sudden he told me he wanted to say something important to me on the day we’ll break up. I asked him why can’t he say it now and he said I might get mad at him. I insisted and he suddenly blurted out, “I still love her” (referring to the girl he was courting before me). He said it in a serious face and all I could say was “really?”. All of a sudden his expression changed and he said it was only a joke. He said he only wanted me to get mad at him and that he really loves me and no one else. I don’t know if I should just consider it as a joke for I have my own suspicions myself. I don’t know if dreams are really that accurate but it’s actually bugging me lately. There was a time I dreamt of a girl my boyfriend was really close with and he was cheating on me. After a few days, I asked him, if he hadn’t met me, who would he court. His answer was that particular girl i just dreamt about. Then just last week, I had another dream that he was again, cheating on me. I dreamt that he was texting his “ex-crush” while I pretend to be sleeping. Then after a few days, he told me that “not so nice” joke.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Your soon-to-be ex is toying with you. He deliberately tries to upset you and then makes a joke about it. Making a joke about a subject that he knows bothers you is very insensitive. He may be doing it as a way to judge how important he is to you. It’s like saying “don’t take me for granted because I could leave you any time.” He may also do it because it prompts a reaction from you. In other words, he does it because he can. If he brought up his ex-crush and you had no reaction, he would probably stop.You asked about how you could get him to tell you the truth. You can’t. You can’t force someone to do anything. The problem is that he’s untrustworthy. He has lied to you on several occasions. It is difficult to have a relationship with someone who violates the basic tenets of a good relationship, honesty without deception.If he were in love with his ex-crush he could’ve kept it a secret. I am not saying that would have been the correct way to handle this situation but the point is that most individuals can keep secrets. He chooses not to and instead brings up the topic of his ex-crush seemingly for the purpose of deliberately upsetting you. He does this at your emotional expense, without concern about how it makes you feel. Not only is this type of behavior insensitive but it shows a high level of emotional immaturity.You wrote in your letter that you and he have decided to break up “next week.” The fact is that once you have decided to break up you’ve already broken up. The relationship is over, perhaps for the better. Thanks for writing. I wish you the best of luck.<|im_end|>"

My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 months and it’s really been getting serious and we’re in a long distance relationship. I met his family and friends and they absolutely love me. He met my family and friends and they absolutely love him. Before I met my boyfriend I used to smoke pot on and off. Then I decided to quit and he said “That’s great, but if you were to continue my feelings for you would be the same.” I still quit anyways. Then a few weeks ago I smoked with some friends to relieve the stress in my life and I hadn’t talked to my boyfriend at all that week. So I told him about it because I love him and I tell him everything. When I told him, he flipped out on me and said I was a liar and deceitful and that his opinion of me had lessoned. Then he ended the conversation by saying “I need to think about where we’re going.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
It sounds to me like your boyfriend is a fundamentally nice guy who doesn’t want to hurt you but who isn’t ready for the relationship you want. As a result, he reassures you by telling you it’s not about you. He doesn’t say anything definite but beats around the bush. Then he disappears for days at a time. He doesn’t realize that by trying so hard not to hurt you, he is hurting you even more. This kind of on again off again situation is very, very painful for the person who isn’t in control of it.Analyzing him isn’t going to help. Accept that he’s telling you in the only way he can that he is backing off. Now you need to do the same. I know it’s disappointing. I know it hurts. It’s sad and frustrating when everything but the timing looks so right. For the sake of your own dignity, end it. You can’t be friends with him right now. It will be too hard since you see him as perfect for you. Grieve this relationship and move on.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 Your therapist is the person in the best position to help you. He or she knows you well and can provide the support and guidance you need. But a therapist only has what you share to go on. You are depriving yourself of your therapist’s best efforts by withholding such important information.Please put your embarrassment aside. Consider showing your letter and this response to your therapist as a way to ease into the conversation. A therapist’s job is not to judge but to help. My guess is that, once you open up, pieces of the puzzle of your distress will immediately start to fall into place. It’s very possible that the conversation will begin a new and important chapter in your healing.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From Taiwan: I used to live in one country, and it didn’t have opportunities for my career so I relocated. But in that country, I could go outside and easily find my “type” of girl I’m attracted to. It gave me motivation to improve myself as a man, and hope of finding my type of girl. It made me feel alive.<|im_end|>

 I agree. The problem is in the mind, not in the people you are meeting. It’s interesting to me that you have created an idea that you can have either career opportunities or attractive women. In your former country, you got affirmation from the pursuit of women. In this country, you get satisfaction from work. This is simply not a reasonable position.I suspect that you are having a more difficult time adjusting to your new country than you are admitting. It’s possible that you have compartmentalized your anxiety and uncertainties into this one issue. By “blaming” other people for not being your type, you avoid having to deal with your own lack of confidence. Perhaps?I think your feelings are telling you that, at 30, it’s time for you to bring your work life and your social life into balance. There are beautiful people everywhere. Look beyond your prejudices. Pursuing your “type” didn’t result in finding a life partner. It’s probably time you changed your criteria.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 Whenever you notice a potential problem developing, it is wise to seek help. Mental health professionals are trained to deal with these types of problems. Counseling is the process of analyzing one’s thoughts to determine if an individual’s thinking is consistent with reality. Counseling would be the ideal solution to this problem.People engage in self-harm whenever they don’t feel good about themselves. Self-harm is self-punishment. By its very nature, it is self-destructive. It’s a maladaptive attempt at solving one’s problems.Counseling, on the other hand, is the opposite of maladaptive coping. It’s the purposeful learning of problem-solving skills. We are not born knowing how to solve our own problems. Everyone faces life problems, but not everyone is equipped with the proper skill set to manage these problems. These skills must be learned. In the absence of problem-solving skills, people tend to engage in maladaptive strategies such as self-harm.I would strongly recommend counseling. Ask your primary care physician for referral. Some primary care physicians even have in-house licensed clinical social workers to assist patients with more immediate psychological care. Perhaps your primary care physician has such a service. If not, he or she can refer you to a counselor in the community. The sooner you seek help, the sooner you can stabilize your mood. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 I’m very glad you wrote. Let’s start with your last paragraph: Your personality isn’t irredeemable and evil. Past wrong-doings co not necessarily define a person. Self-absorbed people, especially self-absorbed teens, do not necessarily develop a Narcissistic Personality. Exposure and Response Therapy is not the only way to manage Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.Your letter tells me that you are insightful and intelligent. How you move forward in life is entirely up to you. You may not be able to access professional help, but you can start working on your various issues today — right now.“Bibliotherapy” (reading) is available to everyone. There is plenty of information on the web about how to manage obsessional thoughts. There is also a great deal of information on the difference between the normal narcissism of the teen years and the abnormal narcissism of a personality disorder. There is also a ton of information about recovering from bullying. Use your considerable intellect to think about what you read and to try out suggestions.You might find it helpful to join one of the forums here at PsychCentral. People from all over the world offer each other support and advice.Don’t give up on getting some therapy. Talk to your school counselor or physician about whether there are programs in your city that offer free or very low cost therapy to teens.In the mean time: I hope you are working hard in school so that you are eligible for further education or a well paying job. I hope you are either volunteering or working part time in order to develop skills that will make it possible for you to get a good job and to move out of your parents’ home when you graduate.

I’m prone to overreacting every once in a while, I’ll usually throw a fit in my room at night and try to be quiet (hitting pillows, crying, screaming into pillows) which I’m sure is ordinary. The real problem is I seem to be missing something. I’m too…open-eyed, I guess. I sit around with a stupid smile on my face. At school, I feel uncomfortable if people try to sit next to me at lunch, so I sit on my own and read, and this doesn’t bother me at all! But my mother thinks I’m hurting myself (socially), but she doesn’t seem to understand how strained I feel when I’m put into a situation I don’t like. On the other hand, when I do feel chatty, I always seem to mention topics that aren’t related, or I steer the conversation towards me, or I’m unintentionally mean. I try to remind myself not to behave that way, but every time I talk it seems like I mess everything up. I think about things no one else really cares about. I’m not sure if my personality is weird or if something is actually going on with my brain that doesn’t happen with everyone else, because even introverts (i think) have their own little group of friends to sit with, even if they don’t talk, but I feel stifled and nervous when I haven’t started talking on my own terms. I’ve started noticing that I take nudges and pushes a little too seriously, and when I try to replicate that playful atmosphere with my siblings I end up hurting them or angering them. Everyone gives me a hard time because of it. My siblings make me feel guilty. Once I had politely declined an offer from a nice girl who wanted me to come and sit with her and her friends, and when I later on related it to my mother, she was upset that I didn’t accept the offer and told me that I wasn’t going to make many friends if I was rude like that. There’s also the fact that I act a lot like a child and can be loud and annoying, and I feel like I interrupt people all the time. I just love being alone and feel agitated if someone, like one sibling of mine often does, impedes my private space unannounced. Thank you for listening.<|im_end|>

 Being a teenager is difficult, much more so than many people realize. Most teenagers can relate to your experiences. All of the things that you have written about have probably been felt and are being felt by teenagers across the world. They worry about fitting in. They want people to like them. They worry about embarrassing themselves in front of others, and so on.Your mother seems to be concerned about your wanting to be alone. Her concerns may be valid. The key to knowing if there’s a problem is determining the reason you want to be alone. If it’s because you want to collect your thoughts or read a book or focus on a project, then those are normal and healthy reasons. If it’s driven by nervousness or fear, then that’s a problem. It might suggest that your avoidance of people is due to anxiety. It would be unhealthy to avoid social situations because of fear. Doing so would reinforce your fear and could make your anxiety worse.It’s normal to want to be alone, sometimes, but not all of the time. It’s expected that you would want to socialize and make friends. You might try talking to your mother about this issue or better yet, consulting the school guidance counselor or a therapist. Therapists specialize in understanding relationships and social interaction. You could greatly benefit from their professional advice and guidance. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I have a 52-year-old single, never married sister who has always been psychologically immature. She was the youngest of four siblings. My mother coddled her because she was the youngest. She had a couple of low paying jobs after high school then was eligible for paid schooling under a government program. She did well in a two-year business school. She found a job where she could work from home in the field she was qualified for.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 This is so, so hard. You and your parents meant well but, unfortunately, what your sister learned from having so much generous help is that she doesn’t need to help herself. She has figured out that if it looks like she’ll “end up on the streets”, you can’t stand it and will help her even though you said you wouldn’t. She isn’t going to believe you now unless you can figure out how to make it clear to her that the gravy train has stopped.Since you are older than she is, you are close to retirement. You probably can’t support her anymore and be able to manage a reasonable retirement for yourself. It’s long past time for you to be more selfish and to take better care of yourself. That means steeling yourself to let your sister deal with the natural consequences of her own behavior.Someone who “can’t be bothered” looking for a job and who won’t apply for benefits is creating her own crisis. She may have to be homeless before she gets it that she has to do what other adults have to do. If she does become homeless, you can give her the phone number of the public services that help people figure out how to apply for benefits and get housing. You can’t cave in — unless you are willing to continue to take care of her at your own expense until one of you dies.You may need some support to hold onto while you make such a major change. For that reason, I do suggest you make an appointment with a therapist for some help.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

This issue never plagued me until midway through high school. I have never cut or tried to harm myself in any way. In middle school, I had a friend who battled depression and would cut herself. However, the issue finally started one day when I found a video that talked about a fan of a band who was so crazy for them that she had cut one of the band member’s name into her arm. It didn’t affect me as much at first, and only left me thinking about why anybody would do such a thing. When the video showed the photo of the cut arm, that’s when it hit.<|im_end|>

 You may be describing a phobia. For unclear reasons, you had a strong emotional reaction to that photo. As a response, you began actively avoiding similar photos. Your active avoidance of these photos has strengthened your fear. Continued avoidance will likely increase rather than decrease your fear.Generally speaking, researchers have a limited understanding as to why people develop phobias. The good news is that treatment for phobias is highly effective. Phobias can be treated successfully even when you do not know their origin.I would recommend consulting a mental health professional who specializes in phobias and anxiety. They could help you extinguish your fear. One of the best types of treatments for phobias is exposure therapy. Exposure therapy is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy. Many studies have shown that exposure therapy cures phobias. Discuss this issue with your parents and ask them to help you find the best treatment. Thanks for writing and good luck.<|im_end|>"

My boyfriend says he will break up with me if I don’t stop doing this thing that I do. He says it’s my childish attitude but I’ll try to be more specific. This happens when I get my feelings hurt. I deal with my emotions in front of other people and affect them instead of dealing with my emotions in private. I ruin plans or create drama/a scene by either reacting outwardly with my emotions (screaming/throwing a fit but I do that much less than I used to) or I react passively where I still show that I am upset but instead of being just plain aggressive, I am passive aggressive where I run out of the room drawing attention to me and I affect those around me and often ruining the vibe/good time.

 Thank you for sending us your email. Your courageous self examination is an excellent way to begin getting to the bottom of this. You acting out (and acting in) when your feelings are hurt are indicators of a need for greater self-regulation and self control. The very fact that you are now aware of this, have written us here, and are looking for ways to cope are the necessary ingredients for change. It is a good start. I’d recommend therapy focused on developing coping skills with these impulses. Along the way developing a meditation practice can be a terrific way to begin developing these emotional muscles.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

 Self-harm may indicate that: (1) you lack effective problem-solving skills and or; (2) you are unhappy with your life. Happy people don’t engage in self-harm. It simply doesn’t cross their minds.The path to self-harm is precipitated by strong emotions. People who engage in self-harm might do so because they don’t possess good coping skills. They’re searching for a release. Perhaps the physical sensation that accompanies self-harm provides them with some relief but it’s short-lived. It will always make the situation worse.Have you explored why you continually find yourself experiencing strong emotions? We all occasionally experience strong emotions but it should not be an everyday occurrence. Our mood can be impacted by lack of sleep, medication, hormones, among other things but day-to-day, it should be stable. If your emotions were more stable, you might feel less driven to engage in self-harm.Self-harm is often the result of self-directed blame and anger. If you’re willing to hurt yourself, then you must believe that you deserve pain and suffering. You don’t; no one does.Many people who engage in self-harm also report feeling unworthy and lacking self-esteem. That type of self-defeating thinking is often irrational and illogical.You have a history of seeking help. That’s promising. It shows that you are open to treatment. My advice is to consult a therapist. Medication might also be helpful but you will need to review that decision with your treating professionals.You don’t have to suffer. Help is available. All you have to do is decide to seek help. I hope you will make the right choice. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

We used to be really good friends, but even then, I was constantly left out since two of them were best friends, the other two were best friends, and I was the extra. Lately, they’ve been starting to think I’m annoying. They constantly talk in a group chat without me. They’ve made so many plans without me. At school, they still talk to me and endure me.<|im_end|>

 This sounds terrible. You seem to be surrounded by toxic people who hurt you and use you. Sadly, not everyone gets the family they deserve. Also sadly, a person who is used to being put down often finds “friends” who continue the negativity. One of my teachers used to caution us never to underestimate the pull of the familiar.The good news is that you are 17. You’ve written a thoughtful and reflective letter. That shows me that you have it in you to discontinue the trajectory of life you’ve been on. You can make new choices.I suggest you start separating from this friend group and make yourself available to people who will give as well as take, who will see you for the interesting person you are and who will be there for you.The best way to do this is to identify an activity that truly interests you and get involved. Like attracts like. People who like the same things are often interested in knowing each other. Don’t be concerned, at first, with making friends. Just throw yourself into the activity or cause and be your best self. Friendships will naturally evolve.Meanwhile, spend less time at home. Go to a library or stay after school during the afternoons. Work hard on your grades. Talk to your school counselor about whether you qualify for a scholarship to college. Round out your resume by doing some volunteer work or getting a part time job for work experience.In another year, you could go off to school and make a new start. If you aren’t interested in more school, start looking for job or volunteer opportunities that will take you out of your town and into new experiences with new people.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My sister has autism spectrum disorder, she always had problems with depression and anxiety. She always spoke to herself when we were younger, but about a year ago she got hit by a car and fractured her skull in 12 places. And now she’s different, she has violent tendencies and she says she thinks people are talking about her or staring at her when no one is, she thought my mom and aunt were talking about her but we haven’t seen her in over a month so she couldn’t have known at all. She thinks everyone is out to get her. I tried looking up schizophrenia and the stages of it but it doesn’t quite match up. She feels every emotion, she is very caring, but she needs help but won’t get it because she thinks what she’s hearing is true.<|im_end|>

 Not having interviewed your sister negates my ability to know what might be wrong. You mentioned that she was in a severe accident involving head trauma. It’s possible that she had sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI). There are many examples in the scientific literature where an individual sustains head trauma and subsequently experiences a change in personality. A neurologist or a physician who specializes in TBI could provide insight into her symptoms. Medication and or psychotherapy could help.Relatedly, you might try joining a support group for family members who have a loved one with TBI. It could be helpful to share your experiences with other people in similar circumstances. Try googling “TBI support groups” and your ZIP Code. There are support groups and organizations worldwide.Ideally, your sister should be examined by a specialist to determine what might be wrong. An evaluation might uncover the source of her change in personality. Her doctor would be in the best position to treat her symptoms. I hope this helps you know how to proceed. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 I’ve been happily married for 22 years. For 15 of those years, I thought I had a good relationship with both my in-laws. FIL called me “number 1” and loved me, but he passed away 3 years ago. I bent over backwards for both of them. Things changed about 7 years ago when I suddenly found out my MIL “can’t stand” me. I don’t take it personally because she is rude and offensive to everyone, however I did stop making all the effort in the relationship. But since then our relationship and her behavior keeps getting worse. My MIL prefers to be able to be mean and yell then state she doesn’t want to talk about it and storms off. Then later on she will pretend that nothing happened and pretend to be cheery (she has taken medication for depression for decades so pretend is the right word). If I try to bring up our problems to sit down with her and calmly talk through them, she blows me off and says “why are you so difficult?”.<|im_end|>

 Please listen to your husband. He’s giving you good advice. Even better, he has stood up for you and given you ongoing support. Like his father before him, he’s acting as a buffer between you and his impossible mother.This difficult woman isn’t about to change, no matter what you say or do. She has been this way forever. She sees no reason to put in the effort to be more agreeable. She doesn’t care about the relationship as much as you do. Let it go.The best thing to do in such a situation is to take the high road and do what makes you feel best about yourself. That probably means occasionally going along when there’s a family event, cooking dinner for her now and then, and including her in holidays. Just because someone is mean doesn’t mean that it’s okay to answer in kind. Instead, you can come up with a few stock phrases when she is critical or offensive. “I’ll think about it.” “Thank you for the input.” “I know what you mean.” Such statements don’t commit you to anything but keep the social wheels moving.Explain to the kids that you put up with her because she is old and she is family. Let them know they should be polite, as you are, but that they don’t have to take her rudeness personally or seriously. She’s a sad, sad person. When she leaves, you can all breathe a sigh of relief and be happy that you don’t see the world as she does.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My partner started talking to a girl through a game. It quickly escalated with her asking him to get an app kik so they could talk more. I thought this was inappropriate but he did it anyway. They started taking heaps. Seemed like she was flirting with him. He said they were just friends. Then I found out they were messaging each other for hours on end, till late in the night (time difference for countries) but I asked to read the messages. They were falling asleep talking to each other, she calling him cute, they are both saying how fun the other one is and how close they feel to each other like best friends. She was saying how he must be unable to sleep cause he missed her and he said she could be right. In another part she was saying how she cries in movies and gets really into the story etc and he said he wished he could watch a movie with her so he could watch her reactions! I was devastated. That is extremely intimate. They also mentioned about if the visited each others countries how it would be cool to meet up. Yet when I try message him I can’t strike up a conversation. I told him he was cheating on me. Having an emotional affair. They knew and said I wouldn’t like the messages, he deleted some at one point, guards his phone with his life, they’ve only been talking for acouple weeks. He has not been intimate with me since they started talking. He’s broken my heart and says I am over reacting and irrational. He genuinely does not believe this is wrong. Just because sex hasn’t been mentioned. He does not know any guidelines as to boundaries for friendships with the opposite sex. Do you think I am over reacting? I feel betrayed. I trusted him to never hurt me like this. I told him to stop talking to her. Am I right in doing so?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You’re not overreacting. This is an emotional affair, and while only half of emotional affairs end in something physical, the bottom line is there is a betrayal of intimacy. The fact that your partner doesn’t honor your feelings with this, chooses to continue even though it upsets you, and it has escalated all point to the fact you must take this very seriously. His trying to minimize it and saying that you are irrational doesn’t change the fact. It upsets you and he continues to do it anyway. I strongly recommend couples counseling over this. Keep the issue on the front burner. In my experience and in the experience of many therapists, an emotional affair can be easily as devastating as a physical one.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From a young woman in the U.S.: Hi! I have bpd (with no known comorbidity) and for a while now I;ve been dissociating to the point where I’ve been told I’ve gone through my day like normal (or like I’m half asleep in some cases) and I wasn’t there for anything. Like I’d come out and not remember that I just went to work or did laundry, normal stuff. I’ve had entire conversations that I don’t remember having. How could I just black out and go on with my day if I’m not there??? There are some times wehere I also feel like I’m dreaming constantly. Are any of these symptoms normal for bpd? I haven’t been seen by a professional in ages and I just wonder if this is “normal” for bpd.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The most important thing you said is that you haven’t seen a professional “in ages”.  Diagnoses are the therapist’s best understanding at the time. Often as people’s treatment progresses or as a person matures, the diagnosis may shift. You really do need to go back to whoever diagnosed you in the first place to explain what has been happening. That person already knows a great deal of your history and can put it together with your present situation. Please follow through and make that appointment. If you are concerned that you may not be able to describe your experience well, just bring along your letter. You did a good job stating your concerns.To answer your question: “How could I just black out and go on with my day?” Issues that can contribute to memory issues in young adults are depression, a sleep disorder, under-active thyroid and chronic stress. A side effect of some medications can also be the problem. Alcohol and substance abuse are also possible contributing factors. Since you have a history of borderline personality disorder, that you may inflate or deflate your experiences.But do bear in mind that everyone has moments like this. You may be able to relate: Sometimes when we drive on a familiar route, we are surprised to see that we are further along than we thought we were. That does not indicate “blacking out”. Being very familiar with a routine lets a person put primary attention on something else while still safely carrying on the routine task. “Normal stuff” like doing your laundry is so routine that it allows your mind to think about other things.Another possibility is that you dissociate more profoundly than you think you do. Sometimes this indicates Dissociative Identity Disorder where an “alter” personality who takes over. If you have a trauma history, this is something to explore. An indication that this might be the problem is your report that you have conversations you can’t remember. You need to talk to an experienced, licensed professional who specializes in trauma to decide if this might be true for you.Without knowing you, I can only offer the list of possibilities. Please go back to your therapist for a complete evaluation.You wrote to us because whatever is going on is troubling to you. I think you should take you instincts seriously. You know something isn’t right. See your therapist as soon as possible.I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: My question is, I have dealt with OCD intrusive thoughts (religious mostly),general anxiety, and social anxiety since I was 12 years old (my grandfather had to have shock treatments for the same thing and was in a psych ward for 6 months when he was in his 40s, he has been on Thorazine ever since). I have been to the doctor about it and have been on antidepressants (SSRIs: Paxil, Zoloft and SNRIs: Effexor, Cymbalta) more than those I know, I just can’t think of all right now. None of the meds have really helped a lot. I have also had horrible insomnia for years due to the ocd intrusive thoughts so much so that I would take tons of Tylenol pm just to get to sleep at night, it ended up almost ruining my liver.<|im_end|>

 You wouldn’t go to a pediatrician if you had cancer. You wouldn’t go to a kidney specialist if you had heart trouble. All doctors are not alike. Sometimes we have to go to the right specialist to get the help we need. In your case, you need both a psychiatrist and a therapist who work together to get the right care.The treatment of choice for your problems is a combination of medication and talk therapy. OCD and anxiety disorders can be treated and managed successfully. Generally, patients see their therapist weekly and, after an initial period of weekly visits to get the medication right, they see their psychiatrist every few months. When the two professionals are working in the same practice, they are able to confer with each other easily and work together to give you good care.I understand that you have been afraid to see a mental health professional because of your grandfather’s experience. But treatments have changed considerably since your grandfather’s time. From the little you shared, I also suspect he had a much different problem.To find a specialist, ask your primary care doctor for a referral to a practice. You can also go to the “Therapist Locator” on the homepage of PsychCentral.Please don’t hesitate to make an appointment for an initial session. The clinician will listen to your story and will make suggestions. (Take your letter with you if you want to jump start the conversation.) You are under no obligation to follow through with the treatment plan that is proposed. But I hope you do. You’ve suffered far too long.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 Me and my girlfriend have been together for around 19 months now but in January we had a rough patch and took a break, the reason for that break was she got Postnatal depression 6 months after our daughter was born and she became very confused about her self and started going out with friends a lot and drinking too which I had no issue with as she had done an amazing job being a mother and she deserved the time to let her hair down, within the times she went out she met a lad that worked at the local bowling alley and they hooked up a few times after and admitted to “Kissing” him whilst we we’re together. During the break we had she admitted that she had slept with the lad on one occasion My reaction wasn’t explosive because we agreed to have a break and that’s her decision to sleep with him yes it hurt me a lot but I couldn’t “Go Crazy” after 2 months apart my girlfriend tells me she wants to get thing back on track, I was so thrilled that she decided this but now after a month of so she has started to go very quiet with me and less talkative, and the issue my Girlfriend has is when she has things on her mind she speaks about them in her sleep, and a few nights ago she was speaking as if she was talking to someone and her word was “I think I have fucked up getting back with Jamie (my name BTW), as I can only think about someone else. I have confronted her but she denies that she likes someone else and that she loves me, this is now making me confused, now earlier this morning (21/04/2011) she spoke in her sleep saying she was thinking a lot about this person and it is really concerning me, my main question is does she want me because she grew up without her father and she wants me there for ours or what.<|im_end|>

 What a difficult place to be in. I think one way of understanding this is that you are both confused about the level of commitment needed to sustain the relationship. It also seems that the two of you may not be able to deal effectively with communicating these truths. If a child were not involved you would be able to deal with this by simply moving on, but the truth is the two of you will have to communicate over your child whether you are together or not.I would strongly suggest a couples counselor because there are a great many unresolved feelings that need to be identified and dealt with. This will help you not only if you decide to stay together, but also if you decide to separate and continue making decisions for your child.If she is unwilling to enter couples therapy I would suggest you begin individual therapy to sort through the issues evoked by all of this.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Eight years ago I fell in love with this beautiful young girl and after 4 years dating we got married and after 4 years of marriage we were blessed with a beautiful young girl. After living in UK, she decided we must move back to our home country because she said that her parents are old and if anything happens to them she could not forgive her self and because I love my wife so much I agreed but this is where the nightmare began. We faced some problems in the UK specially financially but we where happy—but with my bad luck I was diagnosed   with epilepsy and that started problems that she accused me of having this problem since I was a kid that I have lied to her (I swear I never had a problem) and then after birth she kept saying she has depression which she went to the doctors  and was receiving treatment but she didn’t finish the treatment and promised when we go back to our home country  she will continue which she never followed, after only 3 months of going back suddenly after no where she asked me for a divorce which rocked my whole world I couldn’t believe.   This is the same person I fell in love with she asked lets go  to therapy which we did, after the therapy  she said I want to give our marriage another chance but after speaking to her father and mother she came back and said nope I don’t want it anymore then I found email to her therapist  saying she can’t go on anymore and even she mentioned when of her old boyfriends (which brought any excuses not to be with her ) and left her .<|im_end|>

From the U.S.: I am transgender and have been living as male for two years. So my transition is going great, and I almost have zero depression or dysphoria. Which is awesome, but something else has happened in the past couple of years, and I have only really noticed it recently. And I haven’t told anyone about this either.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I can only offer a guess. You really need to talk this over with a therapist who can hear your whole story and who can ask the follow-up questions that need to be asked to come to a real understanding.So here’s my guess: No news to you, transition is difficult. You started the process when you were only 16. That’s a time when most teens are working out who they are and how to relate to others. You were working on an additional layer of concerns and, perhaps, fears. The need to have compassion for yourself may have overwhelmed your ability to have compassion for others.Feeling our feelings and knowing what to do with them is part of the process of maturing. In your case, you may have put off some of that developmental task while you came to terms with who you are.If you aren’t in therapy already, I urge you to find an experienced trans-friendly counselor to provide you with guidance and support as you work on becoming all you can be.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

When I was a little boy, I would have eccentric, restricted repetitive behaviors, interests, and activities. I already knew how to read when I was three years old. I would memorize TV commercials and all the logos in them. I would create towers with plastic letters, I would get obsessed with topics such as dinosaurs, then animals, then comics and books, etc. I’ve always had strange, rare and obsessive thoughts, for example, when I was very young: I would visualize the sentence: “God is an idiot” in the Argentinian flag. I would try to stop the thought but I was unable to do it. I would fear words like “NO” or “STOP” for no reason and my mind would just keep making me remember those words during night. I would easily memorize long digits, movie scripts and logos. I also was a little clumsy, I would fall to the ground for no reason. I had trouble paying attention; I would play with my colored pencils during class. All these traits, plus my current behavior (intimacy avoidance, social withdrawal, lack of empathy, lack of eye contact, repetitive motor movements) were enough for my neurologist to diagnose me with Aspergers Syndrome. I was also told that I had superiority feelings (I guess it is a defense mechanism because when I was a kid, a psychologist told my mother that I had inferiority feelings and I am not a narcissistic at all), but there are thoughts in my brain that make me wonder if the diagnosis was incorrect. I don’t know if they are the same OCD type thoughts that I had as a kid but these thoughts tell me that I am a narcissistic person, that I am misdiagnosed, I can“t really explain those thoughts but they are confusing me. I was diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder before being diagnosed with Aspergers. I do understand sarcasm. I do understand most non verbal cues. These thoughts just confuse me, and I feel like I do not know the truth about myself. What are these thoughts exactly? Are they common in other cases of Aspergers?<|im_end|>

 In the newest version of the manual professionals used to diagnose mental health disorders, Asperger’s has been re-categorized as an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Additional distinctions are made based upon the severity of the disorder. Severity levels are determined by how much an individual struggles with social communication and repetitive behavior patterns.People with autism spectrum disorders have difficulty with social communication and social interaction in multiple areas of their lives. You may have deficits in some of these abilities and less or no deficits in others. The continuum allows for a range of skills and symptoms.Many of the symptoms you described are characteristic of people with ASD’s. Based upon the information you provided, it seems to be the best diagnostic fit, but your diagnosing physicians would be in the best position to know since they interviewed you in person and collected an extensive personal history. Asperger’s was the diagnosis they believe best fit your symptoms. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Me and my boyfriend are 17 years old and both will be turning 18 in a couple of months. My boyfriend bit me and left me a bruise on my arm but he said he didn’t mean to it was by accident and he was just playful biting me. Today he pulled my hair and said he didn’t meant to pull it hard he was just trying to get my attention and so. Later that day he took my car keys and wouldn’t give it back to me so i started screaming at him and my phone called my mom by itself and she heard the argument. she heard me screaming at the top of my lungs. I’m not the type of person to yell unless i am very upset. so he takes the keys and throws it on top of a tree and tells me “try and get it now” so when i got it down i turned on the car. I was parked in a parking lot. He took my scarf and threw it out the window and every time i tried to get it he gets it and throws it out the window again and again. then he took my scarf and rubbed it against the car and was cleaning the car with my scarf. after all this he said he was just playing and was trying to get me calm because i was very upset. My parents think he is showing signs of abuse towards me. And they do not want me with him. What should i do or think? Is he really showing signs of abuse?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Your parents are right. There is a pattern of behavior here that has physically hurt you by both biting and pulling your hair. He antagonized you by taking the car keys, upsetting you, escalating the situation by throwing the keys in the tree (which forces you to risk injury by climbing). He antagonized you further by repeatedly throwing your scarf out the window, and then provoked you further by wiping the car with it. The excuse that he was trying to calm you is simply a lie. If he was trying to calm you he was doing a horrible job and should have realized it. The fact that he can either not tell that he is making you upset, or is lying and is trying to make you upset is cause for concern.You do not need to be with anyone that bullies, antagonize, and provokes you and then says he is doing it in the name of calming you down. Whatever his problem is, don’t let it become yours.Your parents are right and it is time for you to have people in your life who will treat you better.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

My mother has always had a strong attachment to my oldest brother and been rather detached and resentful of us other kids. She didn’t talk to us or show us physical affection or spend much time with us. she was never there and when she was it still felt like she was absent. She admitted to me that she wished she had only had my oldest brother and not my middle brother or I. she has chosen men and relationships over her children and let us all go and be raised by someone else one time or another throughout our lives. She never asks my oldest brother for anything or blames him for anything. She asks my other brother for things and demands or manipulates things from me. she wishes that my brothers talked to her more and hates that I talk to her so much. when my middle brother almost died she only visited him once in the hospital and helped as little as possible when he went home. she and I used to talk about everything and see each other everyday. I have a broken hip, my own fault, when I told her she cried and said she would come to the hospital immediately then talked only about her relationship for 45 minutes and didn’t come. From then on she only visited when asked for help and only if she had another excuse to be in the area. she only called once of her own accord 3 weeks after surgery, she talked about herself the entire time, begrudgingly asked how I was, then asked if I was still using a walker to get around. I was going to work for her this summer which would have made her life a lot easier for her to see her boyfriend, when I told her that I was going to be laid up for quite a while she offered no sympathy or even acknowledgement and changed the subject back to herself and got off the phone. That was 3 weeks ago and haven’t heard from her since. Sorry its long and broken up by facts-but any insights on what’s going on or what I should do would really help. I would like to resolve this lifelong issue with her and move on with my life.<|im_end|>

  The resolution is in moving on. Your mother seems to lack a core empathy for you and sounds very self-absorbed. You state your age as 26, and I would encourage you to individuate and work on your independence. If your mother hasn’t been able to be there for you, stop expecting she can be. Accept her limitations, forgive her for them, and moving on with your life will help.Alice Miller’s Drama of the Gifted Child, describes the necessary grieving process when breaking away from a narcissistic mother.

Is it true that there should be no normal physical contact (hugging, ect) between a male and his female friend? I have a female friend whom with I have been friends with for about 8 years. We are best friends basically, but when we get around each other it is like we never ever touch. Not intentionally or anything. I do like her and want to be with her because seems like it’s only natural that I would develop feelings for her, right? But even though she may not view me in that manner, isn’t it normal for friends to at least hug? We have never hugged , or shared small physical contact (touching of the shoulder, ect.) Is this normal for close male and female friends? Or is this because our fear of sexual arousal? Could it be a sign that she might be interested in me as well but does not want to ruin the friendship?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
With the little information you’ve provided it is really difficult to determine what she might be feeling towards you. We know that she does not hug you. At least we know that she finds it uncomfortable or thinks that it would be inappropriate. The fact that she does not hug you may mean many things. It may mean that she believes that the two of you are simply friends. Whether or not friends, the intention with which you give a person a hug is completely dependent on the nature of the relationship. There really are no “normal” characteristics of friendship with regard to physical contact, with a few exceptions. Generally, friends do not usually sit on each other’s lap, kiss each other, or engage in sexual relations (I guess unless it is a “friends with benefits,” situation, but that’s a whole different topic).What may be going on is that you are attracted to her and are remaining a “friend” hoping that it becomes something more. If that is what you are doing then I wonder if you really are a “friend” or pretending to be one just to be close to her. She may also sense this and not want to encourage this scenario to play out. Though it’s hard to know what her feelings might be.You may also believe that you and she are more than friends. You seem to have some expectation about her behavior. The proof of this may be that her non-hugging behavior disappoints you.There is only one way to know for certain how she feels about you. Ask her. If you like her then you should tell her. Trying to interpret her behavior (or lack thereof) is nearly impossible and an inefficient use of your time. I’d recommend that you be honest with her about how you feel and when you do, you’ll be closer to the clarity you’ve been wishing for.<|im_end|>"

I loved holding hands with him and cuddling. But after about 4 months I have no interest in touching him or kissing him or even talking to him.

 I can’t determine your sexual orientation on the basis of a letter, of course. What I can tell you is this: Some researchers have said that people are on a continuum from homosexuality to heterosexuality. Some people are clearly one or the other. Lots of people lean one way or another. Still others fall in love with a person, regardless of the gender. You are fortunate to live in a time when it is far more permissible to explore one’s sexuality than in prior generations. The down side is that it can be very confusing.For what it’s worth: I don’t think your feelings about your boyfriend are an indicator of your sexuality. I think you’re just not that into him anymore. As you’ve gotten to know him better, you may have decided that he really isn’t the one for you. Listen to your feelings. Don’t waste his or your own time. Break up kindly and make yourself available to start seeing other people. You’ll figure out who you’re attracted to as you go through the very normal process of self-discovery that goes on at your age.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I hope expressing your feelings helped a little. You’ve been carrying these feelings of helplessness and hopelessness much too long. It must be terrible to feel so alone. I’m sorry you can’t reach to your parents for support. But if you really can’t, you do need to find other people who can help you.In situations as you describe, I always advise people to first consult with their medical doctor. The troubles with concentration and depression just may have a medical cause. It’s at least important to check.If you are medically okay, the next step is to look at lifestyle. Are you keeping regular hours and getting enough sleep? Are you feeding yourself well? Do you get some exercise every day? Perhaps most important, are you spending time with other people? If the answer to those questions is yes, we then move to mental health.I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of a letter, of course, but I can tell you this: There are many people who work hard for a goal and then fall apart on reaching it. It’s as if all the energy was focused on getting to the goal and there is none left for actually enjoying it or working on it.In my practice I’ve seen many young people who were stellar students in high school who then got into a top university and failed. Why? I think at least partly because they are tired; partly because they are competing with other stellar students for the first time and aren’t prepared for it; partly because they are on their own for the first time and don’t have the structure of high school or their parents’ rules to guide them. For these students, university is overwhelming. The response is often acute anxiety and/or depression.If any of those possibilities seem true for you, it would be most helpful for you to see a counselor. You’ve already tried your best to help yourself with little success. It’s time to seek and accept some outside support.I don’t know what resources are available to you in Albania. I suggest that talking with your physician is a good place to start. He or she will know where to refer you. It’s also possible that your university has a counseling center. If so, I encourage you to contact them.If anyone reading thisis familiar with services she can access in her country, please help her out and comment. Thank you.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I have been going to weekly therapy for a year and half, as well as group therapy for the past year (with the same therapist). I am very comfortable with him and feel that we have a good rapport. It was difficult in the beginning because I have a lot of difficulty recognizing and expressing my emotions, but now I think that I have come to trust him. My issues included anxiety, depression, childhood trauma (bullying, divorce, isolation), and a medical condition I have with psychosomatic causes (scarring alopecia). The therapy is not very goal oriented and I don’t have any clear idea on when it might be completed. Though I have gained insight into the way I function and the causes of my distress through much introspection, I can’t say that my issues have gotten much better. I want to believe in him and our relationship…that it can truly help me to form better relationships and minimize some of my depression and anxiety. However, I know I also have to think rationally and evaluate the changes that have been made in the past 18 months.<|im_end|>

  Your therapist sounds like he has been helpful and supportive. The easiest thing to do is for you to put your need for a more goal directive therapy out to him. Therapists have different styles, training, and process — but I can’t imagine a therapist not wanting to honor your need to set goals and make progress toward them.The establishment of the relationship is often key to many transformations in therapy. Now that the relationship has been established, it is time for you to help set the agenda.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I work as a “youth leader” for a residential treatment facility for youths with conduct, psychotic, AOD, or JSO disorders. Recently, I was working one on one with a youth when suddenly the resident got up, grabbed a “weapon,” walked into the hallway and began assaulting a peer. It happened so fast I was unable to stop the resident. Now, I cannot shake the feeling of being a complete failure, or that I could have done something to stop this incident. I face no consequence from work, but still this troubles me. Any searches I have done for support for people in my position: the workers who work directly with residents in mental health facilities, have come back pretty weak. Is their any kind of support for the “cogs” in the mental health field?<|im_end|>

 You should be getting support from your supervisor. Of course you’re upset. Of course you’re on edge. That only tells me that you are a conscientious counselor. I would want people like you on my staff. I certainly would want to keep you.What happened to you is common. The client had the advantage. He was thinking about what he was going to do or he has such poor impulse control that he acted instantaneously. In either case, you were unprepared for how quickly he could move. On top of that, what’s called the “normalcy bias” probably kicked in. When a person can’t quite process what’s going on, the mind is likely to try to put it against an inner template of what is normal. You literally can’t believe what’s happening. By the time your brain says, “Yeah – that’s really happening,” several moments have passed.Those of us in human services all have our first time when we’re caught unawares. I would venture that most of us have regrets we weren’t faster on our feet at the time. But there’s nothing we can do about not knowing what to do that first time. What we can do and should do is learn from it. Once we’ve been surprised like that, we learn what people in our charge are capable of and become more vigilant. Our “normalcy bias” becomes reset. At work, a low level of anxiety kicks in that is in fact useful. It keeps us on our toes. It helps us see potential signs of trouble before the trouble actually happens. It helps us swing into action faster sooner.Unfortunately, it’s often the case that supervisors are so busy with managing their jobs that they don’t think to provide extra support. They’ve become so used to the potential for client acting out that they forget that they were once beginners too. If you think your supervisor could be helpful, I suggest you ask for a supervision session to process what happened. If your supervisor is overworked and unable to provide support, look for a long-timer who can mentor you.Working in a facility such as you describe is hard, challenging work. Please give yourself a break. What matters is how you approach your job now. Apparently your workplace agrees since there haven’t been negative consequences. And thank you. Thank you for working with kids who need every bit of help we can offer them.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

At the age of 17 i was an alcoholic and i smoked until i sat down one day and stopped. i moved and never drank/smoked again. i became homeless so in order to avoid the state taking my child i told his father to take care of him. i became abusive toward a partner because of tiny things. we broke up and i started to fix my life i was constantly in and out of the er because i would be so faint at work . i was told i might be suffering form panic attacks anxiety attacks. after a while i constantly thought about my ex (my abuse victim) after working on it for over 6 months i reached out to my ex. the relationship started up again and was rough but the abuse stopped. finally things started to go better!we got married i got pregnate almost immediately. my family told me he wouldn’t show up to the court house. that he would run.i love him but he is never home he works hard for me and the baby im scared to leave the house. i can stay indoors for weeks at a time if i could. i avoid people at all cost. i cant shake the feeling that im being watched/followed. at the hospital after the birth i had a huge breakdown. a doctor lied to a social worker and told her i live in a shelter. they wouldn’t let me leave with my baby! i begged her to tell me who had accused me of this. i showed proof of my home situation. that my child would be safe. this was the first time i wanted to hurt someone. she told me who it was and i just saw my hand around her neck. my partner was baffled that someone would do this.but he said everything would be ok. he held my hand and that ugly voice got quieter. this woman put in the paperwork that i was to be watched i wont lie i have heard the voice tell me to hurt people myself but i reject anything against the baby.the baby take my mind away from the ugly yet as much as i work on my problems i cant seem to shake my ugly feelings. i dont want to lose my baby.<|im_end|>

 I’m sorry that you have been experiencing these problems. It’s important that you know that mental health professionals can help you. Your partner has helped you on several occasions. It’s good that he can help but he can’t be there all the time. As you noted, he works and you are often left to care for your child alone.In addition to having a new baby and hearing “ugly” voices, you have severe anxiety. It’s so bad that you do not want to leave your home. You need help.It’s particularly important that you treat these problems because of your new baby. Your baby needs you, as his or her primary caregiver, to be emotional stable. If you’re anxious and afraid, so too might your baby.Don’t wait for these problems to go away on their own. Seek professional help. Mental health professionals receive specific training to deal with the very problems with which you are struggling. People can get better with therapy and medication and so can you.Ask the social worker for a referral to mental health treatment. Child protective services is much more likely to let you keep your baby if you are proactively seeking help. Some people might not think so but child protective service workers, want to keep families together. Sometimes they have to take the children away from their parents in order to protect them but their goal is always reunification. Proactively seeking mental health treatment significantly increases the likelihood of keeping your family together. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 Me and my boyfriend have been together for six years, he is the only person that I have ever had any kind of sexual relationship with. Our relationship has always been a little rocky, since we have been together I have caught him talking to numerous girls, I don’t know if he has ever cheated on me with these girls, but I know that he was talking to them, it’s fair to say that I don’t fully trust him because of this. We have been living together for five of the six years that we have been together; but here recently I started a new job where I have met this absolutly amazing guy. He is everything that my boyfriend isn’t. We have kissed but that is as far as it has went. I think that I have fallen for this guy but I don’t know if I should leave the man that I have been with for six years for someone that I have only known for three months. I think that most of my problem is I have only been with my boyfriend, never anybody else. I really need some help trying to figure out what I should do…<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You’ve been living with this guy since you were only 15. Both of you have been deprived of important growing time. The teen years and the early twenties are a time to date different people and to find out who you are in a relationship, who is the kind of person who brings out the best in you, and who you can promise the same. That person is rarely someone you meet at 15 — unless you grew exactly in the same way (unlikely) and rate or you didn’t grow at all (also unlikely).I suggest you trust your feelings and take a big step back from the guy you’ve been with. He’s been feeling restive and drawn to other people too. But neither of you should jump from this relationship right into another. Give yourselves the freedom to discover who you are as an individual first. Then take the time to meet a number of people to see who is a good fit.Forever is a long time. You want to be sure of your choice.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hi I’m a 14 year old girl who’s been suffering from anxiety for as long as I can remember, and I’d like to bring up a new fear that has been bothering me nonstop recently, On Friday I had some friends over for the weekend to hang out, and they suggested we watch a scary movie. I was a little reluctant about the idea, but I did it anyway. Well I really REALLY wish I hadn’t. Ever since then I’ve been afraid (I know it sounds ridiculous) I’ve been afraid of being possessed and hearing voices. There was no fear around this topic until they mentioned watching the movie, so I’m most likely sure that’s how it started, although this is a fear I’ve had in the past, I don’t recall it being this bad. This fear turned into not only the fear of being possessed, but the fear of hearing voices and becoming schizophrenic. It seems like no matter what family tells me I can never seem to believe that everything I’m afraid of are just thoughts. I want to learn how to not doubt that all of my anxiety is really JUST anxiety. It’s been so scary to go to sleep at night, because I’ve been afraid of not waking up in the morning. I’m afraid (not meaning to be graphic) but I’m afraid that I’m going to be possessed and hurt myself in my sleep. I’m almost done with my freshman year of high school, I want to be able to enjoy my life again. My heart is racing just writing this. This morning I started thinking and although I normally have intrusive thoughts, this morning my thoughts didn’t sound like my voice, it was still in my head, but it still terrified me. I’m absolutely terrified, I’m afraid that I’m going to die or develop some kind of psychosis. Please help and respond quickly, I don’t know what I can do. I’m afraid to no end.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It must be difficult to carry around so much anxiety, fear, and to feel you have no control over it. Losing sleep on top of it just adds to the difficulty. I have three recommendations. First, stop watching horror movies and limit your viewing of TV news. The graphic images used in these mediums have been known to exacerbate fears and anxieties.Secondly, I would put together a regular exercise program for yourself. Find out from your gym or health teacher what the best way is to begin. Regular exercise is central to any program that supports well-being.Finally, if these two things don’t help enough ask to speak to your school’s counselor. He or she can help you figure out what to do next.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I’ve been dating this guy for 2 years. When he is “on” it is great. We are able to talk about any subject and have lots of fun and what appears to be a deep connection – we talk about serious subjects, philosophies, growth, the meaning of life, etc. It’s very engaging. This goes on for a few months and then suddenly he turns “off.” One day I wake up and we are not connecting at the “normal” pace (i.e daily phone calls, a few texts, or plans for in person contact). The connection feels severed, there is an edge in his voice, and he is cold. I notice this, give it some space (2-3 days) and then intentionally and gently bring it up. Initially he is defensive but pretty quickly he will acknowledge that yes, he’s withdrawn and eventually some narrative will show up as a reason for the behavior – he felt I disrespected him (I was late returning a call), he felt I abandoned him (I had some trips and so I was out of town), he was nervous that I’d reject some of his behavior that he’d been hiding (he smokes occasionally), etc. The conversations come back on line and we talk about his feelings, needs, and better ways to communicate etc. He does have a therapist and I suggest he work on these issues with his therapist. Then everything goes back to normal until it cycles again.<|im_end|>

Whether or not you should stay with your partner is a very personal decision. That decision can be life altering. If you were to stay with him, the two of you may eventually consider marriage. Should you marry, you will be legally connected to him. This kind of decision requires a great deal of thought as it is one of the most important decisions you may ever make in life.You are right to be concerned. His behavior is problematic for the relationship. The proof of that is the problems it is causing. Should you decide to stay with him and he does not change, then you will have essentially agreed to accept his behavior. Are you willing to live with his behavior?You asked whether there’s anything you can do to soften the blow of his “off” experiences?” That is a difficult question to answer without knowing more about what precipitates these experiences. More information would be necessary to make that determination.If I could interview you in person, I would be interested in how long he has been in counseling and what progress has been made. It would be helpful to know more about what the therapist thinks is wrong? What happens when he shuts down? What is he thinking? Where does he go (literally) when he is like this? Does he stop talking altogether? How long has this been happening? Does he behave this way with other people? When did you notice it developing? What are the precursors to this behavior? Is he angry and hides so as to not physically harm you or is he feeling betrayed and can’t find the words to communicate his feelings? The answers to those questions, among others, will be important when determining whether or not you should move forward with this relationship.You mentioned that he has his own therapist and you see one separately (but that you’re in between therapists at the moment). Couples counseling may or may not be helpful. In any event, the fact that you both are open to counseling is a very good sign.Once you find a new therapist, he or she can assist you in exploring whether or not this relationship is right for you. You’ll want to examine your main question of what role, if any, do you play in how he behaves. He seems to be reacting to your behavior. Therapy is the ideal place to examine the dynamics of your relationship.His seems to be displaying extreme passive aggressive behavior. Passive-aggressive people are in fact aggressive in their behavior. Giving someone the “cold shoulder” is a bold expression without ever saying a word.The other problem with this type of behavior is that you never know what exactly precedes their behavior. People describe this experience as “walking on egg shells.” That expression essentially means having to be hypervigilant about what can set them off. That’s a very stressful way to live. It is impossible to communicate with someone who shuts down. Your boyfriend does eventually “come back online” but it’s important that he develop the ability to prevent his going “off” to begin with.The purpose of dating is to see if the two of you are a match. It’s an opportunity to spend time with an individual, to gauge their reactions, and get a sense of whether you want to make a more permanent commitment. If you see behavior that is concerning, then it’s time to rethink whether you want to stay in this relationship.At this point in time, it seems prudent to find a therapist and seriously examine whether or not this relationship is right for you. You need more information before deciding and a good therapist will be able to assist you in that process. Good luck with your decision. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 I have so many problems, where to start?? Okay so I will try to explain my situation as best as I could. I have never dated a man who didn’t lie or cheat or do something else bad to me. So I stopped dating for about 2 years. I met this guy and I am totally in love with him. He’s been hurt too just like me so from the start he wanted to take things slow. Okay cool. But I guess I’ve been hurt so badly,I’m taking everything out on him,which I know is not fair. He’s broken up with me on numerous ocassions because he can’t handle my always acussing him of things I have. No proof of him doing. I always beg and beg until he takes me back. I’ve lied to him and cheated twice. He knows that I talked to somebody but does not know that I actually slept with two other men.<|im_end|>

 You have anger issues and insecurities. The most efficient way to deal with these issues is to consult a therapist. If therapy is not an option, then you may want to consult self-help books or materials.Having anger issues and insecurities may explain why you repeatedly find yourself in unhealthy relationships and it may effectively explain your current behavior. You are engaging in the very behavior that has hurt you in past relationships. Cheating not only destroys relationships, it is emotionally and psychologically damaging to your partner. It is never okay to hurt someone you care about. A more effective approach would have been to have a discussion with your partner. If that did not decrease your fears, then consulting a therapist or an outside objective party would have been in order.What you cannot do is to allow the pattern of cheating and self-sabotage to continue. I would highly recommend seeing a therapist for your ongoing relationship issues. You are having difficulty sustaining healthy relationships. Your behavior in your current relationship is self-sabotaging. It is not healthy. It hurts you and your partner, it has seriously damaged this relationship and if is not corrected it will damage future relationships. You should not continue on this path. It is important that you correct these issues. Click the find help tab at the top of this page to help you locate a therapist. I wish you well. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I have battled with my idiosyncrasies since I was a little girl. I always thought I was merely particular, maybe slightly obsessive. However, after having a child my “sensitivities” if you will, have become markedly more intense. My skin has always been hypersensitive. In fact, I cut my hair multiple times, not bc I’m Daring as I let people believe, but because the individual hairs touching my skin drive me up a wall. Almost to the point of anger. Certain sounds make me want to curl up in a ball or scream. I don’t want this sort of thing influencing the way my child learns to cope with emotions. I have certain ways every little thing needs to be done and I feel like the world is ending when those systems are disrupted. A way of organizing the cabinets, a way of organizing the fridge, a way to load the dishwasher. I have panic attacks when I think about all of the things that are out of order while having a child and it exhausts me. I am severely socially apprehensive although I can mask it. I grew up with many siblings in a very abusive household and had to develop qualities that could help me protect my siblings and form lifelines outside of our home. I struggle every day to leave the house and go to a noisy bar and talk to people all night.<|im_end|>

Thank you for bringing us your concern. It would not be possible for me to make an accurate diagnosis, but it seems more likely that social anxiety is the concern. You may want to read about the topic from the Psych Central’s Steve Bressert here.

From a teen in Florida: I feel as though nobody believes in me or my relationship. Nothing I ever do is good enough for my parents and I’ve missed so much of my life just to get their approval, and I’ve gotten the exact opposite!<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Parents and kids usually have difficulty during the teen years. The teen is struggling to develop their own identity and to separate from their parents. Their parents want them to be independent but worry that they won’t be safe. The result is a push and pull that is very hard on everyone.The best way through it is honest communication. It’s just possible that your parents have some legitimate concerns. You won’t know if you aren’t open to hearing what they have to say. It’s equally possible that this guy is a fine person for you to be with. They won’t know if they won’t listen to what you have to say.I suggest you back up and show just how mature you are. Instead of arguing about the relationship, do your best to have a conversation with your parents about how you are all going to navigate the next few years together. You need to have some freedom to make your own decisions and to make your own mistakes. They need to know that you understand how to keep yourself safe. Do your best to stay calm and not to be defensive. Understand that their “disapproval” is most likely an attempt to keep you safe, not an unreasonable attempt to control your life.Meanwhile, do everything you can to demonstrate to your folks that you are a responsible person who makes good decisions. Do well in school. Choose good friends who are good to each other. Do your responsibilities at home with a smile. You may well find out that your parents will start to relax if they see you maturing and taking responsibilities seriously.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 Hurt people often want to hurt people. This is not at all unusual. When children have been traumatized, as you were, it is very important to get them psychological treatment so that they have a way to process their hurt and anger.Apparently, you haven’t had treatment. Please don’t be ashamed that you need it. Of course you do. You were hurt and you are feeling helpless to do anything about it. You are therefore left with your fantasies of a kind of revenge. Sadly, those fantasies are going to make it hard for you to trust other people or to be in loving relationships.At 19, you are an adult. Although I do think you should involve your parents if you have a good relationship with them, you don’t need to. Talk to your doctor or spiritual leader or someone else you trust about how to find a therapist who specializes in the after effects of trauma on children and teens. Then make an appointment.You shouldn’t have to live with this tension and unresolved feelings. Please contact a therapist and give yourself a chance to heal.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From a teen in the U.S.: Me and my mom has been fighting for a while now and we’e both tired of fighting with each. She is constantly saying I’m irresponsible and she makes me feel like I’m always doing something wrong. I try to tell her how I feel but she never listens to what I have to say. And I just recently found out that I may possibly have bulimia and I haven’t told her because she’s only going to “it’s all in your head, you don’t know what you’re talking about” so I always feels as though I can’t talk to her or tell her anything.<|im_end|>

The teen years are very, very difficult for most parents and kids. But you and your mom have an unusually serious communication problem. It looks to me like the two of you are resorting to ways of “fighting” that are hurting you both. She is resorting to dismissing your concerns and threats. You are resorting to an eating disorder and blaming her for it.I do think you love each other. It’s not that your mom doesn’t care about you. She is frantic about your grades. People who don’t care, don’t bother to fight. As for you: You do care what she thinks. And you are stressed out by the fighting.The good news is that you both want the fighting to stop. I’m thinking if the two of you could solve the problem, you would have done so already. For that reason, I do think a few sessions with a family therapist would be very helpful. A family therapist can give you a safe place to talk about your worries and can help you learn new ways to talk to each other. Your school guidance counselor or your doctor can help you find a counselor who works well with mother-daughter issues.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My husband and I are trying to have a baby right now, and it isn’t working. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this, since I don’t want friends and family to know what I’m thinking, and I don’t want them to know I’m a failure… I don’t want them to know that we want a baby b/c then I’ll get their pity or sympathy, or worse, we’ll just be the talk of the family when we’re not around. we’ve been trying for a while, and nothing is happening, with no explanation, since we’re both healthy…i am almost 30, so I don’t have much more time. i was having a hard enough time coping with that, when a week ago, my younger brother-in-law and wife announced that they are pregnant. They JUST got married 7 weeks ago, and are 7 weeks pregnant. Here’s my issues:<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It seems that you have turned having a baby into a competition. If we questioned your sister-in-law, in all likelihood, she would not support the idea that she is in a competition to have the first child. You’re also assuming that the second baby will not be as welcomed into the family or as loved as the first. Cognitively, this is a mistake in logic. What are you basing this assumption on? Why would parents or grandparents love the first child more than the second? Millions of parents and grandparents would tell you that they love all of their children and grandchildren equally, regardless of the order that they were born in.Following your logic, baby number two in your family is going to be the “lesser” loved of the two children. What if it were your in-laws who were to have the second baby? Shouldn’t you be upset about the fact that a child, in this case child number two, would be less loved? Isn’t this unfair to the second child? Wouldn’t you want all children to be loved and treated equally?In all likelihood, if there are multiple children in the family, no matter their birth order, your family would love all children equally.One interesting aspect of this situation is that your husband doesn’t feel the same way about his brother. You say he is “over trusting” but is he? Perhaps you are not trusting enough. He sees this situation differently than you but that does not mean he is wrong. In all likelihood, he realizes that his brother and the rest of the family would love all of the children equally, regardless of birth order.If you continue to struggle with this issue then I would suggest that you consider cognitive therapy. Cognitive therapy focuses on ideas about a particular situation and helps an individual to think in a logical manner. Very often people with mental health symptoms such as depression or anxiety or other related disorders are not thinking correctly. Cognitive therapy can help correct their thinking.Being cognitively wrong can have a snowball effect. If you’re wrong about one thing and then you use that incorrect thinking to draw a conclusion it may lead to mistakes in judgment and behavior. The incorrect assumption you are making in your situation is that the firstborn grandchild gets the most love. This is leading you to a host of incorrect conclusions. These conclusions and the thoughts associated with them are causing you to feel jealousy, anxiety, anger and so forth, to the point of kicking things and crying yourself to sleep every night. You’re not in a healthy place psychologically and that’s why you may want to consider therapy. You can change your thinking and overcome this issue but you may need the assistance of a mental health professional. It could be very helpful to you.I know that you are feeling very bad about this whole situation. I sincerely hope that soon you will feel better. Having a baby should be a thing of pure joy for you and should not be mixed with all of the negative feelings that you are experiencing. Counseling should help to remove those negative feelings and allow you to experience the pure joy that you deserve.If you’d like to find a therapist in your area please consult this directory.

 What you are describing is a sexual fetish. Sadomasochism or BDSM has long been studied by psychology. Both Freud and Jung have elaborate theories to explain this sexual fetish. Most theorists since then also have had their theories of this sexual fetish. Generally, we need to assess the effect of the fetish on the life of the individual. In other words, is the sexual fetish causing problems in the life of the individual? In your case, you are experiencing guilt and this is a problem.Many people include this particular sexual fetish in their normal sexual lifestyle and it has no negative effect upon the rest of their lives. Your fiancé may share your interest but you will not know this if you do not talk with her about it. From your letter, it appears to me that you may be ashamed of your fantasies and thus would not want to reveal them to your fiancé. Many people have sadomasochistic fantasies and many of them incorporate these fantasies into their sex life.If your fiancé had these fantasies and you did not, would you think less of her? If you think that these fantasies are bad and unacceptable, then it creates a dilemma because you are enjoying viewing them on the Internet.A therapist could help you to stop viewing these materials or they could help to remove the guilt that you feel after viewing the materials. I can tell you that your sexual interest in this fetish is fairly commonly found in the world’s population. I cannot tell you that you should accept these feelings as normal, if you find them to be unacceptable. If you feel that your fantasies are inappropriate, then through your own efforts or with the help of a therapist, you should stop viewing this fetish on the Internet.I would highly recommend that you discuss this with a therapist. I wish you the best of luck.<|im_end|>"

I have over the last few days been having voices in my head commenting on my thoughts and small events in my life, tell me I’m going to be ok, etc.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You said that you have been diagnosed with anxiety disorders. The voices you described are generally consistent with those disorders and not with a psychotic disorder. People with psychotic disorders hear voices that are not their own. The voices might be your conscious mind trying to calm you when your stress level is high. That is a plausible explanation.It’s also common for some people with anxiety disorders to believe that they are developing other, more serious ailments. People who are preoccupied with the idea of having a serious illness might have a diagnosable anxiety disorder called, as of the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), illness anxiety disorder.The fact that you continue to have symptoms might be attributable to only going to therapy every month and a half. That’s an unusually long time between sessions. You could benefit from more frequent sessions.Part of why you only go to therapy every six weeks might stem from your not trusting your therapist. You don’t tell her “big things” and therefore, it’s going to be difficult for her to help you. If you were honest with her about everything that is wrong, she could help you more effectively which, in all likelihood, would build trust in the relationship. She can only work with the information that you provide to her. Withholding information about your life hinders her ability to help you and therefore limits your progress. You might have more success in therapy if you were more honest.The probability of your having schizophrenia, because your mother has it, is only slightly higher than if you did not have a family member with schizophrenia. In addition, you did not say how old your mother is but you did indicate that she developed schizophrenia only three years ago. It seems that she developed it much later in life than the norm. It’s unusual to develop schizophrenia over the age of 40. It does happen, but it’s unusual.I would encourage you to report your concerns to your therapist and to increase the frequency of your therapy sessions. It might help to reduce your fears and help you to overcome these problems. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

For years I stayed with my ex husband through his lying, cheating, and abuse. Emotional and physical. Until I had finally left him. Now in a relationship with my current significant other and am having an externally hard time. Him even working sends me into anger and panic attacks. When we have fights (like most couples do) it doesn’t matter how small or insignificant it may be I get extremely angry. I have recently hit and bit myself in anger while upset. And have even slapped or pushed him. Afterward I regret it and am extremely upset that I could do such a thing to him. And go into panic attacks where I have to lay and rock back and forth and take deeps breaths to even have the ability to breath. This is not who I am and it is extremely upsetting to me, the anger and panic seems to only arise with him. what can I do to help resolve this problem.<|im_end|>

 You should seek professional help immediately. All of your issues are treatable with therapy and medication. Anger, panic and trust issues are common reasons for entering therapy. Medication can “take the edge off” while developing healthy coping skills in therapy. Many people have found that a combination of medication and therapy have significantly improved their overall quality of life.You have admitted to physically abusing your new partner. This is often an attempt to gain control in the relationship, to gain the safer “upper hand.” It is not a conscious, well-thought-out behavior. It is an unconscious, learned behavior.It was unacceptable for your ex to abuse you and it’s unacceptable for you to engage in that same behavior with your new partner. As you know from firsthand experience, abuse is detrimental physically and psychologically to a person’s well-being. It’s simply wrong.If you continue to abuse your partner, and refuse to seek help, then your partner will likely end the relationship. If you’re serious about changing your behavior, then you should seek professional help. It’s the most responsible course of action. It will show that you’re serious about change. I would strongly encourage you to deal with this issue. It is a way to finally end the abuse of your ex-husband. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I am only 20 and I’ve had stretch marks since I hit puberty. I was chubby when I was younger and I didn’t eat right. I think that’s the reason why I got stretch marks all over my body. Literally everywhere. On my arms, my breasts, my hips my thighs and knees and behind my calves. Some people think it’s over reacting, but I developed many issues because of my stretch marks. I love my body the way it is now and I know I worked hard to get here.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 A:  Please allow me to be very direct. Your problem is not your stretch marks, it is self-hatred. We all have flaws, both inside and out. Some folks hate their nose, some might not like the way they laugh, some people have lost a limb or breast to an accident or illness, some people suffer from mental illness, and some folks have stretch marks. My point is that none of us are perfect. Almost everyone I have ever met, both clinically and personally, has no problem coming up with a list of things they would like to change about themselves.What matters in terms of self-esteem, is also being able to list the things we like about ourselves and developing the ability to put more weight on those things. Have you ever heard the story of a Cherokee legend in which an elder is teaching his grandson about the struggle between good and evil inside us all?  He uses an analogy of a good white wolf and a bad black wolf and basically states that the one we feed is the one that will live. Here’s a link to another interesting interpretation, stating that we need to accept both (or all) parts of ourselves.http://www.awakin.org/read/view.php?tid=927My point is that you can spend the rest of your life focusing on the parts of yourself that you don’t like, or you can spend your time focusing on what you do like. And as corny as it sounds I believe in the sage advice that “in order for someone else to love us, we must first learn to love ourself.”You have allowed this issues to have way too much power in your life for too long. You blame your stretch marks for your depression, self-harm behaviors, substance abuse issues, unemployment, and social isolation. You don’t mention if you have ever sought professional help for any of these issues. If you haven’t, it is time. If you have and haven’t gotten the results you wanted, then I’d suggest finding a different therapist and/or psychiatrist who specializes in body image issues and depression. If you are still suicidal, please call a Crisis Hotline or go to the emergency room for evaluation. The issues you mention are serious and should not be taken lightly. Please get help now.All the best,<|im_end|>"

From a 19-year-old woman in S. Africa: Recently I got out of a 4-year drug influenced relationship but the feelings I had for him faded away after about a year but he kept me caged in because of the drugs, I was his money bank. But after we broke up and me getting clean of off the heroin, I started getting back into reality and my past slapped me through my face harder then ever, I went through a rough time when I was 13, things happened and I got pregnant then my mom made me have an abortion. And then when I was about 15 I met my father for the first time only realizing he is an alcoholic that meets his daughter drunk for the first time, treating me like his girlfriend. Luckily I reconnected a month after me and the druggy broke up,with an ex I had when I was 14 and it was like we picked up where we left off and he also helped a lot. Everybody said I’m moving on to fast but it felt like I was single for 3 years anyway.<|im_end|>

 At 19, you’ve had more sad, unfair, and traumatic experiences than people many times your age. It’s not at all surprising that your self-esteem is low and that you are so insecure. Your friends are right. You are not in any shape to make a strong positive relationship with anyone. You first need to make a strong positive relationship with yourself. That means getting some therapy to help you recover from all the trauma and to recover the self you are meant to be.You do have a core of strength. You broke up with a very bad boyfriend. You got clean. You are still willing to try for love. That’s actually pretty amazing. Give yourself lots of credit for that!You may feel old and weary but you are only 19. You have plenty of time to find a partner and to make the kind of relationship you want and deserve. But if you want to do that in a healthy way, and if you want to feel good about yourself, you need to do your personal work. Please continue to take care of yourself by finding a therapist.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 Whatever the diagnosis, you are certainly in great distress. As you’ve already discovered, avoiding the issue is only making it worse. Since you do have family, is there anyone you trust enough to help you? Often someone who is afraid on their own can lean on a trusted family member or friend. The support person can make the phone call and accompany you to your appointments and wait for you until your appointment is over.You might also find it helpful to read a couple of books about anxiety disorders. “Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy” by David Burns and “The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook” by Edmund Bourne are two that have helped many of my clients. You might also benefit by joining one of the forums here on PsychCentral.Please take some steps to help yourself. This isn’t going to get better on its own. You deserve to have a less stressed life.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I hate every word I say, every thought I have, what I look like, what my name is, how I eat, how I sleep, how I breathe, how I smoke cigarettes, the way I interact with people, everything. I am embarrassed by every single thing I do, I am so weird. I’ve been told by a lot of people that I have strange mannerisms and weird ways of saying things, I know it isn’t just me who sees how embarrassing I am. I am alone right now and I am still embarrassed, so I know it isn’t solely another-people problem. I just can’t, literally can’t socialize or get a job or move ahead in my life or even make one single friend because I am the most embarrassing thing on Earth. I’m diagnosed with PTSD and Major Depression and Depersonalization/Derealization disorder, but this feeling is worse than all of it because it follows me around EVERYWHERE, no matter how hard I try I fail miserably at everything. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.<|im_end|>

 Depression is likely a major contributor to how you feel. The two other disorders you mentioned are likely contributing as well. There’s no indication in your letter that you are in treatment or have ever been. Lack of treatment could be the problem.You wrote that other people think negatively of you. That may not be true. You might be misinterpreting their feedback.Also consider that your negative self-opinion likely influences how you interact with people. You might inadvertently be training them to treat you a certain way. For instance, if you make self-deprecating comments, in their presence, they might simply be agreeing with you and not really believe what they are saying. If you said good things about yourself, they might also agree just to be socially agreeable.The solution to this problem is counseling and possibly medication. Once your symptoms have improved, your negative self-beliefs will be replaced with more reasonable and realistic views of yourself and the world. Change your thinking and you can change your life. I hope you will give counseling a try. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I’ve recently reconnected with a man that was one of my best friends since elementary school. He and I have floated in and out of each others lives since we were young and though we’ve tried very hard to remain just friends, there’s always been these other feelings between us. My family knows him very well and they absolutely adore him, as is the same way between me and his family. He’s in the military and deploys about every other year for 12 months at a time, and though we’ve discussed a relationship between us, he feels like it’s unfair to me to leave me alone for such a long time, not to mention the fact that when he’s stationed stateside its across the country from my home now.<|im_end|>

 It would be highly unfair to Guy B and his little boy for you to talk about making a future with them when you still have a piece of your heart over with Guy A. You are essentially having an emotional affair with Guy A. He’s your “if only” guy. He’s the guy you are holding onto in the belief that things would be better if only . . . You may be right. You may not. But as long as you think that just maybe the two of you are meant for each other, you are not going to be able to fully commit to Guy B.Only you can decide if you can forgive Guy B enough to truly start over and give the relationship a real chance. Only you can decide if you are genuinely ready to commit to a commitment with him and completely stop thinking about the possibilities with your childhood friend.

 It is difficult to know what may be wrong. What you might be describing are symptoms of anxiety or of panic attacks. Unfortunately, I do not have enough details to make that determination. I would recommend being evaluated by a therapist. He or she can gather much more information about your situation.When dealing with anxiety, it is important to be as logical and as rational as possible. The key to curing anxiety is to force yourself to believe in reality at all times. Often, anxiety symptoms stem from an inability to see reality clearly. Individuals with anxiety have lost the capacity to do this effectively. This is a situation in which a therapist could be helpful. A therapist is an objective third party who is also trained to deal with anxiety and other related mental health problems. Anxiety medication or antidepressant medication may also provide you relief. The “find help” tab at the top of this page can help you locate a therapist in your community. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Is lifetime depression a thing? Is there some other medical explanation? I’ve had my thyroid tested which has once turned out to be ‘hypo’ I believe. But only when I fasted. I just feel like I’ve never been happy. Bullied at a young age. Very smart. Reasonably good looking. Flaky, constantly loosing things, messy, can’t get my stuff together. Heavy under achiever. I’m not lazy I try and work hard. I’m trying to quit drinking. Been a functional alcoholic for probably 10 years or more. I’ve stepped it down to a couple beers a day over the last week. I just don’t know if I will ever get myself together and be happy. I always try and be happy and kind to other people. I pick terrible relationships because I tend to see the best in people. I’m always somewhat anxious. My mind never stops it’s relentless. I try to stay optimistic. But really, I have had very few moments in my life where I’m actually happy. My mother’s agoraphobic. I don’t want to end up like her. And I don’t want to live on pills for the rest of my life that make me feel not like me. I’m just so tired of being miserable, and anxious, and scatterbrained. Do people really go a day where they can compartmentalize what’s going on in their brain long enough to be happy? Without drowning themselves in a bottle of tequila (which doesn’t really work either). This is a problem I’ve had since childhood. Is it always this much of a struggle for everyone. Just to do the dishes!!! Like why can’t I function? It can’t be easy for anyone. But it can’t be this bloody hard for everyone. What’s wrong with me?? (From Canada)<|im_end|>

 The most obvious thing in your email is the fact that you are drinking everyday for the past 10 years — and are asking why you are depressed. Almost all of the things that you are mentioning, being scattered, underachieving, anxious, etc., are in some way tied to alcoholism or abuse. Why not deal directly with the core issue. Nothing, no form of therapy or medicine, is going to help if you don’t deal with the drinking. Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant. If you are taking it in everyday, you are not giving yourself a chance.My strong recommendation is to use one of the most effective programs known to cope. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is available in your area. Go to a few open meeting and see what they have to offer. If you want to get a handle on being happy — start with untangling the thing that is holding you back the most.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

My friend has been making bad decisions lately. She lost her job because of an ex-boyfriend she went back with, they broke up I don’t know how many times, she stopped seeing him finally a few months ago but she was also seeing another ex-boyfriend, both CHOSE to leave her without saying anything in the past which is why they broke up. She’s been on and off with this second guy. She’s been making progress in putting her life back together by going back to school but this guy is getting in the way. She told him to leave –he comes back and this repeats. A few days she went back to him after telling him to leave her alone once more because he was always at her place keeping her from her school work. I’m getting mad, because I don’t know how many times I spent the night consoling her because of these guys. Now she went back to him and it’s gonna be the same thing and don’t know what to say to her. I don’t agree with the relationship, her friends have told me the same also, but I don’t want to upset her. I’ve had enough of this back and forth. Every time she ends it he keeps going to her place, bangs on her door demanding to talk to her and she eventually caves. She told him to leave again and he told her to kill herself and said her kids don’t like her. Days later he demands to see her, she caves and the cycle repeats. I’m disappointed in her because the last time I spoke to her she hasn’t been to class and told me hasn’t done homework in a week because he’s there. Some of her friends have told me they’ve given up on her. I don’t want to do that but I’m close. We haven’t spoken since they got back together, one I don’t know what to say, two I feel like he’s controlling her. I want to be there for her but it’s just gonna be the same thing over and over. I’m at a loss, she’s gonna ruin her life again for an ex. (From the USA)<|im_end|>

As a friend, you’re in a powerful position to help, but the kind of help may be different than what you’re thinking. It’s time to have a heart to heart talk with your friend and explain that watching her do self-defeating things is taking a toll on you. Let her know that as much as you care about her, and that her behavior is starting to affect you emotionally. This is a very common phenomenon. She is doing to you what is happening to her. Let me repeat and amplify that. She is doing to you what is happening to her by going to you for support and then goes away and the cycle repeats. She’s distracted and overwhelmed by the relationship and is losing herself and feeling frustrated. The same is happening to you. You were feeling frustrated and overwhelmed at her antics and it has become so much of a distraction for you that you’re not taking as good care of yourself as you should. You are in parallel with her and it is very hard to spot it when you are in it.Let her know how much you care about her as a friend, but then let her know you can continually be there for her watching her do self-defeating things because it’s not healthy for you. My hope is that this honest conversation lets her realize that unless she starts making better decisions for herself you can’t let yourself get pulled down. This is EXACTLY what you want for her. What you’d be doing is role modeling what she needs to do. By setting a limit on how much energy and frustration you’ll put into this relationship you’re giving her the role model for what she needs to do with these boyfriends.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: Sometime before I was five, my dad left my mom and my mom passed me off on my grandparents. Since I was a child, my grandpa always screamed at me, beat me and told me how I’d always be a loser, a nobody, a ditch digger in prison and a druggie like my dad. I still see his face yelling those things to me till this day.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You are right. You haven’t lived. Your grandfather is still in control of your life because you haven’t found a way to metabolize the traumatic experiences of your childhood. It sounds to me like you internalized his messages to the point that you have no confidence or even respect for yourself. I want you to know that this is not an unusual reaction to being traumatized repeatedly. All the symptoms you described, including the emotional dreams, are consistent with a diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).As you already do know, you can’t drink or drug this away. Isolating yourself doesn’t get the pain out. In fact, it only helps to lock it up inside you. You need therapy from a therapist who has experience working with repeated trauma. As frightening as it may seem to dig deeply into your issues and talk about them, I don’t think it will be any more painful than what you’ve been doing. Further, the pain of going through it is what will get it out. You will then be helped to build your severely damaged self-esteem as well as your coping skills for managing stress.With some changes toward a more healthy way of living and therapy to change your self-esteem, you have every reason to believe you have a good 50 or more years of life to live. With a real effort in therapy, you can look forward to having a successful life that includes good friends, good work and perhaps a good partner. I hope you will find the courage to do your therapeutic work. You deserve it.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I began nursing school in 1983 and got near completing it – to the final year. Although my grades had always been superior emotionally I was a wreck and had to drop out. However, I DID discover at this time I had hyperthyroidism, and believed that had much to do with my stress over the last part of nursing ed. I had to stop, have treatments of various sorts for that condition, and it has since been under good control.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Thank you both for writing. To help keep this answer straight, I’m going to call the nursing student “NS” and the pastor’s wife “PW.” The problem might have something to do with early abuse but in NS’s case there is a huge mitigating factor. NS was well loved by her bio-mom who so much wanted the best for her that she encouraged the relationship with the pastor’s family. She has also been loved and supported by PW who gave her what her own mom couldn’t. One possibility is that there just may be some loyalty issues at play here for NS since PW is a nurse. Does becoming a nurse feel to NS like some final betrayal of her mother?If NS were seeing me, I’d ask her to imagine that we had some magic and all the obstacles had been cleared away and that she has become a nurse. How would things then change? What would she expect of herself? How would her relationships with important people in her life change? What does she imagine others now expect of her? Often imagining a positive outcome will highlight the fears. Then we would address those fears directly.I do think PW is correct: NS needs a counselor to help her identify what is blocking an otherwise smart and motivated woman. At 47, I imagine that NS is really sick of this and wants to get on with a career she has been working toward for so many years. I can’t suggest a counselor but NS’s primary care physician would be able to help her know who to call. Someone in the PC community who comes from the same area might also have suggestions. I do have a bias that a therapist who is close in age to NS would have a more intuitive understanding of what it means to be getting older and to be feeling that it may be “now or never” to go for her goals.I wish you well, <|im_end|>"

From roughly the age of 9 I have had an extremely volatile relationship with my mother. From the outside looking in, she is a very law-abiding pilar of the community. Very pleasant to speak to within certain audiences, her family, our friends etc but when we are alone she is almost like a completely different person. As though her problems manifest into those few moments (I limit time alone with her now) and she lets it all out. How terrible her life and usually how myself and my father are to blame. I used to feel sorry for my father but now as an adult with my own children, I feel a sense of anger as to why he has allowed this to go on or was it that he doesn’t see the full extent of the emotional abuse. One time I remember as a child she was in one of her moods so I put my headphones in as a coping mechanism. We were in town and she grabs them out of my ears and told me to get lost (in polite terms) and I walked to my grandmother’s house which was around 4 miles away alone. My father came to collect me and I got told off as he did not believe it was my mother who told me to do this and I suppose that had a lasting impact as since then I don’t believe he trusts me as an innocent party.<|im_end|>

It is time to make the break from your mother. She isn’t as interested in your well-being as she is in control. Taking the job, finding good childcare, and getting out from under her control should be your priority. Where your children get childcare is for you and your husband to decide. If she won’t see your children at all if you don’t do it her way, then this will be her loss.If you are worried about the degree to which you may be struggling emotionally it would always be acceptable to go for a psychological evaluation by a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist. But the situation you are describing here is a matter of of your mother believing she can threaten you by not caring for her grandchildren. You and your husband need to do what is best for you and you family — not what will appease your mother.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

He doesn’t care about his school life, lately he ask weird question comparing for his ages about what are the things around him. He played game online sometime, don’t talk much, in his actions he is a bit delayed. And what i worry the most is that he act sometimes like the older brother with his gestures. He walk like him, the position of hands make often like him and some nonsense world that my older brother often say the little one is saying. We all thought before that my little brother with time would be better but I’m worried that he is going to be more bad…And i forgot to tell that we have send my little brother at doctor before but they said that he doesn’t have anything in his mind or in heart like my brother. We are five children. Three girls and two boys and my sisters are so well and very smart and the illness that my older brother have isn’t inherited. Could someone tell me what should I do about my little brother? I don’t want he to be or to act like older brother?

Unfortunately, without more information and an in-person interview, I have no way of knowing what might be wrong with your brother.Your family might try having a second or a third evaluation.

From the U.S.: I’m 8 months pregnant and my boyfriend has confessed to cheating on me. Its been going on for at least 4 months. I have agreed to take him back and forgive but now he says he doesn’t believe I want to be with him. He thinks I just don’t want the other woman to have him – who by the way is in a relationship. I asked him if the tables were turned would he take me back. He said no, he would leave. My question is should I even pursue this relationship especially when he wouldn’t fight for me. I have gone into a state of depression over this. I’ve lost so much weight which isnt good for my unborn.<|im_end|>

 I’m so glad you wrote. Right now, the top priority is taking care of yourself and your baby. You need to find out whether your boyfriend is going to help you make a family or not. If he’s not, you need to be preparing yourself for single motherhood. That means figuring out how you will support the two of you financially, and how you are going to get the help you need so you can go to work or school.Your boyfriend has withdrawn from you and the baby, but he’s cheated with a woman who isn’t really available to him. Further, your boyfriend doesn’t believe you because he knows he would not be as forgiving if he were in your shoes. I’d say he is a mixed up guy. I wonder if he has been acting out because he is afraid of the responsibilities that come with fatherhood.It’s long past time to have a very difficult and long talk with him about what it means to him to be a father. Ask him directly if he is scared. Share your own fears. Remind him that whether or not the two of you love each other enough to marry, you both still have responsibilities to the baby. Is he willing to make an effort to be your partner as well as a parent? What specifically is he planning to do as his part in raising his child?Until you have such a talk, you don’t have the information you need to decide whether he is worth giving another chance. You two may be able to work it out. But it will take honesty and forgiveness and commitment and love to do it.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hey, I’ve got a pretty complex issue here with a lot of nuances. To put it simply, my girlfriend has BPD with the three extra disorders, Eating, Depression, and anxiety. After 9 months I’m really struggling to find the love in the relationship. One month ago I did something awful to her that was related with my PTSD, and now I’m just trying to pick up the pieces because of guilt. Because of my desperate behaviors, I’m worried that she has taken this opportunity to control me. Currently, there is a lot of me giving to her and not receiving the same effort back. There are a lot of fights and daily depression that effects both our lives heavily. I guess, I’m trying to figure out if I should break up with her because the BPD has become too overwhelming and manipulative. I can’t even play guitar anymore because she thinks that me learning will compromise her identity that has latched onto her guitar skills. All of my hobbies are now competitions in her mind. I love her extremely, but all of this daily drama is killing us. I think it just comes down to figuring out if there is a future for us anymore. Can we recover from my PTSD episode that ruined our relationship, or are we just delusional. I really don’t have anyone in my life to discuss with. (From the USA)<|im_end|>

  Whatever this is it isn’t love. You said it yourself. After 9 months you are feeling guilty, controlled, and your growth and hobbies are in competition with her. You are most likely in love with who you wish she could be-not who she is. Nine months is enough.Learn from this experience and move on. You can use our forums if you need support and are not in a position for therapy.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From Canada: I get upset and/or hurt way too easily by other people, and often over trivial things. There are times when I would simply retire from the situation, ruminate and then feel fine. But there are also times when I would get irrationally angry, and in those moments I also become really mean and hurtful.<|im_end|>

 Thank you for writing. The fist step toward making change is recognizing that change is needed. You’ve made that step. Give yourself credit for that.The next step is taking charge of your anger. Your anger doesn’t “take over”. You decide to throw it at someone. Your sister makes the choice to stop instead of being hurtful. You have the power to make the same choice.As for why you are so angry: I can’t know based on a letter but I can make a couple of guesses. There’s an expression: “Hurt people hurt people.” People who have been hurt in the past sometimes try to prevent it from happening again by getting even — even before someone really hurts them. It’s kind of like saying “I’m going to get you back before you hurt me because I know you are going to do it”. Another guess is that you feel somehow inferior to many people and the only way you know to feel equal is to have the upper hand. Or maybe it is something else. Those are just guesses.As you are already finding, being so quick to be angry and hurtful doesn’t invite people to want to be around you.If you can’t get a hold on your anger by yourself, I do suggest you seek out a counselor for some self-understanding and for some anger management training. It is okay to feel anger when you find yourself in conflict with someone. It’s what you do next that either destroys relationships or brings people closer.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I’m sorry. I can’t give you a definitive answer on the basis of this information alone. Either is possible, including that you have both.Of more importance to me than the label is that you are so disconnected from people. People are social animals. We are wired to need and want to be with others for our emotional and physical health.Disconnection can be the consequence of biology, trauma, learning or a combination. Whatever the cause, continuing as you have been will send you down a path of a lifetime of loneliness and probably anger (that you may justify as indication of your superiority). For that reason, I hope you are getting therapy.You are only 17. However content you may feel with yourself, you also acknowledge that your feelings and behaviors are unusual; perhaps abnormal. There is great advantage in pursuing therapy now. Your brain is still developing. Your attitudes towards others are not locked in. You can set yourself down a different path.Your letter shows you to be intelligent and insightful. These are strong, positive assets for therapy. If you commit to taking it seriously, you will do well with it.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: Hi. This story has been in the making most of my life and seems a vicious circle that I cannot solve to both our liking & to my annoyance. All my life, I have felt mostly ignored & criticized by my mother. She came here from Europe at 21 after meeting my American father in Europe and marrying here. They were educated, but, I feel, “missed” the 60’s revolution and both seemed a little “square.” They also seemed to have learned much, but I always felt a little deprived for some reason.<|im_end|>

 I don’t have enough information to make sense of how your mother treats you. It’s always sad to me when a parent isn’t able to show love and support to all of her or his children. There may be a secret that influences her behavior. She may have not wanted to have a child so young. She may see something in you that reminds her of someone who gave her pain in the past. She may not even know what it is that puts her on edge with you.But regardless of the reason, you have suffered about this far too long. You are 53. You have done your best to connect with your mother in more positive ways. I think you can stop working so hard on the project at this point. Love her as best you can for who she is, and stop trying to change her or the relationship. The same for your relationship with your sister. Revisiting the old arguments only annoys them and disappoints you.Instead, focus your energy on finding and maintaining a group of friends who respect and care about each other and who enjoy spending time together. Such a group can be a family of your own creation. By all means, stay in touch with your biological family but draw your need for nurturing and being nurtured with good friends.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I’ve been with my boyfriend for 2 years and 7 months. Since we are getting close to our next 3 year anniversary, he told me he wanted to talk to my family because he wants to ask me to marry him. I love him so much and of course i want to marry him, but before that i want to confess him something. I was planning not to but it’s making me feel uneasy and terribly bad. I do want to tell him but i want to be sure if am doing the right thing and how should i tell him.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It speaks to your maturity and character that you want to start your marriage with a clean slate. I would hope that your boyfriend understand that there’s a difference between lying and keeping personal things private. Lies are meant to manipulate and deceive. Privacy is about self-protection and preserving some personal boundaries. I think the stories you’ve shared fall into the latter category.Let’s start with the easy one first: You ran up debt when you wee younger. You have been doing the honorable thing and are paying it off before you marry. You aren’t asking him to be burdened by it. It seems to me that this is your own business. If you choose to share it, I would hope that your boyfriend would see that not only did you learn your lesson about debt but that you have learned how to handle money so it won’t be a problem between you.The miscarriage does require a conversation. You didn’t lie. You don’t have children. But you didn’t tell the whole truth either and medical history could affect things in the future. It’s understandable that in the early stages of your relationship you wanted to keep such a personal thing private. As your intimacy with your boyfriend has increased, the boundaries between what is personal and what affects both of you has changed. I imagine you and your boyfriend will want children someday. Your doctor will want to know about prior pregnancies in order to give you the best care. In general, family members shouldn’t know things that your husband doesn’t.You are 30. I imagine both of you have done things in the past that you wish you hadn’t. People who have lived life and had experiences generally also have some regrets. Regardless, all of our experiences shape us into who we are as adults. We don’t get to pick and choose. I hope that you and your boyfriend will be able to talk about your histories with a focus on who you’ve become and your hopes for the future.I worry about your level of worry about such a conversation. If your boyfriend is so judgmental that he can’t be understanding and sympathetic when you talk about such issues, maybe you should rethink marrying him. Life is far too complicated to hold it against someone for being private about private matters.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I was wondering if it would be possible to let me know if i could have a personality disorder? I am 15 years old and a girl. Sometimes i have weeks where i will cry everyday, become angry and sometimes to the extent of hurting myself. Then i’ll have days where i am happy and it seems like everything is fine. I am very sensitive to critism, and even the smallest of things can upset me. I am a very shy person because i get very anxious, nervous and my heart will start beating really fast when talking to people i hardly know or dont know at all, which has recently become a problem and has affected school assignments where we have to do oral presentations. I have trouble staying focused sometimes.<|im_end|>

 While it is difficult to accurately give a diagnosis over the Internet, based on the information that you have provided, you do not seem to meet the criteria for a personality disorder. Sometimes individuals experience symptoms without matching a specific diagnosis. In other words, sometimes people have problems that do not fit a particular label. I think there are a number of issues that you are struggling with, including having difficulty managing your emotions, maladaptive coping skills, low self-esteem and anxiety. The good news is that all of these issues are curable and help is available.It was very wise of you to write to us to help determine if you have a problem. Now that we have identified a few possible issues the next important step is to speak to your parents. Your parents may be able to assist you in getting help with your problems. You want to speak to your parents sooner rather than later before your issues become overwhelming and less manageable. You need to let your parents know that there is a problem. They can’t help you if they don’t know a problem exists. If you are unwilling to speak your parents, then you need to speak to a guidance counselor, teacher, clergyman or whomever you feel comfortable sharing information with.In the meantime, plan ahead. For instance, we have identified the fact that you have difficulty managing your emotions. Put a plan in place for what to do when you become emotionally overwhelmed. Your plan should include identifying concrete strategies to manage or to remove yourself from difficult situations. My suggestions include:The idea is that you want to distract yourself from the emotionally charged situation as a way to prevent yourself from engaging in the maladaptive self-harm behavior. These methods might help temporarily until you are able to seek counseling.With regard to giving oral presentations, public speaking is the number one fear among the majority of people. You are not alone. The fear of public speaking is not a reason to think that there is something wrong. In fact, if you were not afraid of public speaking you would be in the minority. Learning to be comfortable as a public speaker is a process. It can take time to decrease or eliminate your fear but it is very possible. Please consider reading the answers I have written previously with regard to public speaking and how to decrease the anxiety it produces.I hope this answer helps. Please take care. I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

For as long as I can remember I identified as male and had no issues with the biological body I had (I was ashamed of it a little bit because I wasn’t in great shape but I didn’t think that having a female body would make me more confident). I also had a history of obsessive thoughts about relationships and homosexuality (might have OCD) and my thought about being transsexual started the same way – I had a sexual fantasy where I was a woman and went «oh my god am I trans?». But what I feel for a past couple of days looks like a gender dysphoria rather than OCD. Mainly my fantasies about being a woman are sexual but not 100%. I imagine myself having a female body, moving and acting like a woman and it feels so good. I feel like I want to have wide hips, breasts tiny little hands and beautiful legs of a girl rather than my male body. Those fantasies are so lucrative and pleasant its painful to wake up from them and realize that I am just a boring male.<|im_end|>

 Feelings pass and diminish in intensity. They can be short lived and have limited meaning. Did you ever experience a very strong feeling and a short time later no longer feel that way? Feelings, especially intense ones, aren’t reliable enough to serve as the foundation for sound judgments. Time and logic provides the opportunity to form more accurate judgments.It’s noteworthy that you have a history of obsessive thoughts which could indicate obsessive-compulsive disorder. Therefore, anxiety cannot be ruled out as the reason for your feelings. The nature of anxiety is irrational worry. Your intense feelings could be valid but just as easily could be invalid. Emotions are worthy of exploration but not necessarily action.It’s normal and healthy to explore questions of sexuality. You are getting to know yourself and thinking about what your preferences are, and so forth. These are normal emotional experiences but when it comes to major life decisions, you must be cautious. There are consequences for being wrong including unnecessary suffering. One should avoid such an outcome whenever possible. Counseling will help you to sort through your feelings and to understand them more thoroughly. I hope you will consider it. If so, choose a therapist who specializes in obsessive-compulsive disorder and gender and sexuality issues. They would be in the best position to help you. Good luck.<|im_end|>"

 I understand that you are suffering but trying to cause yourself to become deaf will not help you to escape from society’s norms. You may not have to hear about what society thinks but even without your hearing there still be many other ways in which the norms of society will be evident to you.What about reading? You have access to the Internet. The Internet has been called the information “super highway.” One only has to spend a short amount of time surfing the Internet to become aware of what is going on in the world. Undoubtedly through reading the Internet, or even a magazine or a newspaper you’d quickly become aware of what those in society are thinking.You use the phrase “society’s norms” and although I am not exactly sure what you mean by this expression I am taking it to mean that you feel pressured to conform to what society defines as “correct” behavior. I also presume that you are feeling extreme pressure to behave in a manner consistent with society’s norms and you resent feeling that you have to follow along with what society says.It’s healthy and open-minded to question the norms of society and it’s even good that you don’t feel compelled to follow them but to go beyond this and attempt to make yourself deaf is profoundly unhealthy. What you are doing will permanently damage your hearing. I can assure you that even if you accomplished your goal of causing yourself to become deaf that you will not have resolved the issue that has led you to want to eliminate your ability to hear, feeling pressured to conform to society.There are other ways to deal with your strong feelings regarding societal pressures. I would highly recommend that you see a mental health professional. He or she can help you find safer and more effective methods to deal with the pressure that you feel from society.He or she can also help you channel your strong feelings about societal pressures into other positive mechanisms for change. For instance, did you know that for centuries many philosophers and psychologists have written extensively about the subject of conformity and society’s norms? Why not consider reading or writing about the issue as a way to vent your frustrations rather than trying to harm yourself using methods that are sure to hinder you?See a therapist and tell him or her what you have been doing. Your friend is correct to be worried about you. What you are doing in extremely dangerous. Please consider getting help now.<|im_end|>"

From a 13 year old in the U.S.: The other day, my dad was cracking down on me for having 3 late assignments and made me stay up until midnight to finish them. After I completed them, I packed up my school things and went to my bedroom, passing through the kitchen. I did my usual nightly routine of grabbing a granola bar when I noticed that the knife set looked extremely friendly. I grabbed one and held it to my wrist, ready to add to my cut collection when Dad WOKE UP and CAME INTO THE KITCHEN! He grabbed the knife in anger, not in a concerned parent way, and yelled at me for being a stupid failure and that he wished that I could be like my younger sister. (My sister is an All-Star Basketball player for our school and has all As)<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I can’t answer that question. I can tell you that most teens go through times when they feel overwhelmed and unsure about how to handle life. Sadly, you have fallen on ways to manage your feelings that are dangerous or limiting. A “cut collection” tells me you have been self-harming for awhile. Your imaginary friend “Clover” does provide you with some comfort but does not help you learn how to find comfort with real people.Unfortunately, your dad doesn’t know how to handle his worry about you. When parents yell like that, it’s usually because they are feeling scared and helpless. Believe it or not, his yelling is an indication that he cares. It makes a kind of sense that he wants you to be like your sister. He doesn’t think he has to worry about her. (Though that may not be true.) But that is no comfort to you and it doesn’t help your relationship for him to say so.Your dad needs to learn productive and loving ways to help you. You need to learn ways to handle stress that aren’t so dangerous to your physical and mental health.My best suggestion is that you talk to your school guidance counselor or doctor about how to go about getting a family therapist for you and your dad. This isn’t about blaming anyone. It’s not about figuring out who is “crazy”. It’s about finding new ways to be together that keep you safe and feeling loved by the dad who loves you. When that happens, it’s possible that you will be able to drop your desire to cut or to keep up an imaginary companion. If not, your therapist will help you take the next steps to do so.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I have a way older sister that I am close to. We don’t live close, in fact, in different sides of the USA, but we are still kind of close to each other. We are close emotionally I mean, as sisters. Anyway, I have schizoaffective disorder and I have tried to talk to her about it. Although she doesn’t think I have it. We haven’t lived in the same house actually since she went off to college years ago before I got diagnosed. I got diagnosed at 17. We haven’t lived in the same house since I was 9, but we are still kind of close. We talk at least once a week a bit, sometimes more. I’ve become a lot more reclusive since I’ve been diagnosed and have kept and continue to keep things to myself.

Having information coming from a professional is often a better way for family members to learn and understand.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

You may be describing disassociation. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, in their fifth edition, (DSM-5), the book that mental health professionals consult when diagnosing mental health disorders, defines disassociation as “a disruption, interruption, and/or discontinuity of the normal, subjective integration of behavior, memory, identity, consciousness, motion, perception, body representation, and motor control.”In other words, disassociation involves feeling a certain level of disconnection with your mind or body. It often involves memory loss and losing track of time. Some people describe it as “getting lost,” “spacing out,” or — on the more extreme end — having an out of body-like experience.Transient or mild dissociative experiences have been described by nearly 1/3 of the population. In that sense, it is relatively common. Individuals who experience more severe forms of disassociation, may have a dissociative disorder. According to the DSM, there are five types of dissociative disorders. These include: 1) dissociative identity disorder; 2) dissociative amnesia; 3) depersonalization/derealization disorder; 4) other unspecified dissociative disorders; and 5) unspecified dissociative disorder.Generally speaking, disassociation is often commonly associated with trauma. This could include childhood sexual and or and physical abuse, childhood maltreatment and or neglect, adult rape, intimate partner violence, medical or other types of emotional traumas. This can also include survivors of wars and natural disasters, prisoners of wars (POWs), holocaust survivors, and other individuals who have been victims of painful experiences.The reasons why individuals experience disassociation may vary but much of the research centers on what is called the trauma model. This model suggests that individuals are experiencing these temporary bouts of amnesia as a way to protect themselves from traumatic or overwhelming experiences. They prevent an individual from becoming overwhelmed with the full impact of the trauma. In short, they are a psychological form of protection.Though trauma is psychological, there are physical components to it as well. Research indicates that some individuals experience a freezing type of protective response in dangerous situations. This is called tonic immobility (TI). Tonic immobility is a state of involuntary paralysis in which individuals cannot move or even speak. They are essentially temporarily paralyzed. Experiences of TI are common among individuals who have posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Not being able to physically move in the face of extreme danger can be quite a disconcerting experience. Some victims feel unnecessary guilt for their inability to remove themselves from dangerous situations. However, they should not feel that way since TI is not something that can be physically controlled or prevented. It is an involuntary mechanism that is thought to be triggered when an individual’s sensory inputs reach a critical level and they feel as though there is no escaping.You didn’t mention whether or not you have experienced a traumatic past. If I were interviewing you, I would be attempting to assess whether or not you have a trauma history. It would be wise to record your dissociative experiences and to consult a mental health professional who specializes in trauma. They can help you to definitively determine whether these experiences are disassociation. Depending upon how often your episodes occur and their severity, the clinician will likely recommend treatment. Treatment often involves individual psychotherapy and medication, if necessary. Some individuals have found hypnosis to be particularly helpful but whether or not it would be appropriate for you depends upon the nature and severity of this issue.I hope this answer assists you in knowing more about dissociation. Please consult a mental health professional, for in-person, individualized assistance. Good luck and please take care.<|im_end|>"

Well. Where do I start. I’m 16 and live in New Zealand. I know I have an anxiety disorder of some form. I also know I’m extremely likely to have depression. But sometimes I’m hyper, which is why I keep thinking I might have bipolar. My symptoms all up are panic attacks, lack of appetite, generally depressed and upset, really irregular sleep patterns, low self-esteem, self-harm (does that count as a symptom?), and sometimes I’m extremely over excited and hyper and can’t focus on anything. Being a teenager, could this be just because of that? I really don’t know if they’re moodswings from being my age or from bipolar. Absolutely nothing has happened in my life to make me this way. I have good parents, a comfortable life, I go to a good school with amazing friends.. yet I hate it all. At one stage I was in counselling, but it didn’t work out. I’d be prepared to go back if I was brave enough to ask my parents.. Please help, I need the advice.<|im_end|>

A; You’re right. At your age it’s hard to know if this is about adjusting to adolescence or if there is something more serious going on. Whichever it is, it’s important to take it seriously.The first step is to see your doctor. I’m concerned about the sleep disorder. If you aren’t getting a good solid 8 hours or more of sleep every night, that may be a major source of your problems. Fortunately, there are ways to help you get better sleep. Revising your routines and learning ways to relax can help a great deal. If you are still having difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep, your doctor might prescribe some medicine to help you get back into a reasonable rhythm.At 16, you may also be dealing with some hormonal shifts that are creating the ups and downs you describe. As with the sleep, your doctor is the place to start.If everything checks out medically, then I suggest you consider seeing a psychiatrist. Since your life is generally fine, it may be that you are having the mood swings that are symptoms of either an organic depression or bipolar disorder. In that case, some medicine coupled with some counseling to help you learn new ways to manage your feelings is the next step.You are fortunate to have supportive parents and friends. I’m sure you will get through whatever the trouble is if you get the consultations you need to identify the source of your distress.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My bf and I have been together for 1.5 years. He is 32. From the start of our relationship, you could tell that he didn’t have a sex drive. But after a while, I noticed that he wasn’t the initiator for making love. If we were to make love, I had to initiate or we wouldn’t have sex at all. There was one point we went 3 months without having sex because he wasn’t initiating and I was pissed off that I always had to initiate, so I stopped. Let me add, I’m not the most sex driven person either…I could go a week or two, but I am not used to being the one to initiate sexual contact and I also am not used to being turned down. This is a 1st for me, and I don’t know how to handle it. I’m used to the guys that are up your butt and the girl has to turn them down. I feel like I am the guy. Its come to the point that it is ruining our relationship and anything that is a little problem, turns into a bigger thing because the sex problem is taking precedence over everything else. I did find out however, that he has been like this for a long time. He is on Effexor, and I know that also decreases your sex drive, but even before the Effexor…he told me that he had a low sex drive.<|im_end|>

 Some couples I have worked with have found that setting aside one evening a week for romantic and sexual activities can help take the guesswork out of the encounter. While this reduces the spontaneity it increases the regularity. You may want to experiment with this approach.My experience has been that it is much better for couples to switch to alternate means of gratification other than intercourse. This doesn’t take away the problem of initiation, but it does shift an aspect of pleasuring each other sexually that may allow greater frequency. Along these lines, this gives you an opportunity to educate your boyfriend about your needs, while alternately giving him an opportunity to please you.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

  What you didn’t mention in the letter is whether you have a counselor. If not, you have been heroic long enough. You’ve been battling the effects of bullying, anxiety and an eating disorder on your own. That’s amazing! But at some point, most people who have had the experiences that you have had need a little help. There is no shame in that. Why should you be fighting the impulses to cut and the social anxiety all by yourself, when there are professionals who have made it their life work to help people deal with these issues?If you haven’t yet seen a counselor, do make an appointment right away. If you have been seeing a counselor, I hope you are seeing him or her regularly and that you are sharing the same information you did here. The road back from an eating disorder is a difficult one but it is not impossible. With support, you can also learn the coping skills and social skills you need to be more comfortable around other people.Please. Take care of yourself and get the help you need.

 I doubt very muich that your folks hate a guy they’ve never met. What they hate is that you aren’t handling the relationship in a responsible way. They see you spending hours on the phone when you should be getting much-needed sleep. They’re probably worried that you are over-involved with someone you haven’t known that long. Parents, being parents, are feeling protective of your health and your welfare. Sneaking out will only confirm their belief that you aren’t mature enough to handle a relationship.You and your guy need to talk about how to demonstrate to your parents that the two of you are able to respect reasonable boundaries around phone use. You two also need to show your parents that you are both responsible about your health and welfare. If your boyfriend cares for you, he will want to help you solve the problem instead of just agreeing that the situation “sucks.”I suggest you tell your parents that you know that they are only trying to protect you. Tell them that you understand you’ve been a little over the top with staying up to talk to your guy the last few weeks but that you can settle down now. Ask them to set a curfew for phone use and respect it. Once you’ve shown them you can do that, you can ask them to help the two of you meet up for a day at either his house or yours. If this relationship is meant to be, it won’t fizzle if you slow down a bit. Let your parents get to know your boyfriend gradually so they can see what you see; that he’s really a great guy.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My father has been dating this woman for 6 years. I believe that she is only after his money, as she demands a $90,000 car, a new house, and many vacations — none of which he offers us. He has never mentioned her to me, only my two sisters. My sisters told me about her and I always secretly knew that my dad was dating even though he didn’t want me to know. After 6 years of dating, my dad tells my youngest sister that he has proposed to her. At this point he still has never introduced me to her. I feel like he has been lying to me for all of this time. I try to keep a healthy relationship with him, but sometimes I feel disconnected from him as he is keeping me from huge part of his life. I don’t want anything to do with her or her bratty children. I want to talk about but he would just tell me that I don’t know anything. I heard this afternoon that there is an official wedding date set for next month and I still have not even met her. She is a very promiscuous person and I know that this marriage would do only harm to everyone in my family. What should I do to put a stop to this wedding and better my relationship with my father?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I am sorry to hear of the strained relations between you and your father. Your dad obviously doesn’t want your input, and most likely knows you would disapprove. I would not wait, but rather tell him that you are disappointed in the fact that you feel this woman has eclipsed you in his life. Don’t try to change the wedding, or him, or her. Just let him know your feelings about you.Rather than condemn her and his behavior, or try to control his decisions, put your emphasis on being honest and telling him how you feel about what has happened. You are the world’s expert on your feelings so you are always on safe ground to express them. As soon as you try to control your father by altering his thinking and behavior, you are in the weakest position with him you can be.Finally, I would show him this response so that he knows the depth of your concern. From there you can talk about your feelings. Your father is going to be whom he is and will do what he wants to do. The most you can do now is let him know your disappointment and frustration.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

First off I would like to thank you for taking the time out to help me. But the problem is I’m depressed but nobody knows it. Half the reason I am is because I have no really close friends to hang out with or etc. While everybody is usually going to the movies, the beach, or somewhere fun I’m at home. My mother has started to notice it, she always suggests I hangout with my friends but truth is I don’t have the heart to tell her I don’t really have any. It started at the age of 11 when I started to notice I didn’t have a lot of friends like all the other kids did.<|im_end|>

 Thanks for reaching out for help so you can start to feel better. It is painful, especially during the teen years, to be excluded from peers and to feel on the outside of social events.  I feel bad that you’ve been so mistreated by your peers. No one deserves to be bullied, made fun of and tormented, including you. If this is happening at school, please reach out to a counselor or administrator so they can help put a stop to this cruel behavior and make sure that they keep your identity private so you don’t have to suffer retaliation from peers. Their behavior is unacceptable.I’m curious about your comment, “I hate it when people have sympathy for me.” Sympathy and empathy are ways that people express love and concern for you, which is what we all ultimately want and need. I know it feels like a huge risk, but the only way to help the loneliness is to let someone in and share your painful feelings with — your parents, or a trusted teacher or school counselor. Please let someone know how down and alone you feel. Please talk to your parents about your depression and ask them for help in finding a counselor in your area who works with adolescents. Also, your parents or counselor can help you find an adolescent therapy group to help you practice relating to peers in positive ways, help you understand why relationships are so difficult for you, and develop the skills to build and maintain strong friendships.It’s hard to believe, but your life can get better and you can have meaningful relationships, but the first step is to let someone in your life know about your pain and ask them for help.Take good care of yourself.Julie Hanks, LCSW<|im_end|>"

Hello there, I am Kate and I’m 14. I’ve felt a strange feeling of lack of emotion for a long time. I feel like I’m constantly on autopilot and, like a robot, apply certain emotions to situations where they deem appropriate. I don’t genuinely feel sadness, or anger, or happiness but I act like it. I know that I don’t feel anything, nor does anything leave any kind of impact on me. I’ve had a lot of important things happen to me recently but I cannot feel any sort of impression or even memory. My memories are nonexistent or blurry, like I’m living in a dream (as in, everything is so blurry and fast) I don’t feel connected to myself. I just have a body. I make lots of unconscious decisions. Just completely autopilot. Whatever feels necessary. Whatever is socially acceptable. I have friends who emotionally depend on me but I can’t, I simply cannot, feel sympathy or empathy. I cannot commit to anything, I’m not passionate about anything except painting, but it doesn’t feel like passion. It’s just something that I do. I just do it, because I like it. I plan on making a career out of it, and I know after years of doing it that it’s the only thing I’ve ever committed to (or the longest thing I’ve committed to). I like acting and drama, because its easy. Because acting is what I do all the time; I display emotions in ways that are believable. That’s why I’m good at it, too.<|im_end|>

 It seems that what you may be feeling is apathy. Apathy is an absence of emotions. People who are feeling this are indifferent to life. They lack the normal range of emotions. Sometimes, apathy is indicative of depression. It may be that you are going through a difficult time. You may not be engaging in activities that are bringing you joy. I would need more information to know what, if anything, is wrong.Are you taking medication? Some medications have side effects which can cause apathy. Antidepressants, for instance, can cause the type of emotional numbing you have described. Explore this with your prescribing physician, if applicable.It’s good that you have acting as an outlet. It allows you to express your emotions. The fact that you do express your emotions during acting is encouraging. It means that you can express them. You should try starting a mood journal to document your feelings. It might be a good way to understand what is bothering you.You mentioned being afraid to talk to your parents. Many teenagers feel that way. They don’t want to be a burden and worry about the stigma of mental health problems. You should talk to your parents. They can handle whatever you have to say. They will know how to help you. Everyone struggles in life. It’s part of living and talking is a way to feel better. That’s how problems are solved. If these issues remain hidden, they may worsen and that is an outcome that can be avoided by taking action. Problems can be easily resolved but only if dealt with appropriately. It’s best to tell your parents, ask them for their assistance and consult a mental health professional, if necessary. Good luck with your efforts. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

How can I explain to an ex-boyfriend who left state and returned that he needs help for is DID? My current psychologist couldn’t answer this question, but flipped it off as insignificant.  I fell in love in Jan. 2010 with a foreign worker who was here to repair damage in the condo after carpet removal and air scrubbing.  I texted him I was i terested and we had a first date.  He ran out unexpectedly, with no excuse and did not return.  ‘Gone then for 3 months to his “country”, back once, ran out with no reason, gone another month, “for a funeral”; back, ran away, then back after another 3 months saying he was emotionally sick and went back to his home country, and was sorry he didn’t call.  During all this strange interims, I hired a detective, then, found out in July he ran to another state, after saying he had gotten a new apt., broke his leg, came back, called me after I left a message at his work, then went back to the other state, back in two weeks to give no reason for his leavings, except that, “a man leaves because a man leaves.”  My question is:  since I noticed he had DID, and he agreed, and had tried to get help, can I assume the relationship is doomed or is there hope if he gets help, that he could ever be stable, or so men with this affliction just drift through life never really finding happiness?  Thank you for reading.  I would not give him a second thought, except that I did have real feelings for him, not just because of his illness.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 What a tough situation. I think the best approach is to express your concern about his illness and strongly encourage him to get into a psychiatric evaluation to see if he indeed does suffer from Dissociative Identity Disorder. If your ex doesn’t want to get help, there is nothing you can do. If he does seek help there may be some improvement in his behavior and his stability through individual psychotherapy. I suggest you ask yourself “Why am I attracted to someone who is so unavailable and unstable?” There may be some deeper issues for you to explore in your own therapy. Thanks so much for writing in.Take good care of yourself!Julie Hanks, LCSW<|im_end|>"

Hi! I am currently a junior in high school. I am one of the top students in my class, but this year I have been doubting myself. When I am alone, another side of me comes out. It kind of scares me. This part of me is sad and tired. When I am with my family and friends, I am an outgoing, happy, and positive girl. However, if I am alone I become certain that I am a failure and will never be able to meet my standards. I’ve become obsessed with the fact that if I screw up I could be kicked out of NHS and that I will not be able to renew a scholarship I have, if I have a “B” in any of my classes. I am really worried that I have too much on my plate, because in addition to my schoolwork, I am involved in my school’s musicals, plays, participate in my school’s Student Ambassador program, I ride horses, volunteer with various groups, and also tutor kids. I worry that I might breakdown.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Maybe you do have “too much on your plate.” That could be why you are feeling stressed. Perhaps you have taken on more than you can handle.Another possibility is that your standards about yourself are unrealistic. The problem with unrealistic expectations is that they are, by definition, unobtainable. Unobtainable standards eventually become burdensome. They can also lead to depression or feelings of guilt for not having done something they an individual is convinced that they “could” have done, when in reality they could not have.It may also be that you are misjudging your abilities and accomplishments. For instance, you are “certain” that you will be “kicked out” of high school and will be unable to receive your scholarship. You believe that despite your being one of the “top students” in your class. Realistically, there is very little chance that a “top student” would be “kicked out” of high school and not granted a scholarship.I think it was very wise of you to ask this question and to being open to the possibility that you may have overwhelmed yourself with too many activities. My recommendation is that you discuss your concerns with your parents and a counselor to determine what the problem may be and how to correct it. Talking about these issues will help to correct the problem. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

…and spanked for punishment. Why do I have this innate need to be dominated by my husband? I recently asked him to spank me as punishment when I disrespect him by fighting with him or raising my voice to him and there are a few other rules we set when I asked him for this. My parents did not have a relationship like this it is just something I have felt and needed within myself since I married my husband. After he spanks me there is no sex – it is strictly a discipline session and then we just move on. So i don’t believe i would call it a fetish so to speak.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You don’t mention any sexual component to the spankings. You do say that there is no sex following the spankings. This does not mean that there is no sexual component. Do you have sexual fantasies about spanking or your husband’s domination? Do you need to feel his strength and power as part of your sexual relations? These are all things that I would like to know and would need to know if we were conducting a counseling session.There could of course be deeper psychological reasons for why you ask to be punished regularly by your husband. It would take conventional counseling sessions to uncover this information. I would encourage you to write again with more details. There are many reasons why you may be seeking your husband’s domination that are of a nonsexual nature and I will list a few below. Please recognize that what I write below is not meant to be an explanation of what you are feeling but instead just an example of why someone would crave domination in a nonsexual way.With an obsessive-compulsive disorder one feels the need to seek order in a anxiety-producing situation. Perhaps when you are fighting with your husband or arguing you feel anxiety and fear. To bring order to the situation, to end the indecisiveness, you simply ask for his domination which puts him back into control. When he has control you do not. In essence it’s like asking him to drive the car when you become nervous in traffic. The spanking is a conclusive end to an indecisive situation.There are also possible psychoanalytic causes or explanations. If one was spanked as a child, as an adult that person could find relief by receiving a spanking. Before the child is disciplined there is usually a state of anxiety between the parent and the child. The child may feel unloved or frightened of losing the parents’ love during this period of anxiety. This period of anxiety is ended and thus brings relief after the administration of the spanking. The child may come to see the spanking as a desirable end of the anxiety.There are many, many reasons why you could feel the way you do. It is something that you should discuss with a therapist. It is normal to have problems in a relationship. The most important thing, far more important than the problems themselves, is how those problems are resolved. The correct resolution is never for one person to simply submit to the domination of another. A marriage is an equal partnership and both partners should have equal power. In this sense it is not healthy to end disagreements or periods of anxiety with your husband by your submitting to his domination. Please feel free to write back with more information. Please also consider counseling. I wish you the very best of luck.<|im_end|>"

At an early age, I’ve always disliked people my own age. I thought that they were immature compared to me. As I got older, however, I started getting used to my ever-changing body, and so did everyone else. My opinion of them has not changed over the years, but it appears that everyone is “growing up faster” than I am on the sexual side of things.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You may feel as though you are the only one without a sexual partner but is this accurate? Statistics show otherwise. Recent surveys of teenage sexual activity show that only 46 to 55 percent of males have ever had sex. That means roughly 50 percent of males in your age range have not had intercourse. I point this out to demonstrate that just because one feels something to be true does not mean that it is.It’s also important to keep in mind that people do not always tell the truth. People may lie about the activities they are engaged in. They may brag about things they haven’t done. They may also embellish a story. They typically do this as a way to enhance their self-esteem. They may also do it to increase their popularity, make others feel jealous or to fit in with their peer group. A recent online survey conducted by Seventeen magazine, featured in USA Today, surveyed 1,200 teen and young adult males between the ages of 15 and 22. Several intriguing statistics were found:Another interesting statistic was that approximately 78 percent of the teens surveyed said that there was “way too much pressure” from society to have sex. You may be feeling this societal pressure.These statistics do not support your assumption that everyone is having sex. It’s important to focus on facts. It is imperative to be factually correct in your thinking.You wanted to know why you hate other people, particularly those who seem like they’re having more sex than you. If you believe that everyone is having sex but you then this may signify in your mind that there is something wrong with you. You might assume that others will also think the same thing. If you don’t hold this opinion of yourself yet feel others do, you could be angry at them for misjudging you. This could explain the anger you feel.You also believe that everyone is “growing up faster” sexually than you. Again, this assumption may be inaccurate. As I pointed out above males, according to the Seventeen survey, tend to exaggerate how often they have sex or even if they’ve ever had sex. In the survey, 45 percent of the males said they were virgins and those are the ones who “admitted” to being virgins. Because people do not always tell the truth in surveys, that figure may be conservative.I’m also curious about your dating and social life. You did not provide those details in your letter. Are you able to make friends? Do you have both male and female friends? I wonder if you have trouble dating? Do you have difficulty securing a second date? Having answers to these questions may have shed light on how well you socialize with others. If you have difficulty socializing you might benefit from social skills training.I want to compliment you on the fact that you are able to see yourself objectively, at least with regard to your physical appearance. You describe yourself as being slightly obese. To combat this problem you began to exercise. I understand that exercise is not making you happy but look on the bright side, it has made you feel livelier. It seems that exercise has improved your overall well-being. This is very positive.Your solution to this problem is to have sex. It’s important to keep in mind that sex is not something that should be done casually and with just anyone. Sex has consequences. It can include unintended pregnancy and being infected with a sexually transmitted disease. The purpose of a relationship is not just to have sex. Sex is part of relationships but if it’s the sole purpose, that relationship won’t last long.You describe feeling intense emotional pain. Because of this I would recommend counseling. Counseling may also help you develop better socializing skills, if needed. It can also help you develop relationship and interpersonal skills. A therapist can also help you to better understand the nature of relationships. I believe you could benefit from therapy.I hope I have adequately answered your questions. If you’d like to search for a therapist in your community, try searching this website. Thank you for your question. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Until a few months back I used to play GTAV at my friend’s house without my parent’s permission, this went on for three years and then I told them. They didn’t get that mad but told me I couldn’t play it anymore. The problem is that now that I never play it anymore I feel a very strong need to play it and since no other game can replace it I feel unhappy and unfulfilled. When I actually write it out the first time it sounds really pathetic but it’s actually quite a big problem. I wasn’t very happy with my life before but video games was an easy way to cope with other things (when I say cope I don’t mean through extreme violence like in GTA’s case, more like a person who really likes soccer and uses that). The reason my parents won’t let me play it is because of the mature content but I’m not interested in the sex and drugs and the violence is unrealistic enough not to affect me at all. To be honest I don’t really feel anything special when for example killing people in video games. I’ve done a lot of research and I like to think that I know more than most people about psychology and I’m very sure that I’m not a psychopath nor narcissist. An example from the game is this one scene involving torture which I found pretty hard to get through. I’m also quite intelligent for my age and has scored 121 on an IQ test, I’ve also got really good grades and stuff so I think that that’s maybe why I’m not affected by violence I know is fake. I’ve also already done pretty much everything in the game and seen almost everything in it in movies and tv series, so I kinda feel like I’ve seen everything and that all potential damage is already done. My parents have also said that you shouldn’t take chances and that I may get affected even though I didn’t before. That may be but I’ve actually begun to feel really depressed and sad most of the time and I know that there’s no other way to fix it. I think that’s because it was one of the things I enjoyed doing the most and now I can’t anymore. I would be so thankful if you could help me. Thank you!!! (From Sweden)<|im_end|>

  Withdrawal symptoms from internet gaming is a disorder that is being studied and reviewed as this article explains. While there is, as yet, no conclusive treatment or agreement on it, it sounds like you are experiencing a reaction that has come exactly from stopping. There isn’t an easy protocol I can direct you to for treatment, but I do have a suggestion. First, let me say that I think your parents are doing the right thing by trying to curb your use because the more well-known information does indicate it may be harmful. Yet I am impressed by your courage and concern about the impact it has had on your own well-being.I’d advocate for an experiment. Take a period of time that you and your parents could agree to, a week or two, and work out a compromise of playing the game for a minimal amount of time, perhaps a half-hour a day. Experiencing playing the game at some minor level of time engagement might have an impact on you. If it does, then we know there has been a withdrawal effect. The key here is for you and your parents to be working together for your best interest, improving communication with each other, and testing out ways to help.If you use it and feel better, then I think we follow a recovery model. Find the absolute minimum of time you could play it to prevent the withdrawal reaction from getting activated. Then find a way to keep it at that minimum — or wean off of it slowly.I wish I had something less experimental to offer, but the current state of the science doesn’t offer anything conclusive beyond experimentation.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Thank you for writing. I hope, I hope you have talked to your medical doctor about this. You may be right this is a symptom of anxiety. But it’s also possible that it is coincidental that a disagreement seems to trigger it. Headaches like you describe are not something to ignore.I don’t agree that there isn’t a real problem — whether it is medical or stress. Pain is a way that a person’s body signals that something is wrong.I think you are used to being self-sufficient and able to take care of things yourself. But one of the most important ways we can take care of ourselves is by knowing when to look to others for a little help. If your medical doctor doesn’t find a cause, do see a therapist for a few sessions to figure out why the ways you have managed stress or anxiety in the past are no longer working for you. A therapist can also help you learn some new ways to help yourself.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My 7 year old son on numerous occasions has acted out inappropriately in front of his friends and other boys his age, butt touching, pulling down his pants and the other boys pulling down their pants, always wanting to look at his 4 year old brother’s body parts down there, they’re always touching each other’s butts and laughing about it and he knows it’s wrong don’t know what to do about this. This has been going on since he was 3 years old, the doctor said that it was normal that he was just probably going through a stage back then but he still does it and I do not see this as normal now? I constantly talk to him about this and tell him that it’s wrong but I’m at a lost for words cause it seems to be doing no good he still does it. He gets punished for it and now hides it but when he gets caught he cries and apologizes because he knows that it’s wrong. I need some advice on how to get my son out of this phase. HELP Please!<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m sure this is very worrisome and painful for you. You are right to be concerned. Your doctor was right: It is normal for a 3-year-old to go through a stage of curiosity about bodies. But it usually subsides way before age 7.Please make an appointment with a child therapist. I don’t have enough information to go on. A counselor can help you get to the cause of this behavior and will give you guidance about how to handle it.The most benign possibility is that you have become so worried about his behavior that your son is simply trying to get extra attention and concern from you. He’s learned that all he has to do is tug his brother’s pants and he gets your full-on attention. For some reason, he’s decided he can’t get the same involvement by doing positive things. In that case, you need to learn other ways to avoid reinforcing his inappropriate interests and at the same time give him positive ways to be engaged with you.At the other end of the spectrum of possible causes for this behavior is that your son has been abused sexually by someone and is acting out what he is too scared to talk about. This is not at all uncommon in kids. In that case, you need to protect him and get him treatment.Or his behavior may be about something else entirely. That’s why you need to see a therapist. You want to respond to the real cause to get him past whatever it is that is troubling him.This has already gone on far too long. Please see a counselor and get the help you need to steer him to more socially appropriate behavior before he gets any older. If he’s been hurt by someone, he needs treatment. If it’s attention-getting behavior, it’s likely he will be bullied and isolated by his peers. Of equal concern is that he may become very confused about sex and sexuality as he gets older.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I was in a relationship with someone who abused me to the point I didn’t want to live anymore. He cheated on me, as well. He also allowed for his girlfriend to harass me. They even had sex and filmed it in my bed. After another physical attack, I called police. He’s still in jail months later. Recently, I was approached by a ‘mutual friend’. I was concerned, at first, but then talked it out and he assured me there was no connection. A month later, he brought another woman into my home and proceeded to be sexual with her while another of his friends was visiting. There is something wrong with me that this would go on. This is the same woman, I think. I didn’t see her, but I heard her and she sounds the same as the woman my ex was with. She’s broken my windshield, she tormented and injured one of my cats, she’s stolen from my purse, she’s stolen my house and car keys, she’s TORMENTED me. My ex denied denied denied. He called me crazy. When packing up his things, I found a pair of airline slippers under his nightstand. They were small — a female size 7 or 8, slim. I also found baby monitors with power cords. I actually broke down and hid a video camera outside. It recorded her climbing in our bedroom window with my ex’s help. She did this while I was downstairs making dinner. At times, I felt something was going on, but I didn’t ‘check’ on it, because I didn’t want to be wrong and look crazy or dumb, and I didn’t want to be right and look crazy or dumb. Because this had gone on for such a long time, I think I might’ve killed her if I’d have caught her. 400 words can’t do this justice. I wont be surprised if you call me crazy, too. I have no one I can trust. I tried to be a good woman. Why has she focussed on me like this? Is it fun? I never could get a name, of course, so I can’t get an anti-harassment order or anything. Even before the ‘mutual friend’, I thought she’d been in my house again, but decided I was being paranoid. This last incident makes me wonder, now. This has me so confused and I think I am crazy, now.<|im_end|>

 These things either are or are not happening to you. You are not paranoid if the things that you are claiming to be true are in fact true.You said that you have recorded the woman you suspect to be harassing you climbing in and out of your bedroom window with the help of your ex. If you have that video evidence, then you should give it to the police. It would be proof of your claims.You wrote that you have no one that you can trust but that is no more true for you than for anyone else. Some people are trustworthy and some people are not. You should be able to trust the police, a minister and a therapist. That’s true for you and everyone else. Of course there are exceptions, but generally speaking you can trust those people. Their level of trustworthiness is the same for you as for anyone else.Try trusting a therapist. They will help you to sort out your situation. They can be the calm, cool, objective listener. They can offer advice. They can help you to feel better.It is frightening to have someone harassing you. You would benefit from having a trusted friend or a counselor to help you through this difficult time in your life. Counseling could help to relieve the stress associated with these troubling situations and to learn how to best protect yourself. You should consider it. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: My girlfriend and I have been in a rocky two-year relationship. She is amazing and my best friend. We are engaged now. We have many external stressors (my med school, her being in a city she hates, money), but also both have respective insecurities, anxiety, depression, and trust issues. I’ve come to realize that many of the problems I bring to the relationship are tied to insecurities and low self esteem. Thus, I tend to use her as a litmus test for my self-worth.<|im_end|>

Your girlfriend has done the best she can to help you. In spite of your best efforts, the two of you haven’t been able to help you come to terms with yourself.

But I think you may have run into a couple of tactless women who weren’t interested in you and then you developed an idea that you aren’t attractive. The cause is now lost in the mists of the past. But that cause, whatever it was, doesn’t have to inform the future.First. Listen to your wife. Hers is the only female opinion that matters anyway. She thinks you are beautiful inside and out. Please take a hard look at why you find it necessary to be attractive to other women when the woman you love thinks you’re the best thing going.That being said: If you need to feel like you can attract women in order to feel good about yourself, here are a few surefire steps:Please — Be careful about what you wish for. Think about what you will do if a woman responds to your new persona. Take care of your marriage.Frankly, I think there are better attributes to hang your self-esteem on — like being kind, honest, a good husband and father, and a positive member of your community. Beauty is, after all, only skin deep.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From Canada: Hi, I have been dating my boyfriend for about a year now, he had a girlfriend for a pretty long time before me, and I knew when we started our relationship they were still friends. I was actually pretty sure he wasn’t over her, I had brought this up to him and he denied it, and eventually she left the city for a few months. But every time we run into her you can tell she’s not over him by the way they act. I’ve caught her texting him twice now, and when I confronted him he said they hadn’t had contact for a while before that, and he showed me the text and that he never responded back. He gives me no reason not to trust him, but for some reason I really don’t. I question everything he says to me, and I always have these terrible thoughts that he’s lying to me. I don’t know what to do because I love him, but I just keep having such bad thoughts about him. Her birthday is next week and I really have a feeling he is going to tell me he’s going out with people from work… How do I bring this mistrust up to him, or should I? How do I stop thinking these terrible things about him, when he hasn’t done anything.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You knew from the beginning that they were still friends. Just because it didn’t work out doesn’t mean they can’t be interested in what happens in each other’s lives. The generous and trusting thing you can do about her birthday is to add your good wishes to his and support him if he wants to take her out for a glass a wine before coming home to you. If your relationship is strong, periodic contact with the ex isn’t going to matter.The most important factor in a love relationship is mutual trust. If you can’t bring that to the relationship, when your boyfriend clearly deserves it, all the emotional aspects of love won’t make up for it. If you keep believing you are in a contest for his love, you will lose. At some point, he won’t be able to tolerate always being under suspicion.No, I wouldn’t bring it up to him any more. From all you said, it’s your issue. Work on yourself. If you can’t relax, it might be helpful to see a therapist to get to the root of your anxieties and learn how to manage them. I hope you will. It sounds like the guy is worth it.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

The Reason I am writing on here is because at this time in my life I am not able to see a therapist but I am going through some questionable moments right now. At the current time for at least a week and a half I have been depressed. I’ve had bouts of depressed on and off before, but I don’t recall it being this severe, I am starting to question my mental status just a few months before leaving home. Usually I am a motivated hard working chatterbox who likes to do stuff and be silly. But I will admit I get a lot of mood swings where I am angry or I’m crying or something but I usually blame it on that time of the month. Lately though no matter what I Force myself to do to try and cheer up I cant shake the depression (and its not that time of the month) Its like I keep battling myself and I feel that the problem is getting worse. All I want to do is sleep and listen to music and I feel like I can’t even talk to mom about it nor do I want to talk about it, I’ve only talked to my friend. I keep putting on a face because I don’t like people knowing I don’t feel well, but my mom knows something’s up. I haven’t been keeping up on stuff I usually do and it’s making me get angry with myself for basically slacking. Part of me says it’s all in my head but another part of me says something’s not right. I wouldn’t say I haven’t had thoughts of death but I always find a way of rationalizing in my head why not to do it. Yet I wonder if this keeps getting worse how much will it take before I completely lose it? I am sure the following do not help, my thyroid is underactive and I used to get sick often, (but now I am very healthy, taking all my supplements and even my doctor is very impressed and that I am physically in very good shape). My home life is stressful; my dad is sociopathic and has been to 3 therapists yet refuses to change. I would just like to move on in life. I know this is probably a bit choppy but any insight would help.<|im_end|>

 I applaud your effort for writing us here and asking directly for help. There are three things that you have said that I think require some attention.The first is the medical need for action. First, since you are seeing a physician I would ask him or her to recommend an outpatient clinic that would be able to see you for psychotherapy on a free or sliding scale basis. Therapy is a good idea so that you can manage some of your emotional needs through the help of a therapist. Many local community hospitals have this service and it would be good to capitalize on your connection with your physician.Second, I would also recommend attending an Alanon meeting. While I realize you have not mentioned that someone you know has an alcohol issue, it may be the case where you are aware of someone in your sphere who has a problem. Even if not I would recommend attending an open Alanon meeting. Often the culled wisdom they offer is strikingly similar if you are dealing with someone with chronic mental illness (as you say your dad is) or dealing with those who have an alcohol problem. The support from such a group might be very helpful.Finally, I would encourage you to join one of our online forums to discuss your situation with others who will understand. This is a free service and can help you get the support you need.Wishing you patience and peace,<|im_end|>"

I’m a 34 year old male and for many years i went through phases where i was very hard on myself, no matter what i achieved, I would still tell myself that its not good enough and pretty much destroy any sort of “good feelings” that i assume come with such things. Thats not to say that i’m a perfectionist , the work i’m in now is far from impressive, nor is any other aspect in my life, in short to say that i’m a failure is a understatement. Over the past 16 months i have been going to counseling and talking about these feelings, along with some very strong feelings of anxiety, that almost lead me to taking my life, and things have got a little better , i’ll admit its nice to be able to sleep without first reliving almost every event of the pervious day and picking out the mistakes i made and how these mistakes will affect me. despite all this, i still feel that i’m the same person, i should be better , i should be in a better work position , i should be more outing , but i’m none of these and fear I never will be; simply because all of the things i’ve done so far are no good if i’m just going to remain in the same position. I’ve tired different methods of dealing with these feelings ( questioning them, standing up to them, positive self talk, exercise ) but none of these have worked out to well. At the moment i’m stuck, the strong feelings of anxiety have gotten a whole lot weaker, i don’t have a urges to hurt my self physically , but I still feel like the same person and fear i’ll remain like this forever (age 34, from Ireland)<|im_end|>

 Thank you for writing in. My first suggestion is to be patient. You say that you’ve been struggling with these issues for many years, likely your entire life, so it will take time to change these very ingrained ways of thinking and feeling. I’m happy that you are in therapy and seeing progress! In my experience, changing the perfectionistic, overly self-critical thinking that leads to the feelings of “not good enough” can take extensive work. Sounds like you are well on your way.My other suggestion is to supplement the counseling you are doing with other things to accelerate your growth. Read self-help books, go to healing retreats and workshops, join a support group, or try adjunctive therapy techniques such as EMDR or Somatic Therapy. The more you put in, the more you get out. Many of my clients realize that they have much more time and energy to focus on getting well when they spend less time beating themselves up about everything. Choose wisely how you expend your mental energy, and keep up the good work!All the best,<|im_end|>"

From Nepal: My grandmother is at the age of 70s. She is over dominating and enjoys when she creates disputes in the house everyday. She does not feel any shame publicizing family matters openly and badly abusing family members. She has superiority complex for no reason. We have tried talking to her a lot regarding this but when we try to discuss the problem she changes the topic or starts fighting aggressively. During fights she never gets physical but instigates us to harm her through her words so that she can prove to our relatives that we are the ones treating her badly. She tries to act innocent and make us appear bad in front of others and gain sympathy. She gets jealous when my dad buys something for me or my mum and has the habit of demanding the same thing immediately. As soon as someone arrives home from anyplace she pretends to cough and roams around the house to peak what he/she has brought.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 This is so sad. Your grandmother is blessed with a loving family and yet she is making everyone miserable. You didn’t say if this is new behavior. If so, it’s important that your grandfather take her for a complete medical check. There may be an undiagnosed physical problem or she may be in the early stages of dementia. If that’s the case, the doctor will make some recommendations. You didn’t mention what medication she was taking that seemed to help. That’s also important information to take back to the doctor. It may provide a clue about what is wrong.Finally, you really don’t have to fight with her. You don’t have to let her make your life “hell.” When she says awful things, you could just kindly say “I’m sorry you feel that way” and go about your own business. Treat her as you would a sick person — with compassion and sympathy — but don’t respond to her provocations. Alert the relatives and your neighbors that she is mentally ill and not to be taken seriously when she makes a scene. Let them know you are doing everything you can to be helpful and ask for suggestions and support.I really hope you can get her back to a doctor. I’m very concerned that she is indeed a very ill lady.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I’ve had chronic depression starting in childhood with an emotionally absent mother. I was recently diagnosed with PTSD/BPD by new therapist. Christmas marked the beginning of this debacle. which set up the disaster and now my BPD, etc is a Category 5 Tropical Storm. A CONTINENTAL DIVIDE now exists between my son and I has turned awakening my abandonment fears. His response is total silence (he refuses to investigate this new BPD thing) and has cut off any possibility to try to resolve this. Meanwhile ironically enough his abandonment of me over this is not imaginary. Left to my own devices I spend all my days since 1st of the year existing in a pattern of emotional turmoil I can’t take much longer. I alternate between feelings of inconsolable grief and abandonment into resentment and culminating in my anger exploding leaving horrible messages on his phone which increases the gap. If we had talked when this all began it would have never developed into the mega storm it is but now it has – he has made no effort to get insight into BPD – he has genuinely abandoned me. The anger eventually burns out leaving me numb then we start over again. Being ignored as though I don’t exist also fuels the flames. Suffice it to say that I don’t see a way out and I do not want to spend my life cycling between all these painful feelings. I want to be able to talk to him, acknowledge how a part of me knows the rage is wrong and help him understand the mechanics of BPD. But I cannot make him talk to me so he is never going to understand and I am doomed forever to the abandonment I feel. While he was supportive during 2 medial emergencies I experienced now I have to guess that because this alleged malady of mine is emotional he views it something i made up to to manipulate him. He’s withdrawn totally which only multiplies my feelings. Suddenly out ofere he’s gone. HOW DO I SURVIVE this? My warm/caring son is as cold as ice. He has no interest in what BPD is. My days consist of going thru the cycles over and over again, grief, hurt, anger, crying, numbness this is no way I want to live. Is there a way out other than just ending it all?<|im_end|>

 The Borderline Personality Disorder diagnosis must have been tough for you to hear. It also challenged your son. After such powerful information — your son is likely to need some time to adjust.The person that diagnosed you is very likely to have access to resources in the community to help. I strongly recommend taking advantage of those resources, such as support groups and intensive outpatient therapy programs, as well as any individual therapy at this time. This is an adjustment. The important thing is for you to feel support from people other than your son and work on plans for the future. I wouldn’t try to push a dialogue with your son right now.In the meantime our our forums are available for you to connect with others for support.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Since last year, I have discovered that many of the people around me are depressed. I, myself, are on and off,(a little portion of the bipolar in my gene pool.) Last year, one of my close guy friends, who I’ve known since I was two, became suicidal, or he finally attempted it. Our relationship fell apart. Now, I have learned that, despite counseling, the thoughts have returned. Another one of my friends, who has struggled with depression for most of her life, because of many reasons, has included him in her “suicide pact,” (along with one of her long-time friends.) I always accepted this, but lately, she’s becoming more desperate. She might not even live past New Years, or that’s what she’s telling me. I know that life is not worth living, and counseling doesn’t help them, but I’m scared that I will be losing two of the people closest to me (one of which is my reason to live) on the same day and I’m more terrified than ever. The down side is that she’s wanted to die for a very long time, there is no way of knowing when she’ll snap. Her mom doesn’t love her, so for her, there truly is no hope…<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I am glad that you decided to write because it gives me the opportunity to dispel some of your beliefs that are incorrect. You stated that your friends have a suicide pact which you have “accepted” because you “know that life is not worth living…” and that “counseling doesn’t help.”The fact that your friends believe that “life is not worth living” is a clear sign of depression. Depression is a mental illness. Individuals with depression are not thinking clearly. They essentially see the world through the cloudy, misaligned skew of depression. Depression can lead to hopelessness which gives people the false impression that they cannot be saved. That is simply not true. Depression is highly treatable. Millions of individuals are greatly assisted by counseling. Counseling saves the lives of many people.Suicide pacts are not common. The fact that your friends have a “suicide pact” means that they have spent a great deal of time planning to end their lives.Most people who are considering suicide do not want to die. They may choose suicide because they feel as though there are no other options for them. They typically lack effective problem-solving skills but these skills can be learned.Dr. Phillip Zimbardo is the creator and founder of the Heroic Imagination Project (HIP). Essentially, the HIP project highlights unsung heroes and provides education about how ordinary people can be heroes. Dr. Zimbardo has developed educational courses that teach people how to be “heroes in waiting.” A key aspect of being a hero is acting when other people are passive and do nothing.Many people faced with your dilemma might choose not to act. They might keep the suicide pact a secret because they do not want to upset their friends. In other words, they would choose not to be a hero. In this instance, you have an opportunity to be a hero. Dr. Zimbardo says, the opportunity to be a hero “may only happen once in your life and when you let pass it pass by, you’ll always know, I could’ve been a hero and I let it pass me by.” Choosing not to act might become the biggest regret of your life.It is vitally important to alert someone about their plans. This might include your parents, your friends’ parents, a teacher, the school principal, a mentor or guidance counselor, etc. Call the authorities if necessary.Your friends may be upset with you for having revealed their secret but I assure you that it will pass. You would be saving the lives of people who are clearly suffering, are mentally ill and who in all likelihood do not really want to die. Take this opportunity to be a hero and prevent a tragedy. This might be one of the most difficult challenges you face but it is essential that you act accordingly. Don’t let the opportunity to be a hero “pass you by.” Good luck.<|im_end|>"

Most days, I can’t sleep. I’m not talking about staying up too late on the internet or whatever, I can lay in bed for three hours (that’s how much time I usually give it) and I still cannot sleep. I often go to school without having had any sleep at all (2 of the 5 days at least), and that’s really messing with my grades. I’m diagnosed with Dysthymic Disorder, so it would make sense for it to be insomnia. However, if I can manage to fall asleep, I can stay asleep uninterrupted for at least twelve hours. My sleeping schedule generally goes: no sleep one day, one hour of sleep the next, then fourteen hours of sleep. If this problem has a name, it would really help for me to know it so that I can attempt to find treatment (or if you have a suggestion, that’d help too).<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It’s unclear what the problem might be. If I could interview you in person I would have many questions regarding the nights you can’t sleep including: Are you anxious about the day? What are you thinking about? When was the last time you ingested caffeine? Did you eat right before bed? Are you watching TV or listening to the radio? If so, what type of programming? Those are just some of the questions I would ask and there are many others.Your sleep might be impacted by a number of factors including: your dysthymia, your diet, your level of anxiety, your ability to relax, your ability to quiet your mind, what medications you are taking (if any), or a potential sleep disorder. There are other factors as well.It’s important that you find a better way to sleep. Sleep is vital to your well-being and impacts your mental and physical health and the overall quality of your life.I would recommend meeting with a therapist and a primary care physician to assist you in determining what might be wrong. If a sleeping disorder is suspected, the next step may be undergoing a sleep study. Your primary care physician can provide you with a referral to the appropriate specialist. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I am going to try and make this as brief as possible. I have been having thoughts of violence, of killing people. I want to make it clear that I do not want to because I think of what that can do to my future, to my family, and to my friends. I will have daydreams or dreams that are so vivid and real to me. I do things basically to try to satisfy these violent thoughts and urges by watching certain shows or movies, playing violent games and reading about violent crime scenes for example. I will admit that I used to kill small reptiles and the occasional squirrel, never cats or dogs because I like them too much and no one notices killing of reptiles. I would dissect them and see what various things would do to their bodies. This is the first time I have ever admitted to such things because I know that these signs never point to good things plus it gives people the wrong idea. I don’t know what to do or how to handle this because honestly I don’t know a psychiatrist who would see me out of fear of I might hurt them or someone else. More importantly, if I were to say anything like this or self harm or anything else along those lines my insurance won’t cover me. So if I could get any advice on something that would help or a way I could get help that would be great because right now I’m kind of stuck with myself.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 A: Thanks for writing in with your question. I’d first like to suggest that you put your worries to rest about a psychiatrist (or any other mental health professional) refusing to see you because of the thoughts you are having.These kinds of issues are included in our training and we deal with them on a regular basis. Do not let this deter you from seeking help.  Now, if your thoughts of hurting yourself or others get very serious and you and your therapist cannot come up with a plan to keep you or others safe, you may be hospitalized for a few days to be stabilized. But again, that’s not a bad thing and can be very healing. I’d also like to say that in all my years of working in the mental health field, I have never had a client lose their insurance because of what they talk about in treatment. I’ve also never had anyone lose their insurance (or job) for being hospitalized. The insurance companies typically only get data such as the diagnosis, functioning level and dates of treatment, rather than details from the sessions themselves.I recommend that you steer clear of violent shows and video games. There are those who feel that these activities are “cathartic” and help folks release these feelings rather than act on them, however, there are many experts who believe just the opposite. If you already struggle with violent thoughts and feelings, exposing yourself to these themes tends to increase these feelings rather than decrease them. If our unconscious mind controls 90% of our behavior, what do you want to be putting in there? You would most likely benefit much more from finding ways to be kind to yourself and others. Try prayer or meditation, find ways to volunteer in your community, fill your mind with thoughts of peace, and go find a good therapist or psychiatrist. All the best,<|im_end|>"

From a young man in the U.S.: I wanted to understand the link between the upbringing of one , past experiences ,and past ideologies and how much it can affect ones current reasoning. Does a person have utter and complete freedom to change his reality or would there always be a faction of his brain leading him to a biased conclusion because of his past experience. For example can a person fully understand and change his reality without his brain affecting that decision based on his past. In other words , a person who grew up in a religion , and changes his religion, can he or she be able to fully accept a new belief and formulate a new truth based ok current thinking and not be influenced by the past. In other words how much control do humans have to truly shape their reality based on their logic and not be biased based on any past experiences or at least not make a decison base on that fully.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The human mind is a remarkable thing. Sometimes people go through what are called “conversion experiences”. When that happens, the person abandons previously held beliefs and adopts the new religion to the exclusion of their old one. There are powerful examples of this throughout history. You can find numerous personal stories of conversions on the internet.Although the word is usually used in connection with religion, the same can be true of changing other strongly held personal beliefs. We’re seeing some of that in the current political climate. Some people who were in one political party are so upset with what is happening that they shift to another.Sometimes “conversions” happen when someone abandons a habit. Often this happens because the individual has been frightened by, say, a medical diagnosis, or enlightened by new and powerful information.  It’s been said that there is no one more anti-smoking than a former smoker, for example, who has been told that their lungs were precancerous or who lost someone to lung cancer. They not only don’t smoke but they try to get everyone they know who is a smoker to join them in their new life choice.I’m not clear if those are really examples of “conversion” so much as an expression of someone’s need to reinforce their own decision until it “sticks”. But it is an effective way to change a habit or a belief system. In that sense, it answers your question. Yes, people can change their beliefs due to logic or because they have had a powerful emotional experience that causes a fundamental change in how they see things.I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

Thank you for writing but I’m not qualified to answer your question. I’m a psychologist, not a prescriber. Since someone is prescribing your medication, you really need to go back to that person with your concerns. Regardless of the diagnosis or the medication, our helpers can only be helpful if we partner with them. Your prescriber needs to know how you are responding to your medication and whether you are having side effects, as well as any concerns you may have.Please don’t go by what you read on the internet. Although the internet is full of information. it’s unwise to come to conclusions based only on what you read. You are an individual with individual responses to various medications. You and your prescriber can make decisions based on your unique history and experience.Do keep a careful journal of how you are feeling and how you experience the effects of your medications. It will give your prescriber far more accurate information than what you can report at an appointment on the basis of memory alone. It’s difficult to track medication response without writing it down. It’s very human to be unable to call up how things have gone day to day to day since the last appointment.Take that journal with you to your next appointment — or make a sooner one. Writing to us tells me that you do have some concerns. Give yourself the peace of mind you need by talking to the person who knows you.I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

I had the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia with depressive affects and I am still on medications, but I am seeking help to stop my weird behaviors as well as emotional hypersensitivity. I like being requested to go for counseling/ therapy/ medical interviews/ check-ups/ pressured into sex (I will even daydream about the process), I am an obsessive knuckle and joint cracker for no reason (whether in public or private), I get anxious or excited easily, I self-pity sometimes and enjoy it, and I always weep when I am alone after being criticized (should I try not to). Am I lonely and why? (Does that mean I need more emotional attachment and should seek marriage) Hope to get some input and advice from you. Thank you very much.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Perhaps some of your behaviors could be considered “weird” but some would not. You like being requested to attend treatment and being pressured into sex. What exactly do you mean by “being requested?” It may be that when someone requests that you attend treatment, you interpret it as them caring about you.You also characterized your desire to “be pressured into sex” as being “weird.” Sometimes people have fantasies about being the submissive partner during sexual relations and this fantasy is relatively common. If I were interviewing you in person, I would ask you to explain in more detail what you meant by “being pressured.” Without that information I cannot characterize your behavior as being “weird” or not.Obsessively cracking your knuckles and joints, being anxious and easily excited and crying alone after being criticized, may be indicative of anxiety. I would need to know how often these issues arise and in what situations, to determine if they are outside the norm. For instance, what do you mean by obsessively? Every day, all day? Only when interacting with certain people?Without being able to gather more information about the aforementioned issues, it is difficult to provide an accurate assessment of the problem. I would recommend talking about this with your mental health professionals to determine if there is a problem. Only a mental health professional who interviews you in person could answer your specific questions and determine whether or not there is a problem. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I was talking with my boyfriend a few weeks ago and he told me that he was excited to see his friend that day. After all these years together I finally just told him that he didn’t have to pretend to feel things when he was around me, I told him that he didn’t have to pretend to care about these people because I wouldn’t judge him. He then told me that he didn’t understand, he said he really did care about these people, that he wasn’t just hanging out with them to appear normal, that when he spoke to people, he didn’t have to carefully pick out every single word to appear charming or empathetic. I don’t understand how he feels feelings, I was so confident that everyone was just so much better at pretending than I am. People that were less intelligent than I am seemed to be so much better at acting normal, I just assumed it came more naturally. I didn’t go nuts and look up every symptom for a sociopath, I don’t believe an entire class of people can be dissected in a list of attributes, I don’t want to change or talk about it, but I guess I was just wanting an honest answer, does everyone else really feel those things or is everyone like me and it’s just one of those things that no one ever talks about?<|im_end|>

 Sociopath is often confused with psychopath, psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder. The general public, and even some mental health professionals, use these terms interchangeably. There is no diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Health Disorders (DSM), for psychopath or sociopath. The corresponding diagnosis for what many people commonly refer to as psychopath or sociopath, is antisocial personality disorder (ASPD).If you were to look up antisocial personality disorder, you would see a long list of characteristics that must be present to be diagnosed with this disorder. From the e-mail that you have sent me it does not appear that you possess those necessary characteristics. For a diagnosis to occur for any mental health disorder an e-mail would never be sufficient and that is why I can’t provide you with a diagnosis.A diagnosis can only occur when an appointment is made with a mental health professional. In that setting, the therapist can ask you many questions to gather information.Though I can’t provide a specific diagnosis, I can provide some insight into your e-mail. Generally, you are concerned that your boyfriend may feel more empathy toward his friends and may find more pleasure in interacting with his friends than you do. This raises the question whether there is something wrong with your ability to enjoy relationships. Perhaps not. Do you enjoy your relationship with your boyfriend and do you have sincere feelings toward him? Do you have real feelings toward your mother, father, siblings, etc.?If the answers to these questions are yes, then it would seem that your ability to form relationships and function normally in them is unhindered. You simply may be more discriminating, in terms of friendship, than is your boyfriend.There may be nothing at all wrong with you. However, if you have a pattern of difficulty in forming relationships and functioning within them then there may be an issue. Only an in-person interview with a therapist could determine if an issue exists.One or two sessions with a therapist might answer all of your questions. If I can be of any further assistance to you please don’t hesitate to write.<|im_end|>"

 Hello, I was hoping to get an expert’s opinion on this before I seek help. I think I may have clinical depression. I’m not going to get too much into my personal life since I’m supposed to keep this short.For years now, I’ve been feeling very down. Nothing has really excited me and in general I have a pretty negative outlook on life. I feel completely hopeless both in my current situation and while thinking about my future. I always thought it was just hormones and well teenage stuff. I’m nearing the end of my teens now and it hasn’t gone away. In fact, it’s gotten much worse. Lately, I’ve been having a lot of trouble focusing. I used to be able to write school papers in one sitting without too much of a problem. This last week I was supposed to write a one page autobiography and how it relates to my chosen career. I sat down for a good hour and a half and all I had down was three sentences. I have been having short term memory issues-at the end of the day I have trouble even recalling what I did for most of it. I’ve also found that I’ve become very irritable. The littlest things will really start to tick me off. Most of the time I’m melancholy. I don’t really find any joy or excitement for anything, not even what used to be my favorite things to do. There are moments that I want to just break down and cry for no discernible reason. I do have a few moments throughout the day where I feel extremely happy and excited but they go away after maybe a minute at the most. Over the years I’ve just been able to knuckle down and muddle though the days but recently I’ve been having suicidal thoughts. They are nothing too serious as of yet, but they are a serious cause of concern. I’ve also been very fatigued. These days just walking up and down the stairs is taxing. Now, I do have breathing issues, but I really don’t think that’s all there is to it. I took the survey on this site and I scored a 58, severe depression. I have also been to several sites looking at the symptoms of depression. I have most if not all of the ones on every site I’ve been to. I’m writing this because I would like confirmation on what I have found out on my own. Also, I was wondering how I would go about seeking help. I would really like to avoid therapy if at all possible. I am very shy and reserved, I don’t think I would really be able to talk to the person much less enjoy it. If I were to go to a psychiatrist to get formally diagnosed, what would possible treatment options be? Also, I’m sorry that this is so long. I’m pretty sure it’s over 400 words. Thank you so much for your time and I look forward to a response.<|im_end|>

 From the information that you have provided, depression seems like a realistic possibility. You have many of the signs; most serious among them are suicidal thoughts. Happy people don’t contemplate suicide. Suicidal thoughts should always be taken seriously. Undoubtedly, you should seek professional help.You stated that you want to avoid psychotherapy. It may not be what you want to do but psychotherapy is necessary to treat your condition.You should also consider medication. Millions of people have had success with antidepressant medication. Medication works best when the client is also in psychotherapy.Acquiring psychological services typically begins by visiting your primary care physician. Report your symptoms and ask for a referral to a mental health professional. Typically, you will either be referred to a psychologist or a clinical social worker for psychotherapy services. Your primary care physician may prescribe an antidepressant or suggest that you seek specialized services with a psychiatrist.Therapy is the perfect place to learn to overcome your shyness. Being reserved may be your description of an inability to open up to another. Being reserved and shy is not beneficial to you. It is problematic for almost all people who feel this way. Have you ever wished you weren’t that way? Without exception, every client of mine who has described themselves as you have would have answered that they wished they weren’t that way. That is was and has been a problem in their lives. Shyness is a fear. Generally, shy people have been hurt early in their lives, when they opened up to someone. They were ridiculed or made fun of. They may have been described as being “too sensitive.” Sensitivity, as we speak of it here, is a gift to poets, philosophers, writers and therapists. Being described as “insensitive” is an insult. You need to learn techniques and methods to deal with social interaction while fully maintaining your sensitivity. A good therapist can teach you exactly what you need to learn.Please search my earlier posts for my advice on how to find a good therapist.Little things, over time, can add up to full-blown depression. Thank you for writing and from one sensitive person to another, know that I am rooting for you.If you have any additional questions, please don’t hesitate to write again.<|im_end|>"

A couple of months ago, my boyfriend appeared to go through a manic episode leading to a psychotic episode. He was depressed and anxious for a few months time, then suddenly stopped sleeping, eating, and had some false ideas about his capabilities (i.e. starting signing up for dance classes and bee keeping courses out of the blue). I had never seen that behavior in him before.<|im_end|>

It’s important to understand that diagnosis is not an exact science. If he were to be evaluated by 10 mental health professionals, it’s possible that he could receive 10 different diagnoses. They would disagree on the exact nature of his condition, but their treatment recommendations would likely be similar. Thus, in some respects, diagnosis isn’t as important as treatment.When it comes to psychotic disorders, medication is usually the treatment of choice. It often takes a good bit of trial and error to find the right medications. Even when the right combination is found, adjustments will likely be needed over time. It’s the norm.For you, the focus should be less on diagnosis and more on ensuring that he continues treatment. Among people with psychotic disorders, it’s common for them to stop taking their medication. Because they feel better, they often reason that they no longer need the medications. Predictably, when they stop the medications, they relapse. It’s important to be vigilant about his continuing treatment.It’s good that he participates in treatment. It is a positive sign. It will hopefully prevent him from experiencing future psychotic episodes. Be certain to report his progress and your concerns to his treatment team. The more information they have about his condition, the easier it will be to treat his symptoms. For instance, they should know that he is continuing to experience anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and delusions. Medication may not be responsible for all his symptoms, but a medication adjustment may still be necessary. Having open communication with his treatment team is vitally important to treatment success.You also might consult your local National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) support group chapter. This organization provides psychoeducation and support to individuals caring for loved ones with serious mental illnesses.I hope this helps. If you have additional questions, please don’t hesitate to write again. I am glad to help in any way I can. Good luck with your efforts.<|im_end|>"

I really need advice…I’m 26 years old, I have been on in on going feud with my parents for over a year because of my boyfriend. I have known him since I was 7 and we meet in Sunday school. We reconnected about 2 years ago and I’m absolutely in love with him. My parents hate him because of his lack of a college degree, his cultural background doesn’t match ours, and physical appearance. My parents don’t allow him in the house and don’t actually know him. They judge him based on pictures that they have seen and the change in behavior of their once obedient daughter to wild child (apparently). My parents have immigrated here over 20 years ago and unfortunately hold their beliefs tight. My boyfriend has a very good job with benefits, not an alcoholic, doesn’t do drugs, and more importantly is so good to me. They fail to see that, it has become such a bad situation. My mom calls me really offensive names, saying that I am stupid and brainwashed, etc. When she says these things to me I react and I admit many times out of anger, cursing and yelling. I know that is not the way to do it, but I have tried talking to them as adults and civilized. It just doesn’t work. She sends my boyfriend offensive text messages. I really want to be with my boyfriend and I see a future with him. We had a friendship before and I had never had such as strong bond with someone. My parents have this ideal guy in mind for me, rich guy with an education. If it was up to them then I would be in the house until I am 45 when one comes along. I’m not interested, as long as he treats me right then I am ok. Now I am coming to my breaking point. Our arguments and fights are really bad, my family is ashamed of me, my parents are making themselves sick over this. Both my parents say they are going to leave the house and the rest of the family if it continues. I can’t take this anymore. I have a great job and an important year coming up that can be easily ruined with this stress. I really need some guidance because at this point I feel like everyone is just telling me what to do. PLEASE HELP!!!<|im_end|>

 At 26 you’re being overly influenced by your parents’ emotional reaction. It’s unfortunate that your parents don’t realize that the very way they are treating you is the way they fear your loving boyfriend would be hurting you. They are already doing to you what they dread he might do. They are the ones verbally abusing you and trying to control you by hurting those you love.The emphasis here is on moving on. If your parents are threatening to leave the home — wish them well. If you have an opportunity to move out, now is the time to do so. The most important thing that your parents are missing is that in the effort to help protect you they are hurting you in the very ways we are trying to guard you from. If you can’t move out now make a plan to leave and stick to it.Normally I would recommend family therapy, but it doesn’t sound like your parents are interested in this path. I think I would explain exactly where you’re at with them in a discussion. But then make a plan not to live under the same roof. It is time for you to have your own life. The sooner the better.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

 I wish I could be more helpful, but I don’t have enough information to give you a clear answer. What I can tell you is that there are many, many reasons a 20-year-old can be moody. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a mental illness. It may mean that there are stressors in her life that she isn’t handling well. She may have an undiagnosed medical problem. It may have something to do with her feeling like it’s time for her to move out and move on with life but perhaps she doesn’t have the resources or support to do so. It could be that there is a problem with a relationship. And, of course, it is possible that she is showing signs of emerging mental health problems.The best way to find out is to ask her with as much gentleness and support as you can — even if she is making you angry. Being angry with her won’t help. Being compassionate and offering your help might.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

So I’m in love with my brother’s wife. We were friends before they married so I guess you could say I was robbed of a wife and robbed of a life. I’ve been trying my best to bury this situation, but I’ve been unable to cut the roots. Now 15 years later I’m still struggling. I feel so angry and confused but I’m madly in love with her even though it’s so complicated. I wish she was mine but I’m not the kind of person that is jealous of or wants to ruin my brother’s marriage. I don’t know what to do. I’m in dire need of help and advice. (From the UK)<|im_end|>

Thank you for putting forth your question. The most intriguing thing about it is what you haven’t said. There is no mention of your sister-in-law’s interest in you, her life satisfaction with your brother, or any effort at romantic relationships on your part. What you have said seems to have come entirely from your point of view, relating only to your needs, and without reciprocity or validation from her of any kind. There is no mention that “we” are in love, or that there is a joint fascination. The only thing that you’ve identified as the foundation for your feelings is the fact that you used to be friends. Specifically missing in that underpinning is any kind of romantic attraction that is shared.What you have said is that because of this friendship more than 15 years ago “I was robbed of a wife and robbed of a life.” That doesn’t sound like what happened at all. It may, indeed, be what you feel, but did your brother steal her from you? It doesn’t sound that way. It sounds like you didn’t make your feelings known, and that if you did your sister-in-law didn’t respond. Either way, she has chosen your brother, and it doesn’t sound from your email that she has chosen him over you. While that might be upsetting it doesn’t add up to you being robbed of a wife and a life. In fact, saying that may be the very reason you are not moving forward.She was never “yours” in any way, shape, or form to begin with. How can you be robbed of something you don’t have? Your brother has won the girl of your dreams and so there is nothing left for you to do but pine over it, be angry, upset, and confused. Staying stuck and wishing things were different—particularly since you are saying that it is only you that is in love with her. Never once in your email do you say “we” are madly in love. This is one-sided. Otherwise, you would be talking about this as a joint complication between the two of you. Instead, you are talking about it as a highly personal internal struggle. You thoughts operate more like a fantasy than a complicated love interest.Finally, you say that you are not a jealous person. The typical definition of ‘jealous’ is feeling or showing envy because of what someone else has. This is exactly what you are saying. You wish you had the relationship with your sister-in-law that your brother has. This is jealousy.Pining over unrequited love is classically human and is as old as the species. But from everything you’ve said this feeling of being stuck may not have to do with a fantasy of what you wanted. The reason it doesn’t get better is that you are confronting these feelings in a vacuum. Otherwise, you would be talking about how the two of you are going to figure out your love interest in each other.There isn’t enough information in your email to offer more than this, except that in most instances my experience has been that yearning for the one that got away is often a way not to invest in other relationships. I don’t know if that is the case here, but I’d recommend individual therapy to start unraveling the knot that has kept you aching for this relationship to happen, particularly when it hasn’t had much else but a friendship beneath it.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From Canada: I suffered an injury/misalignment to my neck in the past that caused a lot of issues with brain fog/cognitive decline. It also made it so when I got even a little bit stressed out, I’d get a lot of muscle tension, which would only worsen the brain fog/cognitive decline/short term memory loss. And because I had these cognitive issues, virtually everything that would require me to think (reading, writing, research, contemplation, etc) caused stress, muscle tension and then cognitive issues.<|im_end|>

 There are many schools of therapy that might be helpful, I know. But if you were seeing me, I’d suggest we do some work with hypnosis. I’m not suggesting the type of hypnosis that’s on stage where people are made to quack like a duck or something. I’m talking about hypnosis done by a qualified and experienced therapist who specializes in the consequences of injury or pain. In this type of hypnosis, the client is always aware or what is happening and is in control of whether to stay in trance or not. You can learn self-hypnosis skills that will help you manage the triggers.I suggest you contact the division of the Canadian Society of Clinical Hypnosis that serves your province. Their websites have referral networks of professionals who are certified.If hypnosis isn’t for you, I do suggest that you find a therapist you are comfortable with. If you could solve this problem on your own, you would have done so already. Why not get some help?I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: My brother and I grew up with a narcissistic mother. I have read online that this causes a lack of nurturance. As a result when I was 6, 7, 8 my brother and I had sexual relations. I don’t remember much, but it started out with my brother making me give him oral sex until eventually I demanded it in return and he would most of the time. On one occasion, my brother and his friend told me we were playing “doctor” in which I gave them both oral sex without anything in return. My brother also tried to get me to penetrate him, but I refused. As far as I remember he didn’t penetrate me, but I do remember him getting fairly close. A good friend of mine at the time told me something recently that I do not remember in which he said he watched my brother proceed to have anal sex with me. I am very confused as to whether this would be considered sexual abuse or not since he would give me oral sex in return sometimes. I’m still very ashamed of this and hurt deeply by it, and it has been giving me much trouble lately so please respond quickly.<|im_end|>

 You didn’t mention how far apart in age you and your brother are. Many kids who are close to the same age explore sex with each other. They keep it up for a time because it feels good. Sometimes kids’ needs for physical affection aren’t filled. If you were getting very little from your parents, being sexual with your brother may have been especially important to the two of you as it was a way to be touched and to touch. If, however, you brother is older and was in a position of power or authority over you, then what you describe would be termed abusive. The report from your friend is disturbing and supports that possibility.I think you need to sort this out with a therapist. You had legitimate needs as a kid. You have many questions now. Some work with a therapist will give you perspective and a way to put the shame and self-blame behind you. There is no need to carry the hurt and troubling feelings into your future.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I’m not certain of your exact question but it seems that you are asking about having schizotypal personality disorder (SPD). Unfortunately, it’s not a question that can be answered over the internet. Mental health diagnoses require extensive data collection about an individual’s personal and biopsychosocial history. Without that information, it is impossible to know what disorder, if any, you may have.One issue to consider is whether your symptom assessment is objective. For instance, you described yourself as being “unkempt and having vague and unusual patterns of speaking” but you did not provide any examples. How are you making those judgments? How do you define unkempt? What do you mean by vague and unusual speaking patterns? Who are you judging yourself against? Your assessments might be accurate, but it’s impossible to know without specific examples and comparisons. That’s why it would be advantageous to have an objective source who could determine the accuracy of your assessments.I am impressed by your thorough detailing and assessment of your mental status. Your writing is clear and logical. Your next step should be consulting a mental health professional, in person. They would be in the best position to determine whether a mental health diagnosis is warranted. They would also be able to provide treatment, should it be necessary. Thank you for your question. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 I’ve noticed this recently and it’s happened to me in the past. I feel like it’s side affects from the pills I’m currently taking. I have bipolar disease my therapist prescribed me Lamotrigine. My dosage was recently increased, not by too much, but I had been forgetting to take them and was having problems again so I saw her and got my new prescription.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m sure this is very upsetting. Although what you are reporting is not on the list of usual side effects for Lamictal, it’s still possible that what you are experiencing is a reaction to the drug. In all cases, when someone has unusual thoughts or feelings (physical or emotional) when taking a drug, she should immediately contact her doctor to talk about it. Because a reaction is rare doesn’t mean it’s impossible.One thing troubled me in your letter, though. You said the same thing has happened to you in the past. You didn’t mention if it happened while you were taking the same drug. If not, it calls the possibility of a side effect into question. Then it could be that your negative thoughts are a symptom of your bipolar disorder.In either case, do make an appointment with your prescriber right away. It’s always wise to work with your doctor when on psychotropic medications. To do a good job, your doctor needs you to be an accurate and timely reporter.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I’m 18 years old and I been feeling suicidal on and off for about 2 years now. I started to self harm about a few months in to having these thoughts. The thing that confuses me is that I’m  not sure if I should see someone about these thoughts. Sometimes it gets really strong. The way I calm my self down is that I tell my self that its okay, I will 100% kill myself, but I won’t do it now. I have a few different plans. I fear that If  i do go see someone they will tell me that nothing is wrong with me and that I’m an “attention seeker” or that these feeling are just made up. Since these thoughts are not always there. I do feel really motivated to stop selfharming and to get better, I feel so hopeful but it doesn’t last very long, it goes on for about half a day. If I’m lucky it will last a day or too. Sometimes I feel an over whelming sadness, I try not to selfharm but its hard. Also some people cause me soo much anxiety I would have to selfharm. I get dizzy, weak, I start to shake and sweat a bit.It feels unreal, or I feel like Im in slow motion. Its so odd. I don’t know whats wrong with me. Is this something that I should be worried about?? should I seek help or is this all normal? (age 18, from US)<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Yes, I think you should be concerned that you are harming yourself and feeling suicidal, and yes, I do believe that you should seek professional help. I don’t think you should be concerned about a therapist not believing you and accusing you of just seeking attention. If you are open and honest with the therapist about how long this has been a problem, as well as how and when you feel this way, the therapist will be able to help you find alternative ways of coping. You can also explore what might be triggering these feelings and if there is a more serious problem, such as depression or anxiety.You don’t have to do this alone and you don’t have to go on feeling this way. Please make an appointment to see someone soon.All the best,<|im_end|>"

I’ve been professionally diagnosed with depression and briefly received counseling, though my grandmother cancelled my treatment and refuses to continue it. My father cannot convince her to change her mind and my mother is out of the picture. My father supports me, though won’t take any action of his own because he doesn’t believe depression is real. My grandmother refuses to attempt an understanding of depression, and I have nowhere to turn. I’ve asked many times over the course of over entire year for her to allow me help again ever since she has cancelled my counseling, but all my efforts have proven pointless. My condition is worsening and I’m experiencing passive suicidal thoughts, and though I’ve told my family about this, they have purposely done nothing to help me or to get me help. My grandma forces me to literally pretend I’m not depressed, and my father won’t acknowledge me when I mention my depression. Essentially, my family is denying me help and I have nowhere to turn. I haven’t slept for more than a few hours every night night in maybe weeks, I have sleep paralysis and terrifying nightmares relating to my depression, and I battle the urge to self-harm every time I’m alone and whenever my thoughts begin to take over. I’m scared that I’ll soon turn to suicide, and I have nowhere and no one to turn to for help. Please tell me what I should do.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 There are several things that you can do. The likely best option is to contact the school guidance counselor, psychologist, social worker or another trusted faculty member and tell them what’s wrong. They will likely be concerned about your worsening symptoms, especially your suicidal ideation and the fact that your family isn’t helping. Once school officials become aware of these problems, they are mandated by law to act.Other options include asking trusted adult family members for their assistance. What about the mental health professional who diagnosed your depression? You might try contacting them and asking for their guidance. They might then contact your caregivers about seeking help for you.Another option, is to contact child protective services. Being actively denied mental health treatment, despite there being something evidently wrong, could be considered child abuse. If child protective services were to become involved, their goal would not be getting anyone in trouble. Instead, their goal would be ensuring that you receive the proper treatment. To find the phone number for child protective services in your state, Google the keywords “child protective services” and your ZIP Code.If you feel that you cannot keep yourself safe, call 911. Emergency services will respond and keep you safe. They would likely take you to the emergency room, where you would undergo a psychiatric evaluation and receive the necessary care.In the meantime, you should know about the following resources and use them if you need to:You might also try journaling. Journaling is not a treatment for depression. It can however, be a clarifying exercise. Psychotherapy is the best treatment for depression while journaling can help to relieve painful emotions.One final word: please realize that suicide should not be seen as an option. Eradicate it from your thinking. Many people consider suicide because they want to end their pain and don’t know what else to do. There are many, many evidence-based treatments that exist and can make your life better. I know this is true. I have seen it help many people. I hope that the above ideas are helpful. Stay safe and please take care.<|im_end|>"

  I admire your detailed analysis of your struggle. It is clear you have a great deal of courage and persistence in looking for answers.A diagnosis is only important if it helps generate a treatment. I wouldn’t focus so clearly on getting the diagnosis right. In fact, a diagnosis only looks at what is wrong. What it seems to me is that there are a great many things here that are right. I propose shifting your focus to them and changing your type of therapy to group. For your situation it is more dynamic, involves more feedback, and is much less expensive.The group will shift your focus from self-reliance to learning to receive different types of feedback from others — and how to understand that extreme forms of empathy are just as debilitating as not having it. Solving problems for others isn’t the same as self-reflection and experimenting with how to solve your own can happen with a supportive therapy group. The ongoing process of a well-run therapy group will allow you to get direct feedback on your process of interacting with others in real time. Individual therapy traditionally doesn’t do this. (For more information on groups see my blog The Healing Crowd, at Psychology Today.Finally, I would take the VIA Character Survey and read more about developing your many strengths (like persistence and courage) by reading Dr. Ryan Niemiec’s blog.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I’ve been seeing the best therapist I’ve ever worked with for almost three years and, in that time, he’s helped me significantly, including with coming out as trans and gay and gaining confidence to date and try out relationships. I’ve been on several dates with a great guy who is also trans and gay and we just discovered that we see the same therapist. I would say the chances were slim but my therapist is out as a queer man and many of his clients are queer.

 There are many reasonable and ethical ways to do therapeutic work. Some therapists refuse to see both romantic partners. Other therapists (like me) do so routinely.Your therapist is the only one that doesn’t know that he is seeing two members of a couple. That isn’t helpful. The best thing to do is for each of you to give him permission to talk to the other. Say something like, “I know that, due to confidentiality, you can’t confirm whether X is in treatment with you as well as me but we’re a couple. If he is, I want you to know that it’s okay with me for you to confirm with him that I am in treatment with you as well.” Once you each give him permission, he may want to see both of you in a session to figure out the best way to proceed.As you well know, the LGBTQ community in any area is often small and the number of therapists who self-identify is smaller still. As you pointed out, it is inevitable that you will have complicated connections with each other. The best way to deal with it is to acknowledge it and talk about how best to handle it before you run into problematic situations.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 You may not be doing everything you can to help yourself. You seem to have essentially given up. The evidence? You choose not to have friends because of your anxiety. You could have friends, but you’d rather not because you consider your anxiety to be insurmountable. You are thus making a choice, the wrong choice in my opinion.Anxiety is unpleasant, but it’s not insurmountable. No one likes unpleasant emotions, but avoidance only makes them worse. Avoidance reinforces and increases your anxiety and the stranglehold it has upon your life. Instead of choosing to avoid unpleasant emotions, choose to endure them and learn to work through them. In concrete terms, that means having friends even if the thought of interacting with them frightens you. If you face the problems that frighten you, rather than run from them, those problems will eventually not frighten you. With the assistance of a competent therapist to guide you through the process, you can prevail.Anxiety and depression are highly treatable disorders. You should never stop searching for help until you find a treatment that works. It is especially important to find help because of your suicidal ideation. When someone is suicidal, it’s evidence of their suffering.Regarding your parents, it is true that they will eventually die. Everyone who walks the earth will eventually die, but while we are here we must make the best of our time. You mustn’t allow it to be a torture. With therapy it needn’t be that way. There are many support groups and counselors that can assist you.Call 5 to 10 therapists and speak to them over the phone. Choose the one with whom you feel the strongest connection. You might also try connecting with friends and family, members of clergy or anyone else who you think could help. Don’t stop trying until you find relief.Finally, you might also try reading the book The Road Less Traveled: A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth by M. Scott Peck. He discusses many of these issues in his book and provides suggestions for solutions. You might find it beneficial. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My family has had issues through out the the years, but they have steadaly gotten worse. My mother has always had a temper and yells at me and my siblings. she blames this on her past and basicly anything that she can get ahold of to yell at us. My mom even goes as far as to start fights over something that happened over fifteen years ago with my dad, in witch she starts throwing things (ie plates, peanut butter jars, lamps, ) at us and threataning to hurt herself the fights normally end up with mom leaving with rope or a knife to a hotel. Me and my sister cant even do anything about it because if we even try to talk to her she explodes on us and the whole episode is re-created except with one of us in the view.<|im_end|>

 Well, it’s not normal. It’s terrifying. Whatever happened in her past does not give your mother license to hurt her children. No kid should be constantly worried about what she’ll find when she opens a door in her home.Your mother sounds seriously mentally ill. Your dad sounds either overwhelmed or in denial. He and your sister are just keeping their heads down so they won’t be targeted. Instead, he should be your ally and he should be getting his wife some serious help.I’m sorry your mom’s doctors have written off your reports as teen drama. Do try again. But this time, get an adult to help you. If your dad won’t cooperate, please talk to a trusted relative, teacher or your school nurse or guidance counselor. They may be able to help your dad know who to contact and how to get good help. If that doesn’t work, consider staying with a relative for awhile to get yourself out of the way of your mom’s anger.I know this is really, really hard to do. But I hope you can keep the perspective that you are not responsible if your mother succeeds in committing suicide. Her problems are bigger than you can handle on your own. As much as you love her, you can’t give her the professional help she needs. Your dad and her doctors need to do what they can to take charge to avoid a tragedy.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My wife (age 39) has past history of depression followed by several months’ therapy long time back. Lately once every year for the past 3 years for about a period of 2-4 months each year, she has been showing some severe behavioral responses to stressful situations. For normal people, these may not seem stressful situations usually, like house hunting, work load at college, arguments among couples, etc. But often when the stress remains for several days, especially with doing something new, she starts showing various reactions, like sadness, complete change in personality from a jovial one to a quiet depressive one, with a constant facial expression showing emotional hurt, withdrawal from normal activities, complete loss of sexual drive, aversion of eye contact, responding in frustrated way to normal questions, irregular sleep or lack of sleep, irregular eating schedules, complete lack of compassion. Taking one example, she started studying with a seemingly normal mood. She was unable to find a word for her work, which made her extremely frustrated. Even my inability to help with that word was met by seeming skepticism as if I wasn’t actually trying to help. After 3 hours, she got up with a sad expression, complete silence, averting eye contact, and saying good night in a frustrated dejected way and retiring for the day. On normal days she is a very loving person, but she is not a threat to anybody even during the bad days. However, her reactions were more severe 3 years ago, with tendencies to cry all day, sitting in the dark corner of a room, shivering, inability to talk, facial spasms. These don’t happen often and is never visible to anybody outside home. But there is always an underlying chance that any severe condition or normal arguments may trigger her reactions. Somehow, such stressful situations arose exactly once each of these 3 years, and hence that many reaction phases. However she is smart and completely aware of everything and hence not willing to see a professional. My question: What exactly is it that can be going on with her?Is there a name for this?Are there materials that I can read and show her to persuade her to take help? Is there really a treatment? Is it actually a disorder or something else? Please help. This affects daily life and normal relationships at home. (From the USA)<|im_end|>

  It is unfortunate that your wife is not willing to seek a consultation from a professional. It isn’t possible for me to render a diagnosis, but what I can say is that her symptoms are something that are well-researched, understood and treated. I would highly recommend asking her to join you in seeking out a therapist. Let her know you want to find the best way to help and would like her there to explain her situation. Having the two of you go together may soften and facilitate the process. The Find Help tab at the top of the page will help you find someone near you.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

 I think this is such a wonderful question to ask! Please try to look at your college experience as an opportunity to experiment — not something you have control or know exactly what to. About 70 percent of freshmen change their major by the time they are juniors. Just begin with the idea that you want to do something you like. Take the courses and see if you still like it. I was a mediocre student in most areas until I found how much I enjoyed and wanted to learn more about psychology. I never thought I would want to go to school and get a PhD, but it was interesting, I loved the material, and I was good at it. I liked creative writing, but also never thought about making a living as a writer. I certainly never thought I would want to get an MFA in writing after a PhD. If someone told me as a freshman I would ultimately have a career as a psychologist and a writer I would never have believed him or her. As a freshman the thing I thought I wanted to do most was become a physical education instructor. By the way, my parents had some other plans for me to become a plumber, if you would care to read about how well that went you can check it out here.I offer my personal story only because I know it is not unique. If you ask 10 people how they ended up in their careers you would find that the majority ended up doing something different than they originally thought. The idea is to start out doing what you believe will let you thrive and take it from there.There is good research to show that we regularly change our careers throughout life, or enhance them, or reconfigure the way we do them. Think of college as training you how to learn rather than just one thing you will do forever.I would strongly encourage you to learn about your strengths. Dr. Ryan Niemiec is the columnist here on Psych Central for signature strengths. Check out his blog and take the survey to notice your strengths. This can be a great way to learn what you like to do, and how to flourish.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From Australia: I am recently divorced and looking at possibly moving to start over. My parents have been great helping with my daughter by watching her and making sure she gets to her activities and such. The divorce and the circumstances were quite difficult on my daughter and myself and as a result she has been going to therapy to deal with some of the issues.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It’s unfortunate that what should be a helpful discussion has turned into a power struggle. Your mother does have a point. Your daughter has already lost her original family with the divorce. If you move, she will be facing the loss of her grandparents who have provided some stability and an extra dose of daily love during a difficult time.What you see as attempts to “control” you may in fact be a desperate effort by your mom to preserve the kind of relationship she has with her granddaughter. What you see as a big step forward is a big loss for her. Is it possible that she doesn’t experience empathy from you for her feelings? Are the two of you able to calmly talk about how to best support the child as well as the adults in another transition?My suggestion to you is that you stop seeing this as a win-lose battle with your mother. You both love your daughter and have the best interests of the little girl at heart. Invite your mother to a session with the therapist to talk about how to help you move on with your life and at the same time keep the strong ties with your parents that have been a lifeline for both you and your little girl.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Well, I should begin by saying I grew up in a few broken homes and the stereotypical dysfunctional upbringing. Moving from school to school and really only having stability the first six years of my life. I use to be an outgoing kid, but in high school I started to get really nervous and quiet around people. I missed a lot of school to play video games or smoke dope(only because a girl I like did it). I started doing very impulsive things with my life(joining the army, getting married to someone I never met, randomly hooking up with many women in different sexual environments recklessly, having a kid with someone I didn’t know, etc).<|im_end|>

 I would recommend trying therapy again. Perhaps you were not ready for therapy then but are now. You are likely very different now than you were then. You may be more motivated. In the first therapy experience, your mother may have forced you to attend. In this case, you’d be going of your own volition. Your choosing to go and being motivated to go could make the difference this time. It is worth a try.If you decide to pursue therapy, it is important that you find someone with whom you feel comfortable. How can you achieve this? I often recommend calling 5 to 10 therapists and discussing in detail what you would like help with. Ask direct questions such as:Ask for specifics. If you speak to a therapist with whom you feel a connection, then the next step would be to meet with him or her in person. It may take time to find the “right” therapist but when you do, it could make a significant difference in your life.If you are not interested in therapy (which I would advise), then you may want to read several self-help books that have helped many others. I would highly recommend two books in particular: M. Scott Peck’s The Road Less Traveled and Viktor Frankl’s Man’s Search For Meaning.You should also consider being evaluated by a psychiatrist. You may benefit from medication. Medication may not “solve” your problems but it can help you to feel better and to temporarily eliminate the “void” that you feel. I wish you the best.

I have been in a relationship with a man in his mid-40’s for over a year, and as a couple without outside influences we have a supportive, loving and kind relationship, and rarely a disagreement. We moved around the corner from his mum but the last 6 months it appears she has tried to manipulatively break us up. I’ll give you some examples. She came into our home and placed photos of him as a child on our fridge and around the house. We only ever socialise with her, friends her age, and while we are at those occasions she superficially talks up her son’s talents, and looks, and how special he is. My partner lovingly tries to talk about things me or my family are also doing, and every single time she changes the subject, or worse, talks about someone she distantly knows that did the same thing or better. My partner tries to enable me to be proud of myself and my family too, but it’s always to no avail. She has completely shattered my confidence, that I don’t speak much anymore. We’ve been trying for a baby for over a year and she told me when she found out that he can’t afford to have a child because he needs her permission because he owes her money (he doesn’t owe her much). She then tried to convince me to break up with him and go out with my best friend. They have told me for some time the family does not celebrate birthdays, but recently for my partner’s 45th all her friends starting saying his mum was organising a dinner. He said my mother won’t decide for me who I spend my birthday with. I want to spend my day with you.. Next thing, a motorcyclist had bumped the side of her car, no one was injured but he said his mum was in a catatonic state. He then told her she could organise her dinner because she wanted to. We got there, and she had pulled out of her catatonic state pretty brilliantly, with balloons you’d see at 12 year olds party and her two closest friends. I couldn’t get a word in much at this dinner, but one of her friends said she was looking for a husband, and his mum said, darling you should marry her. It’s all caused me so much pain.

 This has nothing to do with Asperger’s. You partner has to step up and confront his mother about her shenanigans. This is simply an immature manipulative effort on his mother’s part. It isn’t worth your time or effort to continuing a relationship with someone that doesn’t accept you. He needs to explain to her exactly what she is doing and how destructive it is. Once this is done –confront her every time she does something that undermines you, and both of you praise her and validate her when she does something supportive. If she doesn’t respond in a reasonable amount of time I’d begin severely limiting time and contact with her.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

My twin identifies as transgender nonbinary, and is biologically female. They are recovering from anorexia (very underweight) and body dysmorphic disorder, as well as depression and hints of bipolar disorder but are acting selfish, cruel, irrational, entitled. This has been happening for about two years, and my parents have been very transphobic and controlling of my twin, constantly fretting over them to eat more and act more “girlish”, as they wish to “return” their physical image and behaviors to their original biological sex. I am their twin, their closest friend and confidant, and we know so much about each other than we can literally finish each other’s sentences and basically read each other’s minds. I can tell when they are upset even if their face expression changes a tiny bit. This is the problem — our closeness.<|im_end|>

 I’m so sorry that you both are going through this. It must be very difficult. I know that twins share a special bond that most of us don’t come close to understanding, so I appreciate your position. However, sharing a bond — and even DNA — does not make you responsible for someone else. It appears that you have tried to be understanding and compassionate, but your twin is starting to take advantage of this and it is beginning to hurt.It seems that your twin is truly struggling with multiple mental health issues, so their pain is real, but it is not your job to fix it. Being transgendered is difficult enough and your twin also suffers from several other serious problems. Your twin needs professional help. If they are already seeing a therapist I might suggest that you ask to go to a few sessions so that you can share your experience of what is happening. Furthermore, even if you do this, it might be helpful for you to also see someone on your own, especially considering that you may be going off to college. Dealing with a separation of this nature could be hard on you both. You may also need some help in setting healthy boundaries and knowing when to speak up and when to let things go. You shouldn’t have to be crying in the shower! Please reach out for help and remember that loving someone does not make you responsible for them.All the best,<|im_end|>"

I was brought up in a religious home and have struggled with the belief that I am possessed. I know it sounds crazy but the feeling is very real. Since early adolescence, I am visited by an evil presence quite often while asleep. He tries to enter me and I am frozen in complete fear. He speaks to me and threatens me with things I can’t bring myself to write or tell anyone. As a child my mom would take me to church and they would pray for deliverance but it never went away even though I eventually told her it did. A few years ago, I started seeing a psychologist for anxiety. After a year and a half of therapy I finally had the courage to tell my therapist about the sexual contact I had by three men when I was between the ages of 6-15yrs. My psychologist is convinced that these possession episodes are flashbacks to those experiences. Is he telling me the truth? I want to believe him but I’m afraid. It’s been very difficult to process the memories from the childhood experiences because of the shame and guilt I feel for being so needy. I enjoyed the attention and even initiated much of the contact. I may have been a child but I knew it was wrong. I feel like God is punishing me.<|im_end|>

  I admire the courage it takes to bring this issue to us. It sounds like it has been bothering you for a long time and I appreciate the bravery to write about it here.The therapist is helping make a link between the abuse, your sense of guilt, and feeling punished by god. Somehow the connection between these elements seems to be important.The fact that it took you such a long time to acknowledge this with your therapist is also important and I would follow his insight as you keep exploring this. Since you’ve trusted the therapist for this amount of time, it seems very reasonable to continue the trust as it is part of the healing. Let him know the struggles you are having with being afraid.<|im_end|>"

A; Sometimes the situations we find ourselves in in life have nothing to do with the choices we’ve made or the intentions of our actions. It sounds clear that you were just a child; you had no power or influence in the dynamics of your mom and dad. It also sounds like your father’s remarriages have been difficult and unsupportive of your needs. It sounds like the first order of business is to not expect your family to give you what they do not have.At 13 it makes sense that school and your teacher would be where you find comfort and support. While you say you have lost your most supportive teacher I think looking back in your school for a guidance counselor or teacher to talk to be exactly the right thing. Sometimes when we can’t find the love and support we need where it should be – we have to look in new places. It sounds like it is time for you to find adults and friends you can count on.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Recently I’ve been thinking about physically torturing others and I’ve been kinda concerned about it. I would think about a random person on the street and have urges to gut them and play with it and cut off their tongue so they won’t scream etc. and I would just laugh at their pain, I have HUGE urges to do them and hear voices saying to & kill them all’ or & grab something sharp and make it count’ and have delusions of me doing them for a split second. I don’t know if this have something to do with it but as a kid I was very angry who seemed calm. When someone would annoy me I would just hurt them out of no where, I wouldn’t have remorse for them when I did this, I would just examine their crying faces and try to see what was happening with them. Almost like they were my lab rats and I was the scientist experimenting. I need help.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Most people do no have the urge to torture people. Generally, people who are unsettled or unhappy have unpleasant thoughts of a wide (mostly negative) variety. You mentioned being a “very angry” child. That would suggest that something bad had happened to you. You didn’t say what made you angry so it’s difficult for me to know. I suspect that it might have been harm done to you by someone in your life.Perhaps the anger from your childhood explains your urges. People often feel the way you do when they are in severe distress or in response to something unpleasant happening (or having happened) in their lives.If you have the opportunity to begin counseling, you should take it. Counseling could help you to control or eliminate these urges by addressing what underlies them. In other words, these thoughts are prompted by something. Counseling could help to uncover what that “something” is, and most importantly, what to do about it. Ask your parents if they will assist you in finding a local therapist. If that’s not an option, speak to the school guidance counselor, social worker or psychologist. They can help you to resolve this problem. Thank you for your question. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Her boyfriend is the real man, he has a car, helped my girlfriend to open a fashion-magazine. I am not rich, I have no car. She says once that she was with me 6 years only by regret!!!

 What you are feeling is deep and abiding grief. You have not only lost your girlfriend, you have lost the life you thought you would have. There is no shame in grieving this very much like one would grieve a death. A six-year relationship where you loved deeply is worth grieving, regardless of what your ex has to say about it. Please give yourself patience and time to honor your loss and figure out what the next chapter of your life will look like. If you are unhappy where you are, think about how to go back home. I hope there are friends there who will embrace you.If you can’t function in your daily life after a few weeks, please consider seeking out a grief counselor or a person of faith to help give you some direction.

From India: I am currently going through a lot of confusion. I became close friends with a girl (Let’s call her G) with whom I shared a deep emotional and intellectual connection even though there was no physical attraction initially. However our emotional intimacy led us to start dating. We dated for a few months and I found G to be an amazing, caring, supportive woman. I found in her a lot of characteristics that I find in my mother. We are very different as individuals in terms of our likes and dislikes but there was a deep bond we both felt.<|im_end|>

 From what you said, this is part of a larger pattern: You either feel passionate about someone you don’t find compatible or you have deep compatibility with someone you can’t allow yourself to find sexually attractive. I think you are right. Your problem isn’t a lack of passion for G, it’s a fear of commitment. After all, if you felt passion for her, you would no longer have any reason not to marry her and make a life together.Please do yourself and G a very big favor and get some therapy to deal with your dilemma. It wouldn’t be fair to her (or to you) to marry her knowing that you aren’t interested in her physically. If you don’t deal with your mental split between compatibility and intimacy, you would probably end up having an affair after marriage. Your wife would feel betrayed. You would feel guilty.

From a teen in the U.S.: I have two irrational subconscious ideas that I need to solve. The first one is I think that people are always watching me.

My mind tells me they are doing this all the time.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It’s not at all unusual for teens to worry excessively about what others think of them. It is not unusual for teens to be self-conscious in social situations or to be shy. It is unusual to think that others are reading your mind. I can’t tell from a letter whether you are a normal kid overthinking your shyness or if you may perhaps be struggling with something like obsessive compulsive disorder. (It’s unlikely that this is psychotic thinking because you do realize that your thoughts about other people reading your mind are irrational.) Whatever the cause, the thoughts are getting in your way and are causing you to suffer much too much.For that reason, I strongly urge you to make an appointment with a mental health counselor. A counselor can hear your whole story and can work with you to sort out whether you simply need some reassurance or if you need some treatment. Bring your letter and this response with you to your first appointment. It will help jumpstart the session.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hi i’m scott i’m 20, engaged and am a calm person i never get into fights and always try to resolve conflict. However I have been severely disturbed by horrendously gross and violent thoughts that really scare me and are like something out of the most horrible horror gore film imaginable. Also in the past I have had socially unacceptable sexual thoughts along with them. I have had these issues for a number of years now but for the past few days they have gotten much worse and I am constatnly anxious over them. I try to control them but if I see something like a knife lying in the kitchen I put it away in the drawer as this can triggger more violent thoughts. I dont want to go into details of these thoughts as i feel they are far too graphic and grotesque. I dont want to have these thoughts and would never act on them but I cant get rid of them and I am worried I will be branded or told I am going insane. I go into daydreams a lot which is when they usually occur and once I have thought them I realise what I have done and feel horrible. Also if I am walking by someone and they whisper to someone else or laugh I get paranoid and feel it is about me. Also I can walk by people and in my mind violent aggressive fictional scenarios play out about this person and me even if they are a stranger as if something inside me is going to make me attack them though I dont want to. It isnt always images as it can also be words coming into my head that distress me.

 Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) could be a possibility. One of the main symptoms of OCD is having negative, repeated thoughts and images of a morbid, violent or sexual nature. Understandably, the content of your thoughts makes you worry, but that is the nature of the disorder.A key element of OCD is that your obsessive thoughts are unwanted. They seem to be repulsive to you and you have a strong desire to eliminate them. They seem to be outside of your control, which further suggests that OCD may be the problem.OCD is an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are easily treatable with psychotherapy and or medication. The sooner you seek treatment, the sooner you can overcome these symptoms.Having an anxiety disorder does not make you “insane.” Millions of people have anxiety disorders and benefit from treatment. Don’t let your fear of being seen as “insane” stop you from seeking help. If you’re willing to seek treatment, and are working with a competent therapist, you should expect a positive outcome.

In the rare event that I hang out with my friends, even for just a few hours, my long distance girlfriend really struggles with it because she has no friends of her own and she is very lonely. Even though I text her the whole time I’m gone she just seems to shut down emotionally and all I can get is one word responses. I’ve shut my friends out of my life more and more over the years because it’s not worth it to me to have her shut down on me. She has suffered from severe depression for many years and I feel like this may be a factor. She describes it as her brain just shutting her down and she doesn’t feel she has control of these feelings. My hope is to get an opinion on what may be causing her to feel this way and what I can do to help her. She has bad anxiety, separation anxiety, and depression and I think that could very well be a factor. I just want to figure out how to try and help her work through this. I would like to be able to see my friends without feeling guilt and sad that she shuts down. It really frustrates me sometimes and I don’t know how to help her.<|im_end|>

  You having to tiptoe around your long-distance girlfriend’s emotions isn’t healthy for you or for her. Limiting your social network and cutting back on seeing your friends because she shuts down will eventually create resentment in you. While it may not be done maliciously it is manipulative. The problems is you can’t be you in the relationship without it throwing her off. Over time this will put you in a terrible position because unless you make her emotional well-being your top priority in life she will have a reaction. This never works because you have to keep restricting yourself in the service of her depression, anxiety, and loneliness.The work here is for you to help her understand she has to figure out how to cope with her reaction. You need to be very supportive of her struggle, but only by explaining that you are not going to not see your friends because it makes her upset. Move toward the conflict by encouraging her to think about what she can do to help herself. The key to this is to set a boundary about what it is you are willing to do for her, and with your help — help her find ways to take responsibility for her emotional well-being.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

 Every psychologist adheres to a code of professional ethics. From what you’ve written, it appears that your psychologist is violating that code. Take a look at: https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/counselor/lpc_ethics.shtm. That code specifically forbids soliciting clients and getting into a dual role. She has become much too entangled with your life.It’s hard for me to imagine any problem that requires 15 years of therapy with sessions of 3 – 8 hours a day as well as weekend visits. Learning how to cope with stress and how to improve the relationship with in-laws is often short term therapy. You are not obliged to accept phone calls that she initiates, much less pay for them. Shopping isn’t therapy. Neither is going to shows you don’t like. The fact that she is asking you to keep her behavior secret is a huge red flag.I suggest you file a complaint with the Board of Registration of Psychologists for your state. Here’s the link to the complaint form and instructions. http://www.tsbep.texas.gov/how-to-file-a-complaint-enforcement. I have limited information. The Board will want to hear your complete story and then will make a determination.I advise you not to tell the therapist that you are filing a complaint. From what you’ve told me, she will make every effort to talk you out of it and probably bill you while she is doing so. A therapist who is doing legitimate work has nothing to fear from a Board investigation.I’m very glad you wrote. I hope you will now take this situation to the Board.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 Occasional nightmares are normal and common but frequent ones, that significantly disrupt your sleep and ability to function, are not. It’s possible that you have an REM sleep disorder. Further evidence of a potential sleep disorder is your sleepwalking and sleep paralysis.Nightmares are also associated with posttraumatic stress disorder, underlying psychological problems, and certain medications: narcotics, barbiturates and alcohol. An evaluation could rule these out as potential causes.I would highly recommend that you undergo a sleep study. Treatment might involve medication and or psychotherapy treatment, depending upon your diagnosis. Psychotherapy might be particularly useful in correcting the psychological aspects of disrupted sleep. Utilize the website sleepeducation.org to find a facility near you or ask your primary care physician for a referral to a sleep specialist.Sleep is an important aspect of psychological health. Without it, it can be difficult to function and maintain a stable mood. Once you have had a sleep study, you will have a better idea about what might be wrong and most importantly, how to treat it. Good luck and please take care.<|im_end|>"

Hello. I have a friend with a very sweet girlfriend. She’s friendly, playful, successful, kind, etc.; however, they have several conflicts due to her behavior in certain situations. I wanted to share a few examples to see how they should proceed (e.g., whether this is a matter for couples counseling or individual therapy).<|im_end|>

You cousin is a bully and is abusive. It doesn’t matter that you are older. He is making your life miserable. I suspect that your grandmother is feeling so overwhelmed by “parenting” again that she can’t see the problems or is coping by trying to ignore them. She seems to be asking you, as the older kid, to do what she can’t. That’s not fair to you. You shouldn’t be asked to control your cousin when she can’t. You shouldn’t be asked to handle this alone.I’m as worried about your cousin as I am about you. It is not usual or normal for a young boy to be behaving like this. I have to wonder what has happened to him that the only way he feels powerful is to be a bully. He is practicing patterns of behavior that are only going to make his life miserable too.I’m so glad you are seeing a counselor. Take your letter and this response to your next appointment. Ask directly for help talking with your grandmother about the effect of your cousin’s behavior and what she intends to do about it. The counselor may be able to direct your grandmother to resources and a counselor who can help the whole family.Hurting yourself won’t solve your problems. Talking to your counselor is likely to help all of you.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From India: I Don’t know what has happened to me suddenly. I used to be curious about life ; things ; had tons of interests..life seemed very bright to me as i’d many dreams too.. but now just all of a sudden i feel so dumb, i’ve no opinions, slow in studies; in fact, i just can’t concentrate in class. I forget even things i have heard 1000 times. I am not able to talk. My brain seems not to work  like a proof, nothing seems to go inside my head-i tend to forget most of the things that the hear or read.<|im_end|>

When someone changes dramatically and without an apparent reason, the first thing to do is to check with a medical doctor to make sure there isn’t an undiagnosed medical issue going on. I don’t think so in this case but it’s always wise to check.I’m wondering if being in college with the much higher academic demands and different social expectations has been overwhelming to you. It is not unusual for young people who excelled in high school to feel swamped in the first year of college where they are no longer the best and the brightest. In college, you are surrounded by other people who were also the best and the brightest in high school. If your self-esteem has been built on being one of the smartest and most interesting people in a room, it can be daunting to find yourself as only one of many people who are also smart and interesting.If that is possibly the case, it’s important to understand it and to set more realistic goals for yourself. You may not get top grades at first. You have to learn a new set of expectations and a new way to manage your studies. If you have difficulty doing that, see if there is a counselor at your school who can help you figure it out.I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

Hello. I’ve seen different psychiatrists over the past few years, and each have different diagnosis (#1 “Can’t say bipolar completely, so depression” #2″Depressive Personality” #3″Depression” #4″Resistant-Treatment Depression” #5(Unknown) #6″Bipolar Depression”).<|im_end|>

 If you videotaped yourself on medication and off medication, you’d see a difference in your personality. This is not to say that medication is either good or bad but it does affect one’s personality.Medication also alters emotional expression. Medication can numb emotions, which can be beneficial in some circumstances but it can also make it difficult to express a full range of emotions.The only way to truly answer the question: “how do I know if I am truly benefitting from the medication?” would be to stop taking your medication for a period of time. I am not recommending such a course of action.I would recommend discussing your thoughts about medication with your psychiatrist. Perhaps he or she would be willing to try decreasing your medication while carefully monitoring your emotions and behavior. It would obviously involve a great deal of careful planning and thought but it might be something to consider. Should you decide to try a decrease, discussions with your psychiatrist should involve planning for what could happen in the event of a psychological emergency.Whatever you decide, it is important to involve both your psychiatrist and your psychologist. Please take care.  <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: Last year, I woke my wife up for sex. This has occurred numerous times throughout our marriage (by both parties) and there was never an issue raised. There were times (when she would wake me and when we were both already awake) when I didn’t want to have sex and never said anything because I didn’t want to disappoint her. Anyway, on the night in question, I unknowingly triggered a flashback to trauma which occurred years before we met that she had never told me about. She did not say or do anything in order to get me to stop. If I had known for even one moment, I would have stopped. It was months later that I even found out it was unwanted. Before and during the assault, I was hurt and felt betrayed by her and also thought I was being petty even feeling betrayed. I know that I should have spoken to her about that instead of trying to replace my negative feelings of her with positive feelings of providing her pleasure.<|im_end|>

I’m heartbroken for both of you. From what you wrote, you have explained, taken responsibility, and apologized. Further, this was apparently a one time event and not a pattern of abusive behavior. Unless there is more to the situation than you were willing to share, I think you aren’t just dealing with what happened one night over a year ago. Sometimes a situation serves as a window to something else that is more difficult and serious. This event may have raised other issues that neither of you have perhaps even been aware of so they haven’t been addressed.You’ve tried to talk together about it to resolve it but have been unsuccessful. It is now undermining your trust and comfort with each other. I urge you to see a couples therapist for a few sessions to get to the root of the problem. If you could have done it on your own, you would have done it already. I’d hate to see a good marriage shattered because of a fundamental misunderstanding that could be corrected.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

How stupid this may sound, it all began with my period. I experienced very heavy cramps during the first one, and got terrible headaches. I couldn’t sleep at night because the pain wouldn’t stop and normal tablets won’t work, the pain is way worse. This took about a week. They told me it were ‘starters problems’. Now, two years later, my period takes two weeks with migraine attacks and pain filled nights. I got stronger tablets, but I can’t do anything once I have those, I just lay in bed.. waiting. When my two weeks of period are over, it takes about a week before it starts again. I don’t know what is wrong with me, but the doctor I visit says I can feel real pain, yet it isn’t there.. because I’ve been through so much pain, my body keeps feeling that pain even though it isn’t really there. I don’t know if he’s right, but I would want to try his therapy, because what other choice do I have because they can’t find anything real wrong with my body? I’m almost not at school anymore, my friends don’t believe me and never call me anymore.. I’m usually alone and I feel empty. It’s the worst for my mom though, now she has one ‘problem’ kid (me), one with ADHD and a jobless husband. I wish we had family to support us, but we don’t.. my mom had a massive fight with her sister and now they don’t talk anymore. Based on what I heard, it’s probably never going to be ok. Sometimes I just think I should end it, or walk away, but then again.. that would probably be really stupid. I don’t know what to do. Besides that, the thought of calling my ‘former friends’ makes me so scared I just want to run away and hide. I have this feeling they talk around my back, bad things like that I just don’t want to go to school or that I’m faking it all. Why would I fake this? I tried explaining a long time ago but they just won’t believe me. Oh, and I have a lot of nightmares lately, about me dying with real pain. What is wrong with me? Please help me.<|im_end|>

 It’s unclear what is wrong but you shouldn’t stop trying to access help. If your mother, the doctor or your friends don’t believe you, then try speaking to school nurses or administrators. Tell them about your symptoms and how it has been a major struggle for you to get help.I’m concerned about the fact that you have considered suicide. Suicidal ideation should always be taken seriously. When you’re not feeling well physically, then you don’t feel well psychologically.It’s important to clarify that you are not a “problem kid” because you’re having a physical problem. It’s not your fault. You did not choose to have a physical problem and if you could eliminate the pain, you would. It’s your mother’s job to take care of you. That’s her role as a parent. You did nothing wrong and you shouldn’t feel as though you did.My recommendation is to continue to ask for help. Ask to see a gynecologist, a doctor who specializes in menstrual health. A specialized physician will likely better understand the nature of your problems. Migraines are very real. There are physicians who specialize in treating only migraines. Migraines can be triggered by hormonal changes in your body, like the ones that occur during your menstrual cycle. An endocrinologist specializes in hormones.Start seeing specialists until your problems are solved. You can talk this over with your primary care physician.If the pain continues, then call emergency services or go directly to the hospital. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 Ok So My Dad Has A BIG Anger Problem. I’m Gonna Tell U Guy About Him And PLEASE Tell Me If He Needs Help Or If Its Not A Big Deal. Ok, So He Is Just So Angry All The Time And He Never Thinks Its His Fault Or Ever Says Sorry. So Some Of The Craziest Things Hes Done Is Throw A Bed At My Sister, Throw A Vacume At Me, Throw A Chair At Me, He Basically Throw’s ANYTHING He Sees. Hes Broken A Ton Of Stuff Like The Button On A Tv, Alot Of Chairs, A Vacume Etc. When He Hits Someone He CANT Stop He’ll Keep Going Untill My Mom Stops Him. Like When We Were Little He Would Chase Us Up The Stairs And Hit Us. He Breaks My Sisters, My Mom, And Me Into Tears ALL The Time. I Always Told Myself That I Wanna Go Somewhere Else And Run Away Or Even Kill Myself Cause I Just DONT Wanna Be With Him. And If Someone Would Talk To Him About It Then He Would Twist Our Words And Blame EVERYTHING On Us. For Example, One Time When We Went To Six flags We Kept Telling Him To Go On A Ride with Us And He Got Mad and Said ” Nobody Wants Me People Just Ignore Me And Dont Care About Me” When We Told Him To Go On A Ride So Obviously We Do Care Bout Him And We Didnt Ignore Him ! I Could Go On And On But I Think This Is Already VERY Long. So Please Help Me And Tell Me Your Opinion And If I’m Just Making A Big Deal Out Of It Or If He Should Really Go To Anger Management. :'(<|im_end|>

 No kid should ever have things thrown at them. No kid should be hit or live in fear of her own father. I’m worried that at some point your dad won’t know how to stop and you (or your mother or sister) will be really, really hurt. So – yes, your dad does have a big problem but it would probably be dangerous for you to be the one to tell him so. I have no reason to think that he would have a calm discussion with you about his behavior.Unfortunately, it sounds like your mother is as afraid of him as you are. Instead of protecting you girls, she breaks into tears. She needs some help too. It might help if you, your mom, and your sister had a serious talk together about what to do. You can’t change your dad. He isn’t interested in changing. But it’s possible you could all get away to a safe place until he gets himself into some counseling and learns how to control himself.Support your mom in checking into options for practical help and support. There is a 24-hour crisis line in your city for families like yours. Also check out this website. Everyone in your family deserves so much better.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hi, I’m 21 years old. I’ve been smoking marijuana almost on a daily basis for something close to a year, and in a much less amount before that (once or twice a month or so.) Back to last years winter, I started having a lot of problems and my life started to crumble down in a psychological way. I started being really insecure, and having paranoid thoughts about society excluding me. I tried to quit after new years, but I’ve been smoking again recently. The thing is I’ve found so many benefits in smoking, like a very incresed creativity, more relaxed state of mind sometimes, a little bit greater maturity, etc. But I’ve also experienced a lot of social insecurities. I’ve been knowing my best friends for years, but lately I’ve felt a little bit apart from them. They currently don’t know about this habit of mine, because I feel maybe they would see me as a drug addict or something similar. And even though I see them really often, and we have great moments, I’ve always felt unsure about many things related to myself around them. And around other people. I don’t know if maybe they know that I smoke, and don’t want to tell me, or if they exclude me sometimes without me realizing it. I also forget many things all the time, my memory has gone far away from me. But not even all of this has been enough for me to decide to quit smoking. I always think “Nah, they’re just crazy thoughts…”, and continue doing it. I really need help, I feel like I’m losing myself at some point. Please. I would really appreciate it<|im_end|>

 It’s difficult to know how much your drug use is contributing to your psychological problems, but make no mistake it is a factor. People use drugs for a variety of reasons. The main one, not wanting to think about or deal with their problems. Some people don’t know how to fix their psychological problems but they know they feel bad and using drugs is one way to ease the pain. In essence you may be self medicating. In the short term, numbing one’s emotions feels good but in the long run, it only makes their situation worse.Your drug use is impacting you in a number of negative ways, including eroding your memory, increasing your paranoia and anxiety levels, and an overall diminishing in the quality of your life.Drug use is dangerous. I receive letters on a regular basis from people asking for help because they smoked marijuana and are now experiencing anxiety, disassociation, derealization, and depersonalization. Do a Google search for those terms and their connection to marijuana use and you will find many cases of people reporting these types of very unpleasant and frightening experiences.Many people underestimate the potential dangerousness of marijuana. It is a hallucinogenic drug. The most dangerous aspect of illegal drug use is not knowing what you’re getting. There is no quality control for drugs bought on the streets. They can be laced with any number of poisons, some of which could be deadly.You described your drug use as a habit, but at this point it seems more than a habit. Being unable to quit may indicate addiction. It would be wise for you to seek professional help. Mental health professionals are trained to deal with these types of problems. An important goal of counseling is to teach clients problem-solving skills so they can make positive life choices that lead to a better life.You can get a referral to a mental health professional from your primary care physician or by clicking the “find help” tab at the top of this page. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 You’ve done impressive work conquering your anxiety. I hope you give yourself lots of credit for that.The situation you describe does make a kind of sense. You successfully compartmentalized your anxiety into the part of yourself that speaks your native language. When you shift into English, it’s as if you liberate yourself from old negative experiences and the behaviors that were a result.I want you to know that this isn’t unusual. Many people happen on this technique as a way to make significant changes. It’s as if speaking a different language provides psychological permission to be different.Now it’s time to generalize all you’ve learned to your native language. You’ve already had success with CBT. I suggest that you go back to the therapist and discuss how best to do that.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hello, I’m 20 years old just had my first baby and I’ve been struggling what i thought was depression and severe anxiety since I was 12. I’ve tried every depression medication was on medication to help me sleep (which is another issue) and for my anxiety and nothing has seemed to work for me. I stopped talking all medication when i was 17 and shortly after stated medicating myself. I did this for about 2 years and stopped completely on my own then found out i was pregnant. I then got on depression medication again because i did not want to live that life style anymore. I really don’t believe depression is my problem i don’t want to harm myself or anything like that i’m more manic then anything and you can never tell which way i’m going to be that day or that hour even. Sometimes i’ll be fine for days other times it’s only hours you never know, so when i’m at my high and everythings fine i know that the low is going to follow and that frustrates me. My anxiety is very bad and i have attacks even when i’m laying down to sleep. My heart will pound my vision will shake, my chest will hurt, and i’ll feel as though i have a lump in my throat. Theres no reason for this to happen to me when all i’m doing is sleeping. When I’m going somewhere i’ve never been or going to be around alot of people it gets very bad as well and i usually get diarrhea with all those symptoms. I don’t want to live like this anymore I went and tried to get in with my dr. to try and get on a medication that’s right for me and unfortunately i can’t been seen till the 15 of july. I can’t wait that long I try to be as normal as i can for i’m the only one taking care of my 8 week old son right now. I’m able to function enough to take care of him. I’m not sure what i need to do to get in with someone faster to start me on the right medication. Could you please tell me what your opinion is on my condition and how i could go about gettting help faster. I live in florida by the way.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 The symptoms you have described including: heart palpitations, shakiness, chest pains, feeling as though you have a lump in your throat, severe anxiety, and diarrhea seem consistent with a panic attack or panic disorder. Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder.Another possibility is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS is a medical condition commonly associated with stress and anxiety. You also reported having a history of depression and possibly mania, a symptom of bipolar disorder.It is difficult to provide an accurate diagnosis over the Internet. My recommendation is to have both a psychiatric evaluation and a medical evaluation. The latter is important to rule out the presence of physical health problems.You have an appointment to see a doctor but you can’t be seen until July 15th. You did not specify which type of doctor you plan to see. If you would like to be seen sooner, call the doctor’s office and inform them of your concerns. You could also make an appointment with a different doctor. A different doctor might be able to better accommodate your needs.I would also recommend making an appointment with a mental health professional. This could be with a psychiatrist or a therapist, or both. Psychiatrists can prescribe medication but therapists cannot. A therapist can provide talk therapy. If you have not tried talk therapy, you should. Medication alone is often not a comprehensive approach to treatment. In most cases, treatment for mental health disorders requires both therapy and medication. I hope this answer helps you to decide how best to proceed. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I have been unhappily married for 11 years. I basically married the wrong person. We have 2 boys. I thought my husband represented all I wanted from life. My sex life consisted of all give and no take before. I had no intimacy with my husband, he was gone all week and only home on the weekends only to be miserable and grouchy and very non-intimate, but expected sex every night he was home and blatantly told me at the beginning of our relationship that sex was a very important part of a marriage.<|im_end|>

I too am very, very sorry you have lived such a difficult life for such a long time. However, that doesn’t justify your current situation. I think you and your brother are mistaking relief and the excitement of doing the forbidden for love. You have both been deeply unhappy so it makes a kind of sense that you would each fall for someone who understands your pain.But – Your lover is your half brother, 10 years younger, and a father. You are married and a mother. You are both longing for family and connectedness but there are too many differences and obstacles to overcome to make this work over the long haul. Most important, at least three children are going to be deeply affected if you and your brother try to live together as a couple. If you stay in your town, the kids will have to bear taunting and shame. If you keep your secret by moving everyone away, they will be wrenched from their security. (You do realize that relatives and friends will eventually figure things out so the kids will find out anyway.)That doesn’t mean you should stay with an abusive husband. It does sound like all he is doing now is too little, much too late. You are not obligated to forgive him. You certainly shouldn’t forget how he treats people when he takes them for granted. It could be that this time with your brother has been a much needed boost so that you could finally think about the divorce you’ve been too afraid to consider without a safety net.Now that you’ve taken the step of asking for a divorce, you need to use your personal counselor to help you find the courage and strength to make a life for you and your kids on your own — not to indulge in fantasies about a forbidden love that will wreck so many lives. I hope your counselor hasn’t gotten so caught up in feeling sorry for your pain that she isn’t able to see the larger picture and give you the support you need to move forward.<|im_end|>"

Should i cut the relationship off to appease my parents and family?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 No, you shouldn’t cut off the relationship. At 32, you have the right to make your own decisions. But I do think you need to walk in your family’s shoes a little. Love is driving their behavior. They’ve watched you make the same mistakes time and again. They are protective of you. They are protective of your kids. They don’t know your new guy the way you do. How do they know he isn’t the same type of “mistake” in another disguise? Six months isn’t very long to know each other before making the decision to make a life together. From their point of view, it may look like you are again acting on impulse.I wish your family members were able to be kinder in expressing their concern but being angry at them for being concerned will only keep this going. Instead, think about how to help your family and your boyfriend get to know each other. This isn’t going to be accomplished with one awkward meeting. It will mean arranging for various people in your family to spend time with the two of you and your kids. Keep it light. Find ways to have fun, not confrontations. When they see that he’s a good man and that he’s good to you, chances are they will accept him.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I was a neglected child.  No caring parent.  Some physical abuse but treated as nothing.  I was nothing. I was hit, not fed properly, never touched. No I love yous or encouragement In highschool I reached out to say I was abused but it got exaggerated.  I found the only way to be heard was to agree when asked if I was being sexually abused. I was removed by the protective services. I was abused but not this way. I have nobody and not sure if I did this to myself or? Family chooses not to believe or support. So i haven’t had family since leaving 25 years ago  My family was not a good unit with all sibling leaving in their teens to runaway from home. I just feel like a bad person even though I know the place was awful.  It was pure neglect and feeling unloved.  I thought in telling I would get this but it doesn’t work that way.  Nobody loves me I feel lost and confused.  I feel unsure of who I am.  I did come from an abusive home but nobody had been listening when I only spoke of the yelling and neglect and the hitting. Nobody wanted to help.  They said it was awful but I was alone. I wanted someone to make it stop. I needed someone to care for me.  I wanted a real family. Am I mentally ill for doing this?  I am very rational and I know it was wrong but in the end it didn’t matter anyways. (From Canada)<|im_end|>

  Abuse is abuse — and you did what you needed to do to get yourself out of there. Sadly, the protective systems have huge gaps and problems, and when you weren’t being listened to you spoke to them in a language that got you away from people who were, indeed, abusive.I think it would be time to have both individual and group therapy. I know this may sound daunting, but the truth is the family you were born into didn’t have the skills to care for your properly. The cornerstone of group therapy is the correction of the initial family dynamics. I would look for a good therapist in your area that specializes in group therapy. They will be familiar with this process and help you use the group to rebuild your faith in people, and yourself.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

  While I can understand the concern, the research shows us another picture of aging. It tends to be that older people are happier and feel less of the anxiety that is associated with younger ages. While every age has its challenges, longitudinal research shows that if you are dynamic when you are young, if you have a good temperament earlier in life, you will tend to be dynamic with a good temperament in later years. In fact one of the most dramatic studies on the relationship to temperament and health and happiness is the so-called Nun Study. If you have any questions about aging and quality of life going forward this study should answer them.Finally, what we do know is that worrying too much about the future robs you of the attention you need to flourish in the moment. Concentrate on the life you are living now — and it will keep rewarding you as you mature.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

 Your boyfriend is not well. He’s clearly struggling and needs help. I’m not certain what your relationship is like with his parents but I would urge you to share this information with them as soon as possible.What about your parents? Are they aware of the information that your boyfriend has shared with you? If not, then you should tell them.You should also consider reporting this information to a local mental health crisis team or the police. Calling the police or a mental health crisis team will ensure that he receives immediate help. Emergency services will come to the home, evaluate his condition and determine if he needs treatment.Take his threats seriously and report them immediately. He is not well, not thinking clearly, can’t control his behavior, and is in need of help. You may worry that he will be upset with you because you shared this information with others. He may feel as though it is a breach of trust but I would urge you to report it anyway. What’s most important is protecting his safety and the safety of others. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 Thank you for sending us your email. I deeply appreciate the description of your journey. And I think your physician will, too. He is in the best position to help because he knows your history, understands the meds and, as a professional, knows the course the process of healing can take.It might seem hard to believe but the embarrassment and hesitation to talk to him may actually be part of the depression that has set back in. The part of you that found the courage to send this letter is the part that you believe in — and your physician believes it.If it is too difficult to do on your own, ask a friend or family member to go with you. This may help cushion the initial meeting.But if this still isn’t okay you can bring your concerns to a new psychiatrist. Explain your history, the measures taken, and where you are at now, and he or she should be able to help.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I am currently 17 and a junior in high school. I am in dire need of medicine to treat my mental illness. I’ve been diagnosed with severe OCD and it’s truly taking control of my life. The anxiety I get from it has changed me completely and I can’t do anything I used to. I have intense intrusive thoughts that keep me up every night (I haven’t slept yet, it’s 8am on the dot and I’m really unable to sleep) and sometimes the thoughts go as far that I think about harming myself or worse.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m concerned that you are so focused on getting medicine for the OCD that you aren’t looking at the whole picture.Yes, you may be a “hormonal” teen, but that doesn’t mean that your distress should go ignored. The first stop should be with your regular doctor to make sure your hormone levels are normal and that you are generally healthy. Some of what you are reporting could be caused by endocrine issues.Do also talk with your doctor about your sleep disorder. It may be more important than you think. You can find information about how to normalize your sleep cycle on the Internet. Do your best to follow recommendations and get yourself back into a regular sleep pattern. I have a guess that doing so will help calm down the OCD at least a little.Since you have been diagnosed with OCD, I’m assuming that a qualified mental health counselor did the diagnosing. Return to that professional for help in developing a treatment plan and in talking with your parents. Meanwhile, there are a number of excellent self-help books available that can help you learn to manage the obsessional thinking. Go to Amazon or Barnes and Noble and search for a title that appeals to you.Finally, you are much too isolated. Frequent moves and attending school online means you are not having the experiences that most teens need to emotionally grow. Your mom may be right that you need to “get out of yourself” but that is difficult to do when your only social outlet is with you!Online relationships can be satisfying but they are not the same as participating in the social environment that school offers. You need a few best girl friends to talk to about your experiences, to normalize at least some of what you are going through, and to share laughs, fun times, music, and hanging out as well as mutual support.I think you need to go back to school! Yes, you have moved a lot. But, as other kids who are frequent movers will tell you, you can see that as a plus, not just a minus. You have the chance to make friends in lots of places. You have interesting experiences to share with new people. You can develop an ease with doing new things and meeting new people that will serve you well as an adult. It may be scary at first, but put on your big girl pants and get out there! Getting more social experience now will help prepare you for when you finish school and go on to a job or college.Six months may seem like a long time. But it seems to me to be about the amount of time you need to follow the recommendations I’ve made. If you are still suffering from significant OCD, you will no longer need your folks’ permission to make an appointment with a psychiatrist.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 If you don’t care about whether you live or die, then maybe you are not as happy as you say you are. Happy people want to live. They value life.You state that you are not planning to end your life, but if it ended you would not care. You might be describing passive suicidal ideation. Passive suicidal ideation is indicative of depression. Depression is a symptom of unhappiness. It suggests that something might be wrong and needs to be changed.An alternative view is that you are taking your good fortunes in life for granted. If everything has gone well for you and you’ve never experienced loss or suffering, then perhaps you don’t realize your fortune.I’m reminded of an Abraham Maslow quote about taking life for granted. Abraham Maslow studied psychologically healthy people and wrote about their characteristics. He thought that people would be more satisfied with their lives if they had gratitude for their everyday blessings such as freedom, physical health and economic well-being. He was “…convinced that getting used to our blessings is one of the most important nonevil generators of human evil, tragedy, and suffering. What we take for granted we undervalue…” Sometimes people only appreciate the true value of what they had after it’s gone, when it is too late.It would be good to explore this problem with a mental health professional. Counseling could help you understand why you feel the way that you do. You also mentioned disordered eating but did not elaborate. Eating disorders are dangerous. Disordered eating is also a sign of discontentment. If something is wrong, then it’s important to correct it so you can have a joyful life. Counseling could help you achieve that goal. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: My husband and I have been together for 9 yrs, married 5 of those years. When we first got together my boys were 7 and 5yrs old and they got along. A year later we moved in together and my boys could nothing right in his eyes. It wasn’t THAT bad so I told myself it would take time.Every year got worse and not better! I still tell myself it getbetter someday but I think now it will only get worse.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
One possible explanation for your husband’s behavior is that he has never accepted the fact that you had a life before him. He may see your boys’ existence as a constant reminder that you were once with someone else. He hasn’t embraced his position as an important role model for your kids or as a partner in parenting with you. Instead, he seems to want only to control the kids and make them miserable. The result is that your boys are living in a terrorist environment where they suffer daily psychological abuse. It’s a wonder the kids haven’t turned into the “thugs” he imagines them to be. I certainly hope that the boys’ father offers them a counter-model of manhood and gives them the love and respect they deserve.I’m sure there are people who disagree with me but I do believe that a mother’s first loyalty belongs with her children. Your kids deserve your protection as well as your love. I think you owe it to the boys to get them out of this situation. If it’s an option, you could agree to let them live with their father full time while they finish high school and arrange to visit them in public places or while on vacations. If that’s not possible, you have some difficult decisions to make. To save your kids, you may have to leave the man. Your love for your husband may be clouding your own good judgment. Trust your instincts. Your fears about the future are probably correct. Why would your boys ever want to subject themselves to more of this? Why would you want them to?I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hello, I have been dating my current girlfriend for about 2 years now. She currently lives with me for the past 2 months. I live at home with my widowed mom. My main issue is my girlfriend does not want to be around my family or go to family events. She comes from a cold family that does not get along well. I come from a warm loving family. She tells me she feels uncomfortable around them. She thinks they are Judgmental. I tried reassuring her they are not. Her biggest line is “I am not married or engaged to you, I don’t have to be close to them”. This bothers me and gives me concerns if she is the right one for me. I take in consideration she isn’t close to her family, but I think she is over-reacting. I had to leave her at my house to go to 3 family events already. I am wondering if I should move on or not. I am 30 years old with a good job and responsible. She is currently out of work, in the process of getting a certificate in billing medical assistant. I do alot of nice things for her, pay for her school course, etc. What should I do. I dont’ want to avoid my family just because she thinks its not necessary to be around them. This is the first g/f I’ve dated who does this… :(. Any help with be appreciated!!! Today my sister is coming over with her family for dinner and my girlfriend does not want to be here for it. I’m tired of hiding for her :(.<|im_end|>

The key to understanding what to do is in her answer to you: “I am not married or engaged to you, I don’t have to be close to them.” Let’s take a look at what this means.If she is living with you and says the reasons she won’t be with your family are that she isn’t married or engaged to you, does that mean that she will be fine with them when she is? Unlikely. It seems she is using it as a way to validate her reluctance.The other possibility is that she is completely telling you the truth about how she feels. Since she is not engaged or married she feels no obligation. Since her feeling about your family is clear, she is telling you there are very clear limits on the depth she is willing to be involved with you.I recommend couples counseling for the two of you to get this issue on the table. If she is unwilling to do this, or can’t evolve from her current position, it may be time to rethink the relationship.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

 It’s possible that you are experiencing side effects from your medication. The dosage may need adjusted. It’s common to need medication adjustments.If it’s not the medicine, then you might be describing disassociation or symptoms of depersonalization/derealization disorder. Individuals with that disorder often feel detached from their surroundings or their bodies. They often describe feeling as though they are in a dream or that they are observing their life rather than living their life. They feel a certain level of detachment from their bodies and their surroundings. It’s unclear what causes these symptoms but they are common among people with trauma histories. Drug use is also associated with depersonalization and derealization.I would encourage you to discuss your symptoms with your therapist and your prescribing physician. A medication adjustment or additional medication might relieve the symptoms. Continued psychotherapy can also help. A trauma-focused therapist can treat symptoms of disassociation, if that’s what the problem is. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I left my verbally abusive husband a year and a half ago. Through that time I had given him chances to make changes and get some help. He had made slight changes in regards to the time he wanted to spend with the family but that’s about it. I guess you can say we both gave up a few months ago and I moved on. I recently started dating someone and that is when things changed. My ex checked himself into a psychiatric hospital and has since gone on his much needed medicine. He is like a new person and finally saying everything I’ve ever wanted to hear. He doesn’t blame me for the issues any more and actually admits to the manipulation and abuse. It’s clear that this time is different and he has had some realizations about his behavior in the past and how important our son and I are too him, my questions is can I change now? Can I learn to trust him and not think everything is a manipulation. Can I not worry that saying the wrong thing will make him snap? It’s just so hard, I want to believe he has changed and I know this time is very different but is this a last effort to control the situation. He is not pressuring me to jump back into a relationship, he just wants to show me he has changed and in order to show me I have to break up with the new guy because it wouldn’t be fair to anyone involved. It’s also really hard to end it with the new guy because he is nice and things are so relaxed, the opposite of what I just came from. I just don’t want to make the wrong decision. I don’t know how it got so bad the first time around, I felt like I just woke up in this deep pit and I’m afraid of that happening again and if it did I know I would not have the support from family or friends the second time around. I guess my real question is can he really change for good? Can I change and truly be myself? And are there any programs or something I can suggest he/I be involved in to help our success? I like this new guy he makes me feel good about myself but I also really want to have a happy family and not share time with my son. It’s truly hard to think about letting either one of them go. I really think I’m leaning towards the ex but can’t even imagine what that would look like when all my friends and family hate him. All I ever wanted him to do was make theses changes and see things differently, how can I now walk away?<|im_end|>

 Go slow. It is wonderful to hear of all the changes that your husband has made. But let’s review the process. You have been separated for a year and a half and it came about because there weren’t significant sustainable changes. Now that you have started dating, your husband has been highly motivated. The question really is whether he is motivated for you or for him? Only time can answer this question. It is for too early to think about reconciliation, although a couple months is a very very good start. But that’s all it is.It doesn’t sound like you have any big decision that needs to be forced. I would be sure to tell your new boyfriend about the struggle and don’t try to hide anything from your ex. In other words, get on with your life and see what evolves. If you see sustainable changes after a year or so with your husband, it may be something to reconsider. But before that amount of time has gone by I wouldn’t use a couple of months as the best indicator that the change will be long-lasting and something he’s doing for himself.As you sort through this I would highly recommend individual therapy. The find help tab at the top of the page should help you find a local therapist in your area. You’ve taken a long time to make the decision to leave. Give yourself the opportunity to view this process with your husband from a distance. You don’t want to jump back in too soon.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

When i was very young we were burgled whilst me, my parents and brother were in the house at night. After this event i had huge difficulty sleeping and became very anxious of being home alone and sleeping in a room on my own. I was even too scared to go across to my parents bedroom for comfort. I often have to go to sleep with the television on.<|im_end|>

 I disagree. I think this is an awful problem. You shouldn’t resign yourself to living a life in fear. You have every right to be furious with the burglars who stole your peace of mind. You have every right to want a life that isn’t dominated by memories of a traumatic event that happened almost a decade ago.I know the therapy at the time wasn’t helpful. But please don’t write off therapy. It could be that you and the thereapist weren’t a good “fit” or that your little-girl self wasn’t able to take full advantage of treatment. Look for a therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress. A therapist can help you come to terms with what happened and learn new ways to strengthen your ability to cope with life’s challenges.I also suggest you take a look at David Burns’s book, “Feeling Good.” He talks about ways to manage overwhelming anxiety in part of the book.I wish you well.

Hello, please help! I am a 48 year old male, married with kids. I have always had some degree of anxiety (a worrier), usually very minor but with all the stressors I’ve endured lately (double job loss, part time business failure), I believe it has accelerated to an OCD condition – I have a fear of hazardous material, and in particular asbestos and the diseases it causes. My fear is heightened when I think my family may be exposed as well. I’ve had this fear (to a much lesser extent) for quite some time since learning the horrors of contracting mesothelioma, but it has seemed to peak – I can take the thoughts to the extreme as described below.<|im_end|>

 Though I cannot provide a diagnosis over the Internet, your symptoms seem indicative of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is an anxiety disorder that is characterized by unwanted, reoccurring thoughts and repetitive behaviors.Among OCD sufferers, specifically among those with health-related anxieties such as yours, often no amount of reassurance is enough. In fact, the act of seeking reassurance can make OCD worse. It temporarily decreases anxiety but it reinforces the “seeking reassurance” behavior.OCD sufferers should resist the urge to seek reassurance and instead endure their anxiety. If an individual habitually seeks reassurance when they feel anxious, then not doing so will increase their anxiety, possibly to very intense levels.Those levels cannot be sustained. Anxiety always decreases. In that way, anxiety can be likened to the law of gravity: what goes up must come down. Individuals with OCD are unwilling to endure their anxiety. They do everything in their power to escape it. That is a mistake. Anxiety avoided in the short run is only intensified in the long run.As you stated, “I know the odds of an illness are very remote, and exposure and illness are essentially out of my control.” It is generally believed that individuals with OCD, through their rituals, are attempting to establish control over events and situations that in reality they cannot control.You can reduce or eliminate your anxiety by focusing on reality. If you force yourself to believe in reality, then your anxiety will diminish.Beginning therapy was a very wise choice. I would strongly urge you to continue. Therapy can help you to understand and to be comfortable with things that are beyond your control. This wisdom has been shared by mankind since the beginning of recorded history and perhaps before. It is exemplified in the Serenity Prayer, (adopted by Alcoholics Anonymous) “God, grant us the Serenity to accept things we cannot change, Courage to change the things we can, and the Wisdom to know the difference…”OCD tends to be a progressive disorder but this is not true for everyone. Symptoms may occur on certain occasions or on all, decrease over time or increase. There are effective treatments for OCD including cognitive-behavioral therapy and relaxation training. A specific form of cognitive-behavioral therapy, known as exposure and prevention response, has been shown to be a very effective treatment. Medication can help as well.I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.  <|im_end|>"

I’m a 19 year-old female college student and am currently at a very distressing point in my life. Over the past several months I’ve managed to fail just about all my classes, although I plan to take the summer off as my family insists it would be beneficial for me to do so. I have also begun to withdraw socially from just about everyone except my boyfriend, due to a constant fear that no one understands me (it’s as if they’re all on a different planet and I feel so isolated and alone) however when a friend does try to reach out to me I immediately feel irritated while talking to them (ex: I vented to a friend earlier today and all they had to say was “Life doesn’t wait for anyone” so I immediately wanted to find a sledgehammer, jump out the window, run to their place of residence, and bash their head in with it). Intense emotional responses have never been foreign to me as I suspect that I suffer from bipolar disorder and many other mood-altering disorders as well, but it’s still distressing when it happens. Furthermore, I’ve been constantly paranoid for months, well all my life really, but it’s gotten especially bad within the past several months in that I have recurring thoughts that there are cameras everywhere and whenever I do see cameras my thoughts start to spiral, but I’m able to compose myself for the most part. I seem to be quite disorganized (ex: forgetting to put on certain articles of clothing, forgetting to eat, never cleaning my room because zero motivation to do so, or to do anything for that matter, forgetting everything I read directly after I read it, etc.) my boyfriend has noticed my behavior and mannerisms and claims I seem paranoid and talk in a very rushed manner and eyes wide and looking around everywhere (told him to not let me spend any money under any circumstances because I’ll need it for something). I also have a tendency to lose my train of thought always. Then there’s hallucinations such as seeing yetis on my way home at nights and every time I hear a bunch of people talking it gets distorted and I can’t make sense of it, constant brain chatter, etc. which again, aren’t new at all, just more prevalent than before. Just nothing ever feels… right.<|im_end|>

 I cannot provide a diagnosis on the basis of a letter. You mentioned a variety of symptoms but without conducting a personal interview, it’s difficult to know if they constitute a disorder. Generally speaking, the main problem seems to be your untreated symptoms.I would recommend undergoing an evaluation with a mental health professional. For a variety of reasons, many people wait to seek help. One recent statistic indicated that some people wait 10 years before they seek help for their mental health problems. Waiting makes it worse.Acknowledging your symptoms is a good first step. The next step is to seek treatment. Once you undergo an assessment, you will have clarity about what might be wrong. At that point, a treatment plan will be created. It will be designed to meet your needs and goals. Your symptoms are highly treatable with medication and therapy. But if ignored, they will continue to disrupt your life. Don’t needlessly suffer with treatable symptoms.Ask your parents or your boyfriend to assist you in finding a local therapist. Once you begin treatment, you will feel relief. Maybe then you can return to school (if you want) without the interference of troublesome symptoms. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 Thank you for your email. I think you can get closure without having to talk to him directly again. The method is through expressive writing. I would write him a letter that is complete with all your thoughts, feelings and reactions. Don’t hold anything back. Expressive writing is one way to organize, express, and integrate our feelings when we need closure. It is safe — when you write the letter I would focus on both what you received in the relationship that was good, and what your disappointments were that diminished it and ultimately ended it. This will help you find more of what you want and less of what you don’t in your future relationships. Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

 A: What you are describing is an intense episode of masculine/feminine HOCD. In this form of OCD a person’s perception of masculinity or femininity is very sterotypical. Any deviation from the stereotype in a person’s thinking (and most of us do deviate) sets off the OCD.CBT Theapy is generally thought to be the therapy intervention of choice for this situation. It helps a person deal with their distorted beliefs around gender and teaches tools for stopping the thoughts.At 14, it’s normal to be asking questions about your sexuality. Unfortunately, the form your questioning is taking is making you miserable. CBT will help you get back to the normal teen exploration of who you are.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I can only imagine how painful it is for you to be separated from your son and your grandchildren in this way. But you are correct: Your daughter-in-law is not solely at fault. Your son is allowing this situation to exist. Although it is certainly appropriate for him to put his own family first in many ways, there is no reason for him to do so at the expense of your relationship with him and his children — and his wife.His wife is apparently asking him to choose between her and his family of origin. This is generally a disastrous demand. No one should have to choose between the people he loves and the people who love him. Such a separation often eventually erodes the marriage.You have ended up putting him in the same bind his wife did. Telling him to leave you alone until he can behave differently only deprives you of seeing him.I suggest that you bide your time. Love him as best you can. Let him know how much you miss seeing him and his family. Repeat that you are prepared to love his wife as well — and mean it. As Michelle Obama said in her convention speech, “When someone goes low, go high.” You will feel better about yourself and you leave an opening for your son to reconnect at some point.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My therapist, a psychologist, is scaling back his practice as he nears retirement. Because of my difficult insurance provider and my lack of progress — decline even — during the 8 years I’ve been going to therapy with him, he says I need to find another counselor. My options are not bountiful in this mid-sized Bible Belt town. After going to treatment for so very long with so little improvement, I feel weary of therapy and no longer hope it can help me feel any better about my life. I’ve been depressed and suicidal since my separation and divorce 10 years ago, which was a traumatic end to a dramatic and painful relationship. I have had to stay and live in my ex-husband’s hometown as my children finish school. Career options have been very limited here, and even professional jobs are very low-paying, so staying and living in this community for my children’s sake has been a huge personal sacrifice that will affect my standard of living until I die, which I hope will be sooner rather than later. I’ve been hospitalized three times during the past decade and have been diagnosed with PTSD and GAD. My family physician thinks I am bipolar, but my psychologist doesn’t agree. I don’t know. I have become an atheist during the past decade, but I live in a radically conservative town. Many of the counselors here were trained at one of the three evangelical universities here, and I don’t relish interviewing for a new therapist. Despite all the unhealthful habits I’ve dropped, I’m more miserable than ever. I spend weekends in bed crying. I have no motivation or inspiration to create any short-term or long-term goals. Indeed, after 10 years of life as a divorced woman and mother, I still cannot find any hobbies or purposeful goals to replace the broken dream of marriage and family. I am slow to trust people. In fact, after 8 years with my current therapist, I’ve still haven’t been able to talk to him about the things that happened during my marriage. I dread the long slog of building trust with another counselor, but I do worry that I would commit suicide if I don’t see pursue treatment of some kind. I don’t want to damage my children, and my youngest child is just entering high school. I would prefer to wait until he is grown to kill myself. Or, perhaps, too much rumination and therapy has made me more miserable? Maybe I need a break?   I cannot stress enough how limited my options are in this place. Health care of all types is tough, especially specialists. It’s too far (3 hours) to any large cities, by the way, or I would commute to a therapist.  <|im_end|>

A: I’m sorry that things have not improved for you over the years and hope that you can find the right combination of treatment and self-help techniques to improve your condition. I’m surprised that your current psychologist didn’t give you some recommendations for a new therapist. If he hasn’t, this is where I suggest that you start because he knows your clinical picture and might be able to steer you toward someone in your community who might work well with you. Otherwise, I checked a few therapist referral sites, and though the results are limited, there are some options. I would suggest that you first get a list of approved providers from your insurance company then cross reference that with the “find a therapist” links on sites like Psych Central and Psychology Today. This way, you can read their profiles first to see if you feel there might be a good match. Building trust might not take as long as you think if you click with someone quickly. In my experience, even Christian counselors are trained to respect the beliefs of their client and typically do not bring these issues into therapy unless it is wanted. But I encourage you to voice your concerns up front in the screening process. If you cannot find a local therapist whom you feel that you can work with, you might look for someone who does counseling over the phone or via video conferencing. You might even look into a certified life coach for this reason.The other thing that strikes me about your post is that you have not made significant improvement during your years in therapy. However, you also admit that you have not shared some of the important details of your life with your therapist. We can only work with the information we are given, so I would suggest that you be brazenly honest in your next therapeutic experience. It is the only way to get better. I would also suggest that you get a thorough medical evaluation, including blood work, because sometimes there can be underlying physical problems. Here’s a good Psych Central article on this topic: “6 Conditions that Feel Like Clinical Depression but Aren’t.” The other thing that I would recommend is to broaden your treatment approach. I have personally received good results by taking a holistic approach to therapy and incorporating all sorts of techniques, such as EMDR, EFT, and guided imagery. I also collaborate with other types of providers such as massage therapists, energy workers, and acupuncturists. I typically encourage clients to practice meditation (and/or prayer), regular exercise and other self-help activities such as support groups, yoga, and reading books geared toward your own personal struggles. You are ultimately responsible for your healing journey and if what you have done in the past isn’t working, try some new approaches.Finally, I sincerely hope that you will work tirelessly on getting better so that you do not leave this world through suicide. I have seen firsthand the devastation suicide brings to a family, especially the children of the departed (and it doesn’t matter if they are adult children). You obviously love your children very much and have made sacrifices for them. The best thing you can do now is find a way to get better so that you can enjoy the rest of your years. You have suffered enough, now it is time to live.All the best,<|im_end|>"

 I am glad that you took the time to write about your concerns. You have a sense that something is wrong and I think you may be correct.You also described “watching from the sidelines” and on some occasions having conversations with imaginary people. Conversing with imaginary people may be a hallucination, which is a symptom associated with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. It might also be a manifestation of your extreme loneliness.Without being able to interview you in person to gather details about your potential symptoms, it is difficult to know what may be wrong.Someone told you that you have schizophrenia. Based on what you have described, depression may be a more realistic possibility.It would be interesting to know who that “someone” was who believes you have schizophrenia. Is he or she a mental health professional? If not, then it may be best to devalue their opinion.My two biggest concerns are your refusal to see a doctor and your belief that you cannot speak to your family about these issues. With regard to accessing help, you have eliminated the very people who are there to help you. These issues should not be ignored; they should be brought to the attention of a mental health professional. You are clearly suffering. You should not rule out the opportunity to receive help.Even though you are reluctant to seek help, you should do so anyway. Are there school counselors or mental health professionals available to students on your campus? Most colleges have professional mental health services that are available to students free of charge. I would strongly advise that you utilize those services.You stated that you have been trying to “figure out” what’s wrong but were unsuccessful. Mental health professionals are trained to deal with these types of issues. Use their expert guidance to assist you in dealing with psychological problems; that is their job. I hope that you will take my advice and seek professional help. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From the UK: Hi, Recently I’ve noticed my partner has been really moody and down so today I asked how he is. I got the same response as usual, which is that he can’t really describe it, stuff is getting caught up with his issues and because we had been arguing a lot lately.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I don’t understand what he’s talking about either. I also don’t understand why you are in this relationship. From what you wrote, it doesn’t sound like he is contributing equally to the practical aspects of life (laundry, paying his electricity, etc.). You mention nothing about feeling loved, cherished, or supported for who you are.Instead of working on improving your communication, your boyfriend confuses you and denies personal responsibility for his behavior with his talk about neurological pathways. Really?It may be that you are arguing more because you are slowly coming to terms with the idea that, however charming he may be, this relationship isn’t working for you. Do think about it.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I started therapy almost 9 months ago because I had anxiety problems and knew that I had underlying issues that may be causing it. My anxiety actually got a lot better, however, a few months ago I got extremely depressed, to the point where I very specifically planned out my suicide. Although I feel a lot better now, I still have a fairly low mood, low energy and I gained quite a bit of weight. I wonder if I am ever going to get better, or if this depressive episode has damaged my brain in a way that can’t be repaired. I feel like therapy isn’t helping with this at all – thinking through things can’t really elevate my mood, it actually often makes everything worse.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 There are many possibilities why this may be happening. Talking to your therapist is the best way to start moving through this. You owe it to yourself to explain why you want to leave. If he doesn’t know what you are thinking and feeling, how can he help? Talk to him about what is going on. A phone call termination isn’t your best choice.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I live with my boyfriend we have been together for almost 4 years he have a son who is almost 2 and I am pregnant. My boyfriend is a very paranoid and suspicious person we is very worried that I will cheat on him (even though I never have before he said he is worried because his ex cheated on him and all girls are the same) I’m not allowed to talk to the opposite sex and when I get home from work he will sometimes ask what guys I have talked to at work he gets mad even when I have to talk to a male about work related things. I go out of my way of avoid guys so even if some one asks a simple how are you I won’t have to answer. I have to leave work 5 minutes early and run to my car and speed home so I can get home at the same time every day because if I am not he accuses me of things like staying late to talk to some guy. He always thinks I am lying about everything and there is no way to actually prove if I am lying or not so he just marks it down as “another lie I told” even though I wasn’t lying. I just always feel drained and tired. But I am scared to leave him because I am scared of change and being alone. I am scared that if I leave I will miss him. No mater what I do he will never trust me. What should I do?<|im_end|>

 Thank you for your letter. My experience with men who are chronically jealous, as well as what some of the literature suggests, is that these are traits that tend to be very consistent, and often get worse. That is why I am recommending you have counseling before the baby arrives. His behavior will create more and more resentment with you as time goes on. Ultimately you’ll feel even more unable to “get it right.” For this I highly recommend couples counseling. The find help tab at the top of the page will help you locate someone nearby.You are now in orbit around his jealousy and that orbit will tighten as time goes on. This is something you need to address sooner rather than later. If he won’t go to counseling with you, it would be important to go for yourself.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From Santo Domingo: I’m currently dating a woman that i have known for about 3 years now, 2 from which she was in a relationship with another woman. We dated before she was with her previous partner but at the time it didn’t work out.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Once people are adults, part of dating is learning to accept that most people do have a romantic and sexual past. She has had other partners. You have had more. If she wants to be with you, she needs to find a way to focus on the present and to celebrate that you, after so much experience, choose to be with her. You can’t do that for her. All you can do is repeat that yes, you’ve been with others, but you want to be with her now and give her all the reasons why she is special. Then it is up to her.One other thought: It may be that she worries that you give up on relationships too easily. Ten past relationships at your age is unusual. She may need reassurance that you are willing and able to work on a relationship if things get a little rough between you — not just walk away. I hope that’s the truth. Every relationship goes through some difficult times. If you are committed to this relationship in ways that you were not in prior ones, you need to find a way to tell her so that she can believe.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Recently I just came back home early from a 2 months study  abroad in Europe. I came back to the states earlier because I felt severely depressed being all alone in Europe handling with rents studies food and traveling plans. When I came back home, both my grandparents had passed away. I went to their funerals and wake but I felt grief and sorrow from it. I have many regrets about my lousy decision to study abroad at this time of year. Ever since I got back home, I’m not my usual normal self anymore like how I left the states. I came back a different person. I have the feeling of emptiness and lots of regrets. I was an optimistic, talkative, outgoing and friendly person, now I’m pessimistic, depressed and antisocial. I’m straying away from socializing with my friends, families. I feel fatigue all the time, I just lay in bed all day with loss in appetite and do nothing all day. Everyday is a struggle for me even when I was living alone in Europe. I feel like there’s no point in my life anymore. I’m just not my usual self.  What is going on with me? (age 20, from US)<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Thanks for writing in with your question. I’m sorry for your loss. You’ve been through some major changes in a short amount of time so chances are that they are catching up to you. Grief can mimic clinical depression and cause all the symptoms you mention. The fact that you didn’t adjust well to your travels abroad and felt lonely and isolated may have set the stage for a difficult adjustment coming back home too. Grief is a normal response to loss and change and usually gets better with time, but it is important to allow yourself to feel your feelings, even the sad ones.Even though you don’t “feel like yourself” and don’t have as much interest in the things you normally would, you may benefit from pushing yourself anyway. Get some exercise, go outside when the sun is shining (to increase vitamin D), make plans with friends and family, etc. At first it may just feel like you are faking it and going through the motions, but eventually doing these activities may bring you back around. If not, it would be wise to make an appointment with your doctor for some blood work and to see a counselor. If you don’t want to wait, there is no harm in taking these actions right away. I hope you feel better soon.All the best,<|im_end|>"

From a teen in the Netherlands: I feel so confused.Since I was 10, I have been an anxious person. I was bullied around that time, and I have always been made fun of. I feel like that never really affected me. Then, when I was 12, I remember feeling horrible sensations inside me. I don´t know if those feelings were sadness or anxiety, I just remember being in mere pain. Then, after I turned 13, those feelings were decreasing in intensity. I was definitely still anxious, but I guess I was used to it, so I really cannot remember my emotional experience at that time.<|im_end|>

 Thank you for writing. Although I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of a letter, I can tell you that the feelings you describe are consistent with depression. As you probably know, people with high functioning autism are often anxious. The isolation due to difficulties with social interactions and communication can also trigger feelings of depression.If you are not already in therapy, I hope you will consider seeing someone for an evaluation and recommendations. Look for a therapist who is experienced in working with teens on the autism spectrum. Such a therapist will help you make sense of your feelings and also learn some compensatory behaviors so you can be more comfortable with other people.I also suggest that you read some of Temple Grandin’s books. She is an articulate and helpful member of the community of people on the spectrum. I think you would find her story helpful. There is also an excellent made for TV movie that was filmed in 2010 about her life. Do check out her website as well: http://templegrandin.com/. I think her articles will be very reasssuring.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hello, I have a problem relating to my relationship. About three weeks, my boyfriend and I got into a stupid argument. This argument was based on jealousy, yes, I overreacted and he jumped out of bed and tried to stop me. It was not abusive in any manner, but he thinks that he hurt me. He really didn’t, there were no bruisings and I know it was because I was going to do something much worst. During this time, a lot of traumatic memories have come alive and started to overtake my mind. I overreacted to him talking to a girl about some game. I really didn’t mean to do it but he ended up having his dad book him a flight to Chicago, 1000 miles away. I was scared, he said he loves me and to trust him, that he will be back. He said he wanted to find himself and to just have space to think, that he thought he would become abusive and that he just wanted to think about his actions. I was okay with that, he still talks to me but it is very distant, like not as much texting as we usually do, which is weird to me because we are a close couple.<|im_end|>

  I can appreciate how difficult it is to be apart, and yet both of you need a break to reflect on the relationship, your goals, and what happened. I’d encourage you to give him some space and focus on the things you need to change for yourself in the relationship. This way you can ready if he does come back to have a better relationship — or if he moves on you’ll be in a better place to do the same thing.

From the U.S.: I’m 17 and I’ve been dating my girlfriend for a year now. She is pregnant and is having the baby which I am happy about. Her parents are a little more understanding and supportive while mine on the other hand aren’t taking it so while. Other than trying to help me and be there for me it seems like they are only there to protect themselves by not wanting people to know and making harsh rules. Its always been a constant battle with my parents even before. the baby news. They are a strict traditional family and we live in a society where generations are changing.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It’s difficult for me to help you because the information is incomplete. How are you and your girlfriend going to care for your baby? Are you getting married? Do you have a good job? Are you planning to support the child you helped bring into the world? How are you and your girlfriend going to make sure you both get your high school diplomas? Has either set of parents offered to let the three of you stay with them while you get on your feet? If so, have you had a serious talk about rules and roles? Or are you getting ready to move into a place of your own?The answers to such questions are important. If you are manning-up and doing all you can to be a husband and father, you have the right to demand being treated as an adult. If you are continuing to act like a boy, then your parents are only treating you accordingly.It takes more than making a baby to make you a man — or a father. Rather than continuing to fight about rules with your folks, you and your girlfriend should be focusing on the future you are making for yourselves and your child. Act like a man who is seriously taking on the responsibilities of being a father, and both sets of parents are likely to show you a new respect.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

So before I met my fiancée, she actually dated a famous child actor, whom she had sex with the first time meeting him. But my real problem is she met a singer of a band that she idolizes at a bar one night after his show. They talk and then he follows her to the bathroom and they begin. Now I loved this guy’s music, now it makes me sick to hear it. I saw photos of her just swooning over him. She did whatever he wanted within an hour or so of meeting him, in a bathroom. I can’t stop comparing myself, I hate that she threw herself at him. And I feel I will never be the type of man she truly adores, not a talented and poetic, famous musician. She gladly gave herself to this man with such a short time. Like a groupie and even it being before knowing me it eats me up. Please give me some sort of exercise to cast out the demons I’m putting in my own head. I love her but feel she is settling.<|im_end|>

You don’t say how long it has been since you’ve been going out. If it is a brief time, let’s say a few months, then letting the relationship grow and making sure the two of you belong together is worthwhile.If you’ve been together for a while—perhaps more than a year or so, then you’ll want to acknowledge a few things as you deal with her past. First, is that she has chosen YOU. Child actor, famous musician, whatever—she has chosen to be with you above them. There is a reason for that and that needs to be honored. Your love was more powerful than their fame.Secondly, her past behavior wasn’t something she wanted to continue otherwise she would have. Giving herself sexually so quickly may not have been something she felt okay about afterwards, may have been part of a time in her life when that was exciting for her to do, or may have had unwanted consequences, or fulfilled some desire. Whatever the reasons are she’s moved on and so should you.Believing you aren’t the type of man she truly adores is on your side of the equation. Remembering she has chosen you above everyone to spend her life with is key. When your thoughts go to your unworthiness challenge them with this truth.If you would like some help with this through therapy check on the “find help” link above for someone in your area.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I really struggled in my first year of college, mostly due to life events (first-time academic challenges & inadequate high-school preparation, death of a close relative, illness, abuse, being kicked out of home, losing a lot of friendships, exam anxiety/panic attacks). Anyway, I decided to pull myself together for my second year and did a semester with almost double the normal course-load to get back on track. But I broke down in mid-semester (hadn’t had a day off in 3 months except when I was too sick to study).<|im_end|>

 I don’t think you are any of the bad names you are calling yourself: lazy, weak, stupid, whatever. Your letter shows me that you are insightful and intelligent. You do sound like you may be depressed. You also sound like someone who has things to be depressed about. That list of problems from first year would sink anyone. Your “cure” for first year (taking on a double load during the first semester of second) was guaranteed to make things worse. My goodness! Where was your advisor?!It isn’t fair to yourself to measure yourself as inadequate for not being able to handle college when you haven’t yet had a normal semester with just a normal amount of student stress. My guess is that you haven’t fully recovered from some of the issues from first year. Further, there is no mention in your letter about what you are studying for. If you don’t have a goal that excites you, of course it’s hard to want to do the courses.I’m sorry student counseling wasn’t useful. That’s the first place I usually send someone like you. Most schools do have some kind of mental health services and most are very good. Perhaps you simply didn’t connect well with the person you saw there. I encourage you to try again. School counseling services have lots of experience with problems like yours and are usually helpful. Talk about why you are in college and whether you are ready to take it on. If not, think about doing a gap year program as a way to get some experience and to take time out for self-reflection. You might find this article helpful: “Are You Ready for College? Alternatives for the Unsure.”You are only 18. You have plenty of time to figure out what you want to do and what will help you get there. There is nothing sacred about being in college straight out of high school or of taking some extra time to do it in a way that truly makes a foundation for your future.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 It’s possible that you are not forgetting intentionally. It may be that something is physically wrong. It would be wise to have a medical evaluation to determine what might be wrong. Discuss all of your concerns with the physician and be certain to mention that this problem is increasingly interfering with your life.If medical problems are ruled out, then a psychological origin can be explored. A mental health evaluation will determine what may be wrong. Being evaluated by both medical and mental health professionals can assist you uncovering what may be wrong.Have you recently experienced a life change? Trauma? Are you experiencing a great deal of stress? Recent life changes, trauma or stress might be contributing to the problem. It may also be related to obsessive-compulsive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder.In the meantime, you may want to read about the concept of hyper-intention. The basic premise of hyper-intention is that a person’s fears or problems are made worse by their intense focus on them. Frankl says that the solution to hyper-intention is paradoxical intention. Paradoxical intention means that you do the opposite of what you would normally do in response to something that you fear. You can read more about these concepts in a book called Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl.Medical and mental health evaluations might uncover the source of your problems. Subsequently, consider psychotherapy if it has been indicated. I hope that you are able to find the help that you desire. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I have been with my boyfriend for two and a half years now. During the first 8 months of our relationship we had sex almost everyday, our relationship was amazing. Then in the end of September I found out that he cheated on me, I was devastated so we broke up. Two months later we got back together and I noticed that our sex life fizzled. We still had sex but not nearly as much. While we were broken up he had sexual relations with other girls and I wonder if those other girls made him less sexually attracted to me? Well, zoom past a year later in November in 2010, he broke up with me for reasons that I’m still not sure about, he basically gave me the, “its not you, its me” speech. Towards the end of December, we started back talking and I thought that we were going to get back in a relationship but then he explained to me that he met another girl that he liked and who he thought was more attractive than I am and went on to explain that he didn’t I pretty That crushed my self-esteem because all of that time I thought we had relationship problems because of my actions but never my looks. After that I hated looking at the mirror at myself because I thought/think that I’m ugly and the only time that I did look in the mirror was to scrutinize my flaws and point out exactly what made me not pretty. A month later, my boyfriend came back and said that he made a mistake and that he didn’t think that I was ugly and that he loved me and wanted to be back with me. So, since then we’ve pretty much been in an open relationship, we’ve been back together for about 6 months and they have been amazing but he never ever wants to have sex with me and when we try he isn’t able to reach an erection. He explains that it isn’t because he doesn’t find me sexually attractive and that he doesn’t know what the problem is. Since we are in an open relationship, he isn’t able to have sex with me but he is able to with other girls. I still feel like he doesn’t think that I am pretty or find me sexually attractive but we have got into plenty of arguments where he argues that he thinks that I am. I don’t know what to do because I want our relationship to work but I don’t think that it will be able to if he can’t have sex with me. We’ve only had sex one time since we’ve gotten back together and I don’t want to have sex with other guys. I want a normal relationship. Do you think that the reason he cannot get or keep an erection with me is physical or psychological and what can we do to overcome this barrier? I am in love with him and he is my best friend. I don’t want this to be the cause of the end of our relationship.<|im_end|>

 Thank you for writing to us. The easiest way I can convey what I am about to say is that it is time to move on.Open relationships do not work. It is as simple as that. They have limited value as a transitional stance, but ultimately the very human factors of security, intimacy, and self-esteem eclipse the transitional stance. If they work at all it is because they prevent deeper intimacy, not promote it. For those who want to keep intimacy at bay an open relationship will do the trick.That having been said, your relationship does not sound truly open. You have not mentioned your side of the equation. If he is having sex with other women, are you having sex with other men? If not, why not? If it is because you are hoping to be faithful and that he will eventually curtail his other relationships, history would dictate you are wasting your time.He doesn’t sound like relationship material. If intimacy is what you are looking for, find a person who is willing to be connected to you in a way that mirrors how you are connected to him.

Hi, Here is my issue, I seem to be able to go to work 5 days a week and function (for the most part) fine. However when I get home all I want to do is NOTHING. I have no pleasure in anything at home. Almost every weekend I lay on the couch and say very hurtful things to the people that love me (It’s like I want them to hurt like I hurt)!!! All I want is to be happy and NORMAL, my kids hate me and I don’t blame them. My husband sticks with me and I feel so bad for him because he deserves so much better.I am on wellbutrin at the moment, I have been on so many different drugs and nothing helps.I feel so empty and lost and can’t get motivated for anything. I have let my family down so many times and I just want to be HAPPY can you please help me, there have to be other people out there like me. My Dr. doesn’t know what to do with me, I think he thinks I’m nuts.When I get like this I just want to be alone…PLEASE,PLEASE can you help me so I can help myself?<|im_end|>

 I have helped many people with symptoms exactly like yours. I am not unique in my ability to help people. Somewhere, most likely within 25 miles of where you live now, there is a therapist who can help you. I can answer your questions over the Internet, but I can’t treat you over the Internet.The most important thing for you to remember is that there is a therapist, close to where you are right now, ready and willing to help you. You need to open your phone book, do an Internet search, and begin your inquiries. Ask to speak to the therapist and read to him or her, a list of your symptoms. This should promote a dialogue between the two of you. Thank this person for his or her time and then call the next one on the list. When you have finished with all of your calls, you’ll find that there will be a few therapists that you did not like at all and there may be one or two that you seemed to “click with.” Studies show that it is this latter group of therapists who are the most likely to help you.Carl Jung believed that depression was simply the conscious mind being forced into closer alignment with the unconscious mind, where the roots of consciousness and the beginning of the pathways of consciousness exist. This pathway of growth, he termed individuation. It is similar to Abraham Maslow’s concept of self-actualization. You may be interested in reading more about both topics.You are able to function at work but do not feel emotionally well at home. Your specific circumstances would be highly suggestive to me of the need for talk therapy. Some people take the route of talk therapy others take the route of medication and some do both.I hope you will take my advice and I wish you the best of luck.<|im_end|>"

After looking for work for almost 3 years I am become reluctant to put any more effort into this fruitless action. I feel the same way about pursuing any kind of relationship. I have no goals, dreams, or plans for the future. I’m also tired of hearing ” why don’t you go back to school?” from what ever person i decide to confide in. i cant go back because i cant get any student loans until i pay off the old one. Honestly i just want to walk out of the house with the clothes on my back and embrace the fact that i shouldn’t run away from my fate of dying on the street. I’m not even sure what i should ask.<|im_end|>

 I don’t blame you a bit for feeling discouraged. I don’t blame you a bit for getting depressed. The situation stinks. Your self-esteem has taken a major hit. My guess is that most of the people who counsel you to go back to school just want to have something to say to you. They feel as helpless as you do.Without knowing more about your skill sets, your work history, and what you’ve tried already, I can’t offer you any specific advice. What I can suggest is that you’ve done what you can on your own. You need both practical help and emotional support during this difficult time. Did you know that Cal State at Long Beach has a Women’s Resource Center? The Center has a Career Development Program that might be helpful. If they can’t offer you help themselves, they might know who you could call. For information about the Women & Careers Project, call the Women’s Resource Center (562) 985-8576 or the Career Development Center at (562) 985-4151. Their website says that there is a career workshop in the spring. You might find that useful as well.If you are managing to get by with unemployment benefits and savings, you could also be using this time to maintain and develop skills through volunteering. Yes, I know it’s more gratifying to be paid. But you’ve now got a three-year gap in your resume. Start volunteering so prospective employers will see that you’ve kept up your skills. A volunteer position can also help you with the networking that’s needed these days to find a job.The fact that you bothered to write shows me that you haven’t really given up. I encourage you reach out for some help locally.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Recently I cannot do things I used to do I don’t want to be social with my friends anymore and would rather stay on my own. Along with this, I can no longer have a conversation with my grandparents or dad because of social anxiety even though I could before. When in school now I will feel positive but I know somehow that I’m not and I then will go home afterward and completely change even though I don’t know why I just suddenly end up being really sad. I’ve heard of bi-polar but I don’t know if this is it or if it’s all just social anxiety.<|im_end|>

Even though you said a lot in your letter, you didn’t get to what I think are the most important things. You are lonely in your own house, living in a family where people don’t talk to each other. Your boyfriend’s brother is 11 and lonesome too. He only sees his father every other week so your boyfriend is important to him as a kind of father figure. From the brother’s point of view, you are competition for your boyfriend’s love and attention. He can’t stand it so makes a pest of himself, hoping you’ll go away. His mother may not know how to respond to his loneliness so counts on her older son to do what she thinks she can’t.I think both sets of parents think that what you mean by wanting privacy is that you want to have sex. They aren’t comfortable with that, so they put up obstacles to you and your boyfriend being together. He isn’t allowed at your house. His mother makes having private time in his house impossible. You are experiencing what many young people go through as they explore a serious relationship but with no place of their own.The antidote is more clear communication. Your boyfriend could talk to his mom about how he can’t be a substitute dad for his brother. She needs to give him more of her time, instead of asking your boyfriend to give all of his free time to brotherly love.You could talk to your parents about how to loosen up the rules so that your boyfriend can be there. That probably means talking about boundaries around privacy and sex. And your boyfriend needs to have the same conversation with his mother. If the two of you are mature enough and sure enough of your relationship to want to be sexually active, you are mature enough to have difficult conversations.I have a guess that both sets of parents are concerned that you two are too exclusive. If you don’t have other friends as well, they are right to be concerned. Instead of limiting the relationship you do have, it would be more helpful if they would encourage you to enrich your friendships and to bring other people home to meet them and enjoy their company.At 18, you are both close to a time when you will be able to get out on your own. Being clear now with each other about your expectations and limitations regarding closeness and sex will help you manage your situation for the next year. I hope you are both doing well in school and making plans for the future — be it more schooling, training in a tech job, or full time work. Supporting each other in future planning will also help strengthen your relationship in the present.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of a letter, of course. However, from what you wrote, my first guess would be that your doctors are correct. The behaviors you are reporting are typical of social anxiety.I’m more interested in supporting you in getting real treatment than in confirming a diagnosis. Cognitive-behavior therapy has been found to be very useful for managing social anxiety. There are also medications that can help you feel a little better so that you can make good use of the talk therapy.My suggestion to you is that you stop looking at sites about mental illness and start going to a mental health counselor who can both answer your questions and can get your started on treatment to manage your distress.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From a teen in Singapore: Since I was 5, I have the thought that being the oldest sibling at home I need to put on a strong front in order for my mum to not worry about me or just people finding me weak. I don’t know if it’s because of my Father going to jail since I was young that caused it, but i always feel ashamed after crying in front on anyone and I hide all of my emotions except those positive ones.<|im_end|>

I’m so glad you reached out to us. Yes, it may be that you learned at a young age not to make things “worse” for your mother by keeping your feelings to yourself. But that was a conclusion that was reached by a very little person. Little kids often don’t make wise decisions. You’ve now been living this way so long that it’s become a bad habit that is cutting you off from others and making you miserable.I hope you can find a counselor to talk to who can help you reevaluate the decision you made when you were so young. You can learn more appropriate ways to handle your feelings. You can learn ways to interact with others that allows them to see all of you, not just the side of you that is happy.If you can’t find a counselor, do consider joining a forum here at PsychCentral. People from all over the world give others support and advice.Do follow up. Your relationships with others won’t be healthy and happy until you do. You deserve to be able to experience and express all of your feelings.I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

I think I have the symptoms. I went my whole life knowing I’m an empath and I still kinda believe it but what I’ve discovered is that I can’t form emotional bonds with people. I can’t feel other people’s emotions, and I don’t have remorse for anything. Why though? Is it because I get PTSD over the littlest of things? I didn’t have trauma in my childhood and nor did I have it at all. I know that I get angry a lot, but the rest of my emotions are “shallow”; for lack of better words. Is it because I’m detached? I have these erotic fantasies too that I’ve had for my whole life. To me they aren’t disturbing though. I thoroughly enjoy them but I don’t want to go to jail. This part could be PTSD related too but idk. I don’t hear voices either. So do you think it’s at all possible I have PTSD?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s start with a few definitions to make sure we are on the same page. You say you know you are an empath, but an empath, at least the standard definition of it, doesn’t sound at all like what you are experiencing.Typically, empaths are thought of as super sensitive to other’s emotions, positive and negative, and function like highly attuned vibrational instruments. Empaths feel everything, perhaps to a fault, and do not intellectualize their experiences. They operate using their intuition and emotional acuity. They are classically very giving, nurturing souls with exceptional listening skills and high-level spirituality. For more information, you may want to read more about empath’s by the doctor who wrote the book on them, and to take Dr. Judith Orloff’s quiz to determine if, indeed, you are one. But from what you’ve stated here it doesn’t seem you are. You can access her work here.The reason I think we have to start with your declaring yourself as an empath is that your descriptions sound like it is exactly the opposite of the above definition: I’m an empath and I still kind of believe it, but what I’ve discovered is that I can’t form emotional bonds with people. I can’t feel other people’s emotions and I don’t have remorse for anything. Not being able to form bonds with others, not feeling their emotions, and not feeling remorse, quite honestly, sound like the exact opposite of what you’d expect from an empath.The second thing you also write that you are angry, shallow, and wonder if it is because you are “detached.” Anger is defined by Merriam-Webster as “a strong feeling of displeasure and usually of antagonism.” This emotion is, by definition, strong, and detached classically refers to an inability to connect with others emotionally. Again, not at all how an empath is typically identified, and not the usual way anger, shallow, and detached would be connected to each other.You then link erotic fantasies (sexual arousal from imagery) that you enjoy and are not disturbing and wonder if these might be a cause for a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Without any other information, this doesn’t go together either.PTSD comes from a chronic mental and emotional stress that happens as a result of a deep psychological shock that most often disturbs sleep, with a constant recollection, usually with vivid detail of the shock or injury that’s taken place. (To learn more about PTSD, please read here. ) None of this seems to have been going on or is described in your email.Yet it is clear that something is bothering you. I think that is important to focus on, but I don’t think the current definitions and connections accurately describe what is happening. Since you list yourself as a freshman in college, I would take the opportunity to talk to one of the therapists at the college counseling center. They are trained in asking the right questions to reach an understanding of what’s going on — and what can be done to help.<|im_end|>"

I have a master’s degree in education and I make a decent earning as a teacher. I met my husband 9 years ago- married 4 yrs ago. He is 17 years older than me and he didn’t even finished high school. He is just a hard working man, who has a general labor job. He is a great, decent man. He treats me with love and respect; and we get along really well. Honestly we have an excellent marriage and “education or money” has never been an issue between us. The HUGE problem is with my parents, who practically hate him. Although my parents “pretend” in front of him (I mean, they have been nice to him) only I know how much resentment they have towards my husband. My parents have made it very clear to me that they don’t like him at all. Lately my mother is driving me crazy telling me how stupid I am, that I should get a divorce, that he is “enjoying me”, that the man of the house should be the provider- not me; etc. It hurts me so bad. I have never replied anything to my mother. But since my mom’s comments have been so frequent lately this is killing me. To make it worse my husband thinks my parents like him. Please help me, I don’t know what to do; I feel so sad right now.<|im_end|>

 Let me see if I understand this: You are married to a man who works hard. He adores and respects you. You get along fine. It is neither to your credit or to his blame that we live in a culture that often doesn’t respect people who work with their hands as much as those who work with their head. Right? So, at 31 years old, why are you so reactive to your parents’ opinion? Yes, it’s a shame that they are so shallow. I agree. But there is really no point in trying to reason with people who are unreasonable.I’m concerned that in your efforts to make peace or by your silence, you have inadvertently given your parents the idea that there is something to argue about. There isn’t. Stand by your man. He – and your marriage – are worth it. Tell your parents in no uncertain terms to get over it. You love him. He loves you. It’s too bad they can’t be happy for you but oh well.Then stay out of debates, discussions, and arguments. If they bring it up again, just remind them that it’s their issue, not yours, and change the subject.Then enjoy having a marriage that so many people in the world wish they could find.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

You already know what to do, you just have to do it. If he is unwilling to get help that shouldn’t stop you from getting it. Sometimes marriages can really be helped by just one person going and by them changing their behavior. You are also then role modeling positive behaviors for both him and your kids.I would just find a therapist you can relate to and keep encouraging him to go too. In the end, if things don’t get better you can at least say you tried everything you could. It may be that you can learn some different coping skills that will allow you to deal with him in a way that doesn’t bring you down.It also may be the case that you come to realize that if he isn’t willing to change and try to improve himself, you will be better off without him. I’m certainly not pro-divorce, but I don’t believe we should go down with a sinking ship if we can save ourselves. You have a responsibility to yourself and your kids, not just the marriage. I wish you good luck and hope things get better.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I’ve recently been cut off from a couple of friends who I have romantic feelings for. I can’t shut off my feelings for them and I was having regular panic attacks about it, so they no longer talk to me. We had been living together and they asked me to leave. It’s been three months and I can’t stop thinking about them.<|im_end|>

  I am very sorry you are suffering so. But you already know that the intensity of your reaction to rejection is way too much — and has gone on much too long. Since this has gone on since childhood, it suggests to me that there was a traumatic experience in your childhood from which you have never recovered. I’m guessing that maybe there is something about the way you are in relationships that contributes to people leaving you.You already know that trying to get back with the people who asked you to leave is not a realistic option. You do need therapy for this.It’s hard for me to believe that there are no therapists in your area who keep late afternoon, evening and Saturday hours. Most therapists in private practice do. And many offer a sliding fee scale to make it affordable.I suggest that you talk to your primary care doctor about getting a list of names of therapists or clinics in the area who can help you. If you have a faith, you might also look into whether the clergy are available for free counseling.Rejection is an inevitable part of life. Not everyone “clicks” in the same way. Not everyone we admire or want to befriend, returns the feelings. It is unrealistic to think you will never experience it again. What you can change is your response to it.You have suffered with this problem for far too long. I really hope you will make a concerted effort to find the help you need. Therapy will help you gain insight into what perhaps you can change so you are less likely to be rejected as well as how to manage it when it ihappens.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I’m not in a constant state of sadness, but I have moments where I feel very sad, sometimes even suicidal. I recently asked my parents if I could get a therapist, but I only mentioned stress because I thought they would be too worried if I mentioned depression, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts. However, I did end up telling my principal two days ago that I think about harming myself about once a week, which means she told my dad that I do. He’s in another country, so he’s not addressing it directly; he has just been writing more emails to me. I broke up with my boyfriend about 3 months ago (about a month after school started), and ever since then, I feel very awkward when talking to anyone besides the people I have known for two years. I’m always unconsciously thinking about what to say next. I know I have a lot of friends at school, but it just does not feel comfortable talking to any of them (this is my first year going to this school). Before I broke up with my boyfriend, I was just shy in talking to some people, not awkward. I am theorizing that breaking up with him has done something to my conscience, but I’m not entirely sure why.<|im_end|>

I can hear your persistence and bravery and trying to address these uncomfortable feelings in your life. I think you’ve done all the right things. Letting your principal know is a good thing and, even though your dad is away and hasn’t been able to help very much, the important thing is that you’re talking to somebody about your thoughts and feelings.The kind of things you are talking about are symptoms that professional people have learned a great deal about. If your parents will not let you see a therapist, or are slow to make those arrangements, ask to see your general physician or pediatrician. When you talk to him or her explain these thoughts and he or she will be able to get you the help you need. The important thing is that you keep reaching out and letting people know what’s going on.You may also want to use our online forums to make a connection with others dealing with similar issues.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I’ve had social anxiety disorder most of my life and have coped with it well until it seems recently. Lately, I’m sad and upset all the time, I cry often over nothing more than my thoughts, I don’t get out of bed, and I’ve called out/left work early just to be alone. I feel numb or sad, and I also feel really worried that my boyfriend doesn’t like me anymore or is cheating (though he has given no reason for me to feel this way). I thought it was just anxiety at first, but this isn’t a panicky feeling, this is just utter despair. This is not the first time I’ve experienced this, but the last few times I thought it was circumstantial. Usually this lasts about a month or two before I go back to normal. However, last summer I experienced what may have been hypomania for a month and a half — I had sexual relations with multiple people in a short time, drank heavily every night, and didn’t sleep for a week and felt great. I thought I was on top of the world, that everyone loved me, and I could do anything I wanted. Now I feel utterly worthless, unwanted, unloved, and alone. At this particular moment in time, I feel awful about myself and my life, but I can’t sleep and I feel more awake than I’ve felt in weeks. I’ve been considering seeing a psychiatrist for social anxiety again for a while, but should I consider addressing this issue, or am I worried about nothing?<|im_end|>

 I don’t think you are “worried about nothing.” Your symptoms are unusual. They are outside the norm. People don’t normally have extreme changes in their mood. Emotions should be under control and balanced. Your symptoms might be indicative of depression or bipolar disorder. The best way to determine a diagnosis is to consult a mental health professional for an evaluation.After the evaluation, treatment will be suggested. A combination of medication and talk therapy often proves most beneficial. Medication can stabilize your mood. Therapy provides a supportive environment where you can talk to someone who is objective and neutral. You and your therapist can work together to identify the problems that are interfering with your life. Therapy can teach you new skills about how to manage your mood and the everyday challenges that inevitably arise in life.You can either return to your previous psychiatrist or ask your primary care doctor for a referral. Friends and family might also be good referral sources. You might want to try reading reviews about different therapists in the Psychology Today database. Psych Central also has a searchable therapist directory. I wish you well. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I have no ability to maintain self control over anything I do. Thankfully I do not enjoy acts such as smoking, or drinking. Yet, the level to which I can’t maintain self control over the things I do enjoy is debilitating, and frustrating. I am constantly on electronics, not socially though (E.g. Talking to people). I can’t seem to stop myself from playing video games, surfing the internet, etc. This is not regular either, I’m a student and I would say almost every minute I’m not eating, or attending class, I’m on my computer, or phone. This can go until 8:00AM the next day, or I’ll even just pull an all-nighter to continue doing what I’m doing on my devices.<|im_end|>

 The inability to stop using technology is a common problem. If you Google “can’t stop using phone” or related keywords you will find many articles about the subject. Researchers are trying to determine why people can’t seem to put down their phones.Modern technology is also causing problems on the roadways. Texting while driving is a serious health hazard, yet many people continue to do it. Researchers say it’s mainly because texting while driving is not yet considered socially unacceptable, as is the combination of drinking while driving. Until people see it as shameful it seems that they will continue to do it.Part of the problem is that technology is universally accessible. The majority of individuals have smart phones. Pews Research Center indicates that 77% of Americans own smart phones. Many people who have them are struggling with the same types of issues you have described.Some researchers consider the inability to stop using technology to be an addiction. It provides quick feedback and instant gratification. If so, it is not necessarily a matter of “self-control” for which you need to be “punished.” They say that it provides a high similar to illicit drugs or gambling. It seems to be a habit that for some is difficult to break.You might try researching how to stop using technology but the best and most efficient solution is to consult a knowledgeable local therapist. This is especially important because of your possible depression and attention deficit disorder. These may be worsening the problem and in fact may be its main contributors. A good therapist will examine the problem and design an effective solution. Ask your primary care physician for a referral or consult the university counseling center. They will help you to find the appropriate counseling services. Good luck and please take care.<|im_end|>"

I am wondering (& def believe) stepdaughter lengthy ongoing issues stems from psych problem but no diagnosis yet. We are desperate for help since this has been going on for over 15 years. My 31 year old stepdaughter has had drug problems for 15 years &  just up & left yet another rehab while on Vivitrol. She goes into detox hospitals and then gets transferred to residential recovery houses, which she stays at for a couple weeks then up and leaves and then loops through this process again and again. I know she has said she is empty inside and has talked abt hurting herself, but it’s hard to tell if she actually is being honest about that or is using that to get back in rehab places after she has left. She doesn’t seem to have reasons for leaving any of these places. Though, she acts very immature and does seem to struggle with authority and taking responsibility for anything. She has been in trouble with law, and while once she cared very much for her looks, she now has covered her body in tattoos. She has a young daughter, who she OD’ed in front of (she no longer has custody) & parents who are desperate to get her help and finally get her on the right path. But she seems to easily disconnect from what she’s done and does &  doesn’t seems to care how much she is hurting and worrying everyone. . With all these hospitals and rehabs she has been in, she has gotten some counseling, but i very much believe she has an underlying mental health prob that has not been diagnosed that could be at the root of this. I am hoping you could advise on anything you might think it could be. Thank you so much!!! (From the USA)<|im_end|>

 Unfortunately the description you have offered is all too common. It is typical for the number of residential rehabilitations to be several in number (some sources pointing to more than a half dozen) before a successful take happens. Typically, mental health issues are concomitant concerns and evaluated for as part of the process.I wish there was an easy answer, but the brief stays combined with withdrawal issues and the new living situation often doesn’t allow for an accurate assessment. Sometimes the legal complications can actually help — if the rehabilitation is mandatory. This allows for a longer stay and for support services to be coordinated once the individual is released.I would highly recommend Nar-Anon or Al-Anon for you and your family in coping with this ongoing problem. They have support and decades of wisdom to offer as you cope with your stepdaughter’s behavior.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

 I worry that you are putting too much pressure on yourself. I know. I know. The media and the general culture all suggest that if you haven’t found true love by the time you are out of your teens, there is something wrong with you. But you know what? Lots of people don’t find the right person to love until well into their twenties; sometimes later.It just may be that the reason you don’t go further sexually is that in your heart you know the guy isn’t the right one. Maybe you are a woman who only wants to be that intimate with someone who loves her and cherishes her and wants to be with only her. It’s at least a possibility. And it’s nothing to be ashamed of.If you’ve been over the moon in love with someone and still couldn’t be intimate, it’s another matter. In that case, it might be helpful to talk to a therapist who can get your whole story. I’ve only got a short letter to go on. A few sessions with a therapist could help you figure out if there is a deeper issue. If so, the two of you could then talk about how you could make some changes.Please remember that you are only 22. You have plenty of time to find the right partner.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 Confrontation involves a hostile interaction between two opposing parties. Confrontation, in this situation, would not be a good idea. I don’t think you meant it in that way.Perhaps what you are asking is whether or not you should approach her about your concerns. That might not be a good idea either because you and she are no longer friends. She may not welcome unsolicited advice about something so personal.It might be a better idea to discuss your concerns with a school staff member or another trusted adult. This could be the guidance counselor, a teacher or the principal. If you choose not to, then your parents might be able to help.It is good that you care about her well-being.

From Barbados: when i was eleven yrs old I was encouraged by my older cousin (let’s call her Jyl) to have s** with her brother (who is also my cousin) at first i objected, but she continued to pressure me so I did as she said. Eventually Jyl spoke out about the matter but never speak out about the role she played in the situation. I didn t even defend myself when she (Jyl) confessed it all, I just put on a strong face, but I was crying on the inside. Eventually everyone found out about it, as you know words spread like bush fire. In high school I was bullied for it and other rumors that Jyl and my so call friends created about me.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Your past did not ruin your life! You were only 11! You were a victim of child abuse, not a willing or knowledgeable participant in sex. In the U.S., 11 is well below the age of legal consent. (I don’t know the law in Barbados but age 11 is a child as far as I’m concerned, regardless of legalities.) You deserve compassion and support, not bullying.Your parents could confirm whether the principal really did put something in your record. I hope that is another nasty rumor, not fact. I’m not a lawyer so I can’t give you legal advice but if there is something in your record I do think your parents might want to consult a lawyer about your rights to privacy about something that happened to you as a child. If the lecturers are participating in the bullying, I hope your parents will insist that it stop.As for your cousin and so-called friends: You need a better class of friends. I suspect “Jyl” keeps bringing it up as if she had no part in it because she knows that she and her brother are guilty of doing something terrible to you. She rationalizes it by shifting the responsibility for it on to you. By doing that, she doesn’t have to face her own guilt — and she is continuing to abuse you.It’s asking a lot of you, but I hope you can find the strength to stand up for yourself. If someone bullies you about early sex, you might say something like, “I was only 11 and was taken advantage of by people who were old enough to know better. I trusted them and they abused me. That’s not something to bully me about.” If they don’t quit, avoid them if you can. Get adults to help you. Do consider going to another school and making a fresh start if you think that is the only way to get away from the bullies. Taking care of your emotional well-being is more important than trying to change them.You are no different from the many, many other people who have been victimized as children. People do recover from abuse and do create good lives for themselves. You absolutely have a future — as long as you refuse to accept the opinions of toxic people. You will get a job based on your education and your skills, not on rumors about something that happened to you when you were a kid.Being bullied is very, very difficult. You might appreciate having a therapist to talk to about how to handle “Jyl” and the bullies and how to hold onto your self-esteem in spite of their horrible behavior.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From Canada: I’m in treatment for bulimia and alcoholism and I’ve been consumed by thoughts of past events. When I was 12, a stranger touched my breast outside my shirt, and said very vulgar things to me. That isn’t sexual abuse, is it? That’s all he did. I just can’t stop thinking about it. Then, as a young adult, I had three encounters that I don’t really understand: 1. A stranger in college fondled me while I was sleeping on a couch at school. I woke to him touching me, BUT I always assumed it my fault because I think I felt the touch/responded before waking. 2. I got very drunk at a club one night and brought a stranger back to the hotel room my friend and I were sharing. I was in a blackout, this I know. But the next day, my friend told me I ended up passing out and the man had sex with me while I was passed out. 3. A female friend of mine invited me over. I knew she was gay, had no idea she liked me. I was (obviously) in active addiction and drinking, and she was very encouraging of my drinking. she asked if she could braid my hair, I said yes, and she started touching me after playing with my hair for a minute. We had sex. I didn’t say no. I think I even said yes. When I woke up and realized, I was distraught. But is this just because I regret having had sex, or was something wrong?<|im_end|>

 Please do talk to your team. They are healers, not judges. They are there to help you deal with your feelings and learn from your experiences.Clearly, it was in no way your fault that a man touched you inappropriately and said terrible things to you when you were so young. It’s very fortunate that it stopped with words and some touching. The fact you can’t stop thinking about it now tells me that you were profoundly affected by it and that you need some help processing it.My guess is that the incident at school felt like a repeat of what happened when you were 12. You were frozen in fear and didn’t know what to do in both situations Your therapy should help you forgive yourself for being scared and should focus on developing skills so it doesn’t happen again.As for the other two events: Part of your therapeutic work is figuring out why you let yourself get into dangerous or inappropriate situations and learning how to love and take care of yourself. Your team can’t help you do those things unless you find the courage to be honest with them and fully engage in treatment. I hope you will. You’ve begun the important work of treatment.

From a teen in the U.S.: I will try my best to get all of this stuff out in a condensed manner. Contextually, I may have been traumatized during my 3rd grade school year. I remember the incident unusually well, and can recall definite features 8 years after the fact. I had gotten into an argument with this one kid.

According to the DSM5, the first criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD is that “The person was exposed to: death, threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence”. It’s a stretch to consider a threat to be sent to the principal as meeting that criteria. That being said, some kids are so sensitive and/or anxious, that their reactions to stressful situations are unusually extreme. It seems that you are by temperament an anxious person. For that reason, it’s possible that the teacher’s behavior was traumatizing to you.It sounds to me that you continue to be anxious. It could be that you latched onto the incident from so many years ago as a way to make sense of your anxiety. It could also be that you haven’t yet figured out a way to navigate conflict with women and that triggers memories from then.In my opinion, you’ve suffered with anxiety and the fallout from that incident much too long. You are understandably sick of it. You said that you are often in despair. Regardless of whether an assessment would determine an official diagnosis of PTSD, you are in emotional pain. That is reason enough to get some help.A mental health professional will be able to determine a diagnosis, of course. But far more important than a label is that counseling will help you learn new skills for managing your emotions and for dealing with stressful interactions with people. You are in your teens. Working these issues through now will help you now and in the future. You deserve to have a life without despair.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 Let’s see if we can approach this by making a comprehensive list of not only where you need help, but also by you taking the character strength survey located here. The survey will help you identify what your strengths are (for free) so that you can see a more balanced view of yourself. In this way the issues you will be looking to improve on are seen along with your strengths.Second, I would recommend you contact a therapist familiar with cognitive behavior therapy (see the find help tab at the top).

 Animal hoarding is not a well understood phenomenon. Generally, an animal hoarder is an individual who, like your friend, begins adopting many pets. They soon can no longer say no. They are often motivated by their love of animals. They don’t want to see them suffer but before they realize it, they have adopted too many pets and are overwhelmed.Others are motivated by loneliness. It may be that some people have difficulty connecting with others but find it easy to bond with animals. The reasons behind animal hoarding can vary greatly.The main problem with animal hoarding is that it can and often does inadvertently lead to the suffering of animals. The Humane Society of the United States considers animal hoarding to be inhumane and cruel.Your friend can no longer properly care for the cats. As you mentioned, you re-adopted your cat to end his or her suffering. If your cat was suffering, then in all likelihood so were the others.In addition to the animals suffering, your friend’s health is likely being compromised. If the ammonia smell is causing respiratory problems in the cats, then in all likelihood it is harming her as well. It is a dangerous health hazard for all occupants of the home.You wish to personally intervene in this situation but that may be difficult. There are several strategies that you could try but denial may be your biggest obstacle. Denial is a common reaction among individuals in these situations. It is important to keep that in mind.You could start by being honest with her about why you took your cat out of her home. She may be shocked to hear the truth.Another approach is to discuss your concerns with her friends or family. They probably are concerned as well. Having others supporting your point of view will strengthen your argument.You can also suggest that she call the local animal shelter. She can ask for their advice about how to handle the situation. I understand her reluctance to call the animal shelter but it may be her only option at this time. It would be the most humane option.If she refuses to call the animal shelter, then you can call. They may have suggestions for how you can effectively intervene. You can also call the local police department. Many police departments are familiar with the public health hazards associated with animal hoarding.Finally, you can read more about animal boarding on the Animal Planet website. Animal Planet produces a show called Confessions: Animal Hoarding. Their website provides information about animal hoarding. The website also allows concerned individuals to submit a story about someone they believe is in immediate need of help. In addition, the find help tab at the top of this page can help you find a mental health specialist in hoarding.There is no easy way to handle this situation. It is a sad state of affairs for both your friend and the suffering animals. I hope something can be done. I wish you and your friend the best of luck.<|im_end|>"

My 18-year marriage ended nearly five years ago. With counseling, I learned that my ex likely has some level of NPD. It is important to me to not repeat this situation, so I evaluate new relationships carefully and proceed slowly.<|im_end|>

  I admire the cautious approach and the fact that you don’t want to end up with another man with narcissistic traits. However, the anger, jealousy, and verbal abuse create a similar dynamic for you. Your emotional well-being is in orbit around him. Rather than see these problems coming his own insecurities and inability to self-regulate his emotions, he is pointing at your actions as a cause.The fact that these conflicts are emerging regularly with others is important. It sounds more like a characterlogical issue with him than something you keep doing wrong. Also- the blackouts from his anger would suggest he gets overwhelmed by his emotions. When you put these issues together it sounds clear that he has an anger management issue.Typically, this isn’t something you’ll want to treat in couple therapy. This is an issue he will have to deal with on his own. I’d recommend a support group for you (there are many in your area) to help you set limits with him. There are a number of anger management groups as well as individuals in your area who specialize in helping men control their abuse.I’d look for a support group for yourself first — most likely through a woman’s center. Then I would use that support to help you explain to him that his behavior has become unacceptable and that he needs to work on it in therapy if the relationship is going to continue. My concern is that these issues are not likely to get better on their own — and over time may continue to get worse.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I’m extremely attracted to death. I just spent over 4 hours researching about Sid Vicious and the murder of his former girlfriend. I get that it’s a popular rock myth, but I spent even more time looking up information about the Columbine High School shooting as well. I was up until 3am reading Eric Harris’ journals and it’s all so intriguing to me, and I don’t feel disgusted at all about what they’ve done, like, I don’t despise the shooting but am sad for the victims. The reason I’m asking about this is because I’m often in a violent mood. When my depression was bad, I nearly broke the whole house. I’ve hit my parents and worse even. I haven’t done any of these things in almost a year, but at times I still catch myself thinking about such awful things. I don’t believe I’d act on any of them, but it still scares me. I like it and hate it at the same time. It’s a dark kind of pleasure that distracts me from the kind person I really am. I know I am, but something inside me feels so contradicting to it. I currently am in therapy and have been for a few months now with the same therapist and have been improving, but it still worries me, and it’s dreadful to even consider talking about it with her.<|im_end|>

 Many people are interested in understanding why people kill. They want to know what compels some people to commit these horrible acts of violence. That’s probably why these types of television shows are so popular.However, in the context of your history of aggression toward your parents, you should avoid indulging in this “dark pleasure.” By your own admission, this subject matter “distracts [you] from being the kind of person” you know you are. It also “scares” you. It seems to be doing more harm than good.It’s a mistake to withhold this information from your therapist. It’s obviously something that bothers you and that you wonder about. Therapy is a safe place to discuss your feelings about this matter. Lack of self-disclosure can significantly inhibit your therapist’s ability to help you. You’re holding back information that your therapist needs to know. Continuing to do so can hinder your progress in therapy.It’s important that you explore your “attraction to death” in more depth. I would recommend discussing this matter with your therapist and being honest about your feelings. Therapy is the ideal place to do this. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My husband works a lot which really helps our family. The problem is he never wants to go anywhere with my children and me. When he gets home from work, he’s highly irritable and often goes around the house criticizing me for practically everything. Cleaning, watching the kids, what I did or didn’t do during the day, Ext. Most every time I talk with him, he has something negative to say about me. Something I didn’t do right. This is really starting to wear on me. My Self Esteem is pretty bad and this makes it worse. I also get very anxious when I know he’s coming home soon, because I know it is going to be constant critiques. Also, when I ask him if he wants to go someplace with me and the kids, he never wants to and gets upset about it. I get in a bad mood too and he ends up leaving. In which doesn’t make any sense because he said he didn’t want to go anywhere. I have told him how much these things bother me. Every time, he turns around and says what bother him. Nothing gets resolved. I work from home and it’s difficult because I am also watching the kids. He doesn’t like anyone else watching the kids so I try to the majority of the time, unless I have somewhere important to go to. We used to be a lot different. We would go out to dinner, shopping, ext. We would watch TV together and he really didn’t critique me all too much. He used to say good things about me in which he doesn’t say anymore. For example, he used to call me “pretty girl”. He has not said that for awhile now. We have also went through some crap that hurt our relationship. I wasn’t very mature when we started dating so I made some poor decisions that I would never do presently. I’d love to know what changed our relationship so much? Is he acting like this for revenge or because he’s not happy? I can honestly say I’m miserable when I’m around him. I cannot say I’m overall miserable because I do enjoy spending time with my children. My underneath layer is hurt, badly. I feel like my feelings don’t matter. I don’t know when and if to call it quits. We have been married for 6 years and I don’t give up easily. I do love him but I wish he was how he was when we got married. He actually cared and SHOWED me how much he loved me.<|im_end|>

 Thank you for your heartfelt letter. It sounds like the marriage has been on a slide for quite a while. When this is the case you’ll want to use a therapist who specialized in couple work. This is important because you need someone to mediate what is happening. You can use the Find Help tab at the top of the page for people from this organization. They can provide you with guidelines to help the two of you move forward. If your husband is unwilling to go, you could go for individual therapy. This will provide you with support as you learn strategies to deal with the relationship.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: My parents and I have always not seen eye to eye, ever since I could walk there has always been physical and emotional abuse. My dad would get drunk and throw plates at my mother and on bad nights my dad would come into our room and break our toys. Both my parents grew up in terrible environments so my understanding was that being mean was all they knew. The last straw for me was my sophomore year in high school when my father was supposed to pick me up, my phone died and I was late getting to his car, he screamed at me and told me to walk home, 4 miles in the dark without a phone.<|im_end|>

 You and your boyfriend deserve to feel enormous pride for what you’ve been able to accomplish in spite of tragedy and hardship. Don’t let anyone, ever, take that away from you.The power of addiction is enormous. Although it feels to you like you were unwanted and unloved by your dad, I doubt that was the case. It felt that way because the addiction was even bigger than the love. Imagine how big, then, the addiction was – and perhaps is. It dominated your dad’s life. If that were not bad enough, neither parent had grown up learning the skills needed to cope with life, stay sober and raise kids. My guess is that you are doing so well because you learned from their bad example. You know what not to do.Your father may have turned his life around in terms of stopping drinking. But he still has a lot to learn about taking responsibility for his life. He is still acting like an addict — shifting blame rather than owning up to his own past. There is no way you could “make” your mother turn against him. You simply don’t have that power. Having meaningful conversations with her where you both acknowledge the family history and figure out how to do better is important to healing the family.Although it’s commendable that you want to include your parents in your life in spite of how they have treated you, it will continue to be challenging. Your father, especially, may not be ready to do it. Fortunately, you don’t have to figure this out on your own. If you haven’t already, I suggest you find out if there is a local chapter of Al-Anon in your community. Al-Anon helps family members of recovering alcoholics learn how to maintain the difficult balance of relating to a person in recovery but not letting it overwhelm them. The organization will also coach you in how to effectively interact with your brother. For information, go to their website at www.al-anon.org.

From the Netherlands: I am 27 and I feel very inappropriate about what happened between me and my brother when we were kids (I was about 13/14 years old and my brother 11/12). Basically he tricked me into ‘teaching’ him how to handle things with a girl, like kissing and touching. He told me as an older sister I should safe him from disasters with girls by letting him touch and kiss me so he wouldn’t look like a fool when he tried it.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Clearly, it was not insignificant. These events are still having a negative impact on your life. You don’t trust men and aren’t open to a loving relationship. You deserve better.Let’s take a look at what happened: Initially you and your brother were just kids. Adults often look back on things they did when they were young and wonder what on earth they were thinking! It does make sense that you enjoyed the sexual exploration at first. The body responds even when the mind is immature. But very quickly you realized you had crossed a line so you told your brother it couldn’t happen again. This is not at all an unusual story.What is unusual is that your brother kept it up and even took advantage of you while you were asleep. As I read your story, I had to ask myself what was going on that made it difficult for you to tell him to stop and mean it. Apparently, all you felt you could do was try your best to avoid the vulnerability of sleeping in the same room. I don’t have enough information to help you understand that. A therapist who can hear your whole story would be able to help you figure it out and forgive yourself for that.Sadly, your early experience with sexuality paired enjoying being stimulated with shame. At 27, these feelings are still with you. I doubt that you can move on without some help. I strongly urge you to seek out a counselor to help you come to terms with your feelings and to help you break the silence with your brother. It would be terrible if you were to go through life deprived of the pleasures of a trusting relationship and intimacy with a loving partner because of something that happened when you were a teen.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

And I told him that I would never ever in a million years do something to ruin this relationship.<|im_end|>

 What you should do is ditch this guy immediately. You may love him but his idea of “love” is all about control and manipulation.

I’m acquainted with somebody and not sure what I’m dealing with. He never seems to express anger even when anger is appropriate, and he makes gender-oriented comments towards women that are superficially conversational but otherwise quite demeaning. For example, he’ll bring up a teacher he had in high school (17 yrs ago) and describe her as a “feminazi” because of a comment she made about a gym bag being brought to class being a “guy thing”. This isn’t the only time I’ve heard him use the term, either.<|im_end|>

 There was once a mental health disorder called passive aggressive personality disorder contained in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). Individuals who had been diagnosed with this disorder complied with the desires of others but internally felt resentful. In the process of seeming compliant, they could covertly express their hostility or anger. It’s possible that he may be demonstrating some of those traits.To be able to offer an opinion about what might be wrong with him, I would need more information about his personality and his behavior towards others. You have provided some examples, but it’s not enough for me to provide you with an informed opinion. What we do know about him is that he seems rude, insensitive, opinionated and, perhaps, chauvinistic and narcissistic.You believe that he is an emotional abuser and you do not seem to like being around him. In that case, it may be best to keep your distance. Establish very clear boundaries and do not spend much time in his presence, if you can help it. It’s important to keep yourself and those around you safe.If you like to write back and provide more details about this individual, I may be able to provide a more informed opinion on this matter.

Recently, I’ve been feeling sad, although I’m not sure that’s enough to see somebody. I’ve never had very high self esteem, and during high school I think I went through periods of depression. I even self-harmed during those times. The only person I’ve ever opened up to and relied on was my boyfriend, but he recently broke up with me before he went off to University. That has been getting to me because sometimes I feel like I’m mourning even though obviously he’s still alive. Currently, I’m stuck at home going to community college because I didn’t have good enough grades in high school, and I only have two close friends that I talk to daily (but not about this kind of stuff). I’ve been feeling lonely lately but I don’t know if it’s something to be worried about or not.<|im_end|>

 It is more than enough — and it is a sign of great courage to acknowledge how you feel and ask for help with that feeling.Breaking up with your boyfriend would cause feelings of mourning and talking to the counselor at school is exactly the right thing to do. The way through this now is for you to focus on self care. Taking really good care of your mental, physical, and intellectual well being should be a priority. I think individual therapy with the counselor is a great starts, and if they have a group they can offer to you as well I would join. Learning how to manage your feelings in the presence of others can be very helpful as well.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I am happily married, working in a job I enjoy, and by all standards live a regular life. But every year, around the same time (the end of January) I become severely depressed. I don’t want to see anyone, I’m not myself at work, I cry all the time, my sleep is affected, and my heart feels likes it’s in overdrive. I don’t think it’s winter blues … cold, clouds and rain don’t bother me generally. It’s very concerning but the feeling goes away in some days.<|im_end|>

It would’ve been helpful to know more about the event that occurred eight years ago. It sticks in your mind as a possibility. It “devastated” you. It’s highly possible that this event is the cause of the problem but without more information, it’s difficult for me to know.You specifically asked whether or not you are “subconsciously” remembering this event every year. If you remember it, then it is not “subconscious.” The fact that you do remember it would suggest that is a conscious memory.Seasonal depression is also a possibility that should be explored. It’s not uncommon for some people to be depressed in the winter. It’s dreary, cold and dark. It can cause sadness and an overall sense of apathy. However, it’s equally possible that the event that occurred eight years ago, is the source of the problem.It would be wise to consult a mental health professional in this matter. It could help you to understand why you repeatedly feel a particular way during the same time period each year. Therapy will very likely assist you in remedying this problem.

Thank you in advanced for taking the time to look at my posting. Since I was around twelve years old I have always seemed depressed or down about myself, seems as if I’m always the smaller person at times. This i can say occurred because of my crumbling family life after my dad abandoned me and left me with my mother as a pre-teen. Now I’ve taken control of my own life and going to college and i can say I’m not what i used to be like.

 I hope you give yourself lots of credit for taking charge of yourself and your life. Good for you!Believe it or not, sometimes the very best time to go into therapy is when we are feeling good about successes in life. I’s a time when we have confidence and strength that can help us deal with some tough issues.In your case, I’m guessing there is some unresolved anger and grief about your father’s abandonment and the breakup of your family. You have managed to put those feelings aside and to develop friendships and to go for your professional goals. You could leave it at that. But I think the depression you experience is your inner self telling you that you have some psychological work to do.From my point of view, it’s important that you do it. You don’t deserve to be haunted for the rest of your life. Further, your feelings about how your family disintegrated might get in the way of forming a trusting and loving relationship or connecting with your own kids someday.I have every reason to believe that you will be as successful in therapy as you’ve been in meeting your other goals. I hope you will follow up and make an appointment with a counselor soon.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My fiance has had an anxiety issue for almost a year now. It wasn’t until about 5 months ago that she made me quit my job and have her parents support me completely because she was unable to leave the house and would “freak” out when she was left alone. It is not that I have just quit my job I am also not able to leave the house for any reason but, to get her groceries occasionally. I am currently taking classes online but, it is diving me crazy I can’t do anything. I used to love going to the gym but, now I can only try to do a work out in the house. Is this something that is normal? Everyday I feel my life is being wasted. It’s not that I don’t have sympathy for what she is going through either. I want her to be healthy, productive, and happy again. I just feel as though my psychological needs are not being met at this time. So to sum it up my biggest concerns are:<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m sorry that your fiancé has such severe anxiety and it sounds like she has developed Agoraphobia. Anxiety disorders can be very serious and debilitating, but it is not ok that she is imposing her fears onto you as well. You have every right to be concerned and I would caution you about marrying someone who is making you change your behavior and lifestyle because of her fear, and furthermore, that her family appears to be supporting this.She needs to get help (therapy and medication) but part of her treatment needs to include couple’s therapy to address how unfair it is that she expects you to change your life to accommodate her illness. I don’t mean to sound unfeeling, but she is controlling you and that is not ok. Your job as a partner is to be empathetic, supportive, and even involved in her care when possible, but it should not require giving up your own life to do so.If she already has a therapist I would suggest that you attend a few sessions with her. If she doesn’t, I would encourage you to find one that will work with both of you, even if that means finding one willing to come to the house. If your fiancé cannot see how it is too much to expect you to stay home with her all the time, I would reconsider the marriage.All the best,<|im_end|>"

My mom and I have had issues for four years. They keep getting worse no matter what I try to do. She makes me feel worthless and yells at me over every simple mistake I make. She tells me I’m not going to have a future/ I won’t do anything with my life on a day to day basis. She makes me feel so bad about myself that I want to die and I feel unwanted. Because of this and other problems I self harm a lot and I sometimes have suicidal thoughts although I don’t think It would come to that. I tried to run away from home last year because it got so bad and it only made it worse. I also have tried not talking to my mom but she always finds something to yell at me for. She hasn’t spoken to me like a real person in a long time because she always yells. She’s told me that she hates me and loves my brother and sister more than me and tells me how much of a disappointment I am. I want to get help to make me feel better and stop her from saying these things to me but I don’t want her to know she is why I want help. I also am too afraid to talk to any counselors at school or my friends about it because I think they won’t believe me and will think I’m being a moody teenager. I’m scared to ask for help from anyone I know because they would think of me different and judge me. Please tell me what I should do about this.<|im_end|>

 You should speak to the school counselor about this issue. You have nothing to fear. Counselors don’t judge people. It is their job to help people. They spend years rigorously training to help people who are having problems just like yours. They can help you if you ask.You are concerned that the counselors will see you as simply a “moody teenager.” You seem to be worried that you will not be taken seriously. I don’t think that will happen. Moody teenagers don’t engage in self-harm or have suicidal thoughts and counselors know this. They can’t help you if you don’t tell them what’s wrong.As soon as you have the opportunity, speak to your school counselor. Tell him or her about what you wrote in this letter. If it’s easier, take this letter with you. It might help the counselor begin to understand how you are feeling. I hope that you will take my advice and realize that you have nothing to fear. Help is available but you have to be willing to ask for it, to receive it. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My mother has never been able to be nice to my husband. She often says mean and hurtful things to him, or when she says them to me and he defends me she accuses him of “attacking” her. The relationship has not been good, and since we have gotten married it has gotten worse. As expected, now that we are about to have a child in less than two months, it has become even harder. At a recent holiday event, my mother ignored my husband completely. She pretended as if he were not there. When I confronted her about this behavior, she denied it; then later said it was because she was angry about a decision we had made (to drive to his parents house); then later denied it, and so on. After a fight between her and I ensued, and I told her that whether she likes him or hates him she must AT LEAST treat my husband with respect. I also told her that I would refuse to speak with her until she apologized to him. Four days and many hurtful emails later she sent him an email which read only: I’m sorry I ignored you on the holiday. The sad part is that no one was expecting a sincere apology, because she believes in her heart that she had every right to treat him that way. She also was humiliated that I told her to apologize, because that would mean admitting responsibility. I don’t want my child to see her treat its father this way, and I don’t want my child to think that this behavior is acceptable to give out or receive. What should I do?<|im_end|>

 You’ve made a good start. You drew a boundary and stuck to it. It sounds to me like your mother may be competing with your husband for your time, attention, and love. Is it possible that she feels there isn’t room in your heart for both of them? If so, the problem to address is her insecurity. I wonder if the situaiton will get better or worse once your child is born. Sometimes the desire to be part of a grandchild’s life makes someone like your mom start to behave. But if she is worried there isn’t enough love to go around, she may compete with the child too.If you think she’s insecure, try to work on that problem directly. Make sure to give her attention when she is doing things right. Give her random “I love yous.” Catch her and praise her whenever she is doing something right. Reassure her that you can love both her and your growing family.If, on the other hand, she’s just one of those mean-spirited people who targets others, keep doing what you started. Make it clear what you will and won’t accept and mean it. Don’t argue. Arguing implies you can be talked out of something. Simply state clearly what is and isn’t okay. When she acts up, leave without further comment. You’ve already told her what’s unacceptable so engaging in yet another conversation about it only gives her attention for the wrong thing.I hope your mother responds. Life is too short. She has the opportunity to have a loving relationship with a daughter, her son-in-law and their children. What a shame if she can’t appreciate that.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 What you are describing may be social anxiety. People who suffer from social anxiety are worried that other people are judging them negatively and may reject them. This leads to self-consciousness and feelings of embarrassment and sometimes depression. Often it leads to the person deciding it’s better to just be alone. Sadly, this makes the situation even worse because being alone leads to being lonely and more depressed.Your appearance is not the problem. Your lack of self-confidence is. I’m sure there are many people in the world who would find your look interesting and attractive. But they can’t “see” you if you are hiding behind your shyness and low self-esteem.There are limits to how much we can change our appearance. But there are no limits to what we can do to change our self-esteem.The key is to get out of worrying about yourself and instead to focus on what you can do for others. People with high self-esteem are people who work to make a difference in the world. Find a cause you believe in and volunteer. You will find other people who are also involved in making the world a better place and who will be happy to have your help. Don’t wait to have self-confidence to do this. That’s not the way it works. The self-confidence is a result, not a cause, of doing good.I also encourage you to look into joining one of the forums here at PsychCentral. People from all over the world offer each other support and advice while they work on themselves.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Keeping in mind that I attend one of the best schools in my country, that I have excellent living conditions and that everybody who lives in my house has everything they need, I should not have a reason to feel this way… but still, my friends and other family members all have a great amount of wealth that makes me feel self-conscious of my where I live, what I do, how I dress and the things I own. I am constantly pretending to be someone I’m not so that others can assume that I have this same wealth that everybody seems to have. All of this has accumulated and affected with my self-esteem, which has always been pretty bad, but recently I have not been able to control it or to ignore it, making me feel worthless and ashamed.<|im_end|>

Thank you for writing. Your letter tells me that you are an especially sensitive and caring person. I don’ t think this is a self-esteem issue. I think it is a reflection of your sensitivity. You are not alone in your struggles with being privileged. Many teens and young adults who are so fortunate to be wealthy feel conflicted about it. They know they haven’t done anything themselves to earn it. Often they wonder if they could have gained the same comfort if they had had to do it on their own. Doubt about their own abilities and the awareness that others haven’t been as lucky results in what looks very much like a self-esteem problem.Having as much as you do when so many other people in the world don’t have enough is a burden as well as a gift. It calls on you to figure out what you can do to feel that you are using your wealth to be helpful to others.Yes, there are wealthy people who never seem to have enough to feel good. They try to fill a hole in their self-regard by having multiple homes, big cars and fancy clothes and fancier parties. But it’s not a strategy that works. They only continue to feel empty. So they continue to accumulate more money and more material things. It never seems to be enough.People with wealth who feel good about themselves are those who put a substantial part of it into doing good in the world. Often it starts out modestly with volunteering at someplace that serves others less fortunate. As people find a cause that touches their heart, they put more of their time and money into it. Doing good is what makes people feel good. It’s that simple.I don’t think you need a psychologist — though a therapist might give you some needed encouragement.I do think you need to find a  more supportive boyfriend. Your guy is too concerned with appearances. A quality guy would be much more interested in your values and your empathy. Take a step back from this relationship and make yourself available so you can find someone with better values. You deserve it.I also think you need to take some steps to make yourself feel like you are doing something worthwhile with your good fortune. Choose something that really touches your heart. I’m betting you will soon feel better.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I would suggest talking to the school guidance counselor or another trusted member of the faculty. Describe your symptoms. In addition, discuss the fact the you have brought your concerns to your parents but they have been nonresponsive. The guidance counselor can either speak to your parents on your behalf or advise you about how to approach them.If what you are experiencing is normal, then you have no problem. If what you are experiencing is not normal then you have a problem. No problem should be ignored. Most will respond best to immediate treatment. The issue here is whether or not you have a problem and if so what the problem is. Parents sometimes minimize their child’s problems because they are worried and hope that the problem will simply go away. Sometimes it does but for the sake of safety no problem should be ignored.An alternative way to approach this situation may be to suggest that your parents take you to your primary care physician (PCP). You can say something like “Mom, I’m having a tough time lately and I would feel much better if I had the opportunity to report my symptoms to a doctor. Let’s let the doctor decided if I have a problem or not.”During the appointment, report your symptoms to the doctor. He or she will likely want to investigate your symptoms further. The doctor will also want to involve your parents.The purpose of this approach is twofold: it allows you to be evaluated by a physician and secondly, the doctor can serve as an advocate for treatment. If the doctor is concerned about your symptoms, then this increases the likelihood that your parents will take you seriously.I hope this helps. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I am wondering if this is normal or something that I should be concerned about (To be clear, I’m not afraid for safety.), if it’s an issue that needs attention. My husband has ocd, ADHD, and a mild form of turrets. He doesn’t like wetness (no wet kisses, absolutely zero desire to have anything to do with a vagina). He’s a butt liking guy. He seems to be put off by sex itself as he wants to converse the entire time about my thong and sometimes even pretending to have one of us get shot or stabbed in the belly. Nothing can be mentioned about sex. It’s all about the thong, and scenarios of getting stabbed or shot. He can’t keep an erection without this. It’s so unfulfilling for me as I only have my imagination that he’s being normal, passionate and enjoying all of me in bed. For me to get anywhere myself, I need this imagination and certain maneuvers for stimulation. When he requires constant talking from me, I can’t even have that. (Though he gets upset if I don’t climax first. This gentleman way of letting the girl go first is sweet, but he doesn’t help in any way other than thrusting. I’ve tried to talk about it, it’s like asking a favor that he can’t stand doing, which kills it.) I don’t know why he is so put off by sex and my female parts. I know it’s not me. I know that I am fun, kinky, clean and full of passion. There has got to be something that is making him like this, either from a genetic reason or an experience in his life, or both. I need advice and someone to help me understand what it is that he has, a mental or sexual disorder? He’s also a high functioning alcoholic and mentally and psychologically controlling and abusive sometimes as well, if that information helps. I need to understand what I’m dealing with here as I don’t know what to do.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
If the information that you have provided me is correct, then you are dealing with a very complex problem which is unlikely to offer an easy fix. From your description, he is an alcoholic, he is abusive and he is controlling. You say that you are not concerned with your safety, however when dealing with an alcoholic one should always be concerned for one’s safety. He also has Tourette’s, ADHD, and OCD. He is also sexually incompatible with you and your desires. If you were aroused to the type of sex that he desires the two of you would have a good sex life, but that would do nothing to diminish any of his diagnosable mental problems, his alcoholism or his tendency to be abusive and controlling.You described him as being a functional alcoholic but he does not appear to be functioning well in life in general. Without extensive therapy it is very unlikely that he will improve in any aspect of his life. Many women would leave a man who was abusive. Many women would leave a man who was a long functioning alcoholic. Many women would leave a man who had fantasies of stabbing or being stabbed in the stomach.Your happiness is as important as his happiness. I doubt sincerely, that you both can walk the same path to happiness. It is most likely that each of you will need to find separate paths to happiness.It may be time for you to realize that he is not a common, normal, alcoholic guy with Tourette’s, ADHD, OCD, who is also abusive, controlling and repulsed by female genitalia. I wish you the very best of luck, in whatever decision you make.<|im_end|>"

From a teen girl in the U.S.: I haven’t been able to interact with people normally at any point in my life. When I was in elementary school I was extremely aggressive and prone to tantrums far past the age where that behavior is normal. This behavior continued into jr high and high school. My tantrums went from scratching my arms up and screaming to punching myself, banging my head on walls, hitting myself in the face, biting my arms and making non human sounds. I’ve never had control of these outbursts. They’re almost always triggered by other people, especially if I’m cornered or they stand to close to me. They’re embarrassing, I have no control over them, I’m an adult woman, I don’t want to have temper tantrums like a 5 year old.<|im_end|>

I’m very glad you wrote to us. You have suffered with this long enough. You know that. You also know that 6 months of treatment isn’t going to be enough to get to the bottom of whatever is troubling you.Here’s what you can do differently: Go back to the therapist you felt most comfortable with. Take your letter with you to show her. Chances are the therapist didn’t understand the depth of your problems because you were too afraid to talk about it. As a result, you probably weren’t accurately diagnosed. An accurate diagnosis is essential to getting good treatment.You are right to be concerned about yourself. You are also absolutely right to want a normal life. The place to start is with an honest talk with the person who can help you.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I’m 13. I’ve been diagnosed with Depression. Something I’ve been told I’ve had since I was seven. I’m thirteen now, and am currently on anti-depressants and sleeping tablets. I feel as though they are not helping me. If anything they are making me feel worse. My life seems to be on the up now, compared to how it was but my moods and feelings and actions are worse than before. I’m continuously angry and looking in the mirror telling myself I’m fat and ugly and after most meals I feel sick, and then make myself sick. Not after every meal, only some. I am also suicidal.. My sisters are not very supportive. One of them don’t believe me when I talk to her, the others don’t care and call me names. I self harm. I want to make the physical pain match the emotional pain. What can I do to stop these thoughts, being sick, and self harm? Help please.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Thank you so much for writing. I’m glad you are thinking about whether your medications are helpful. Sometimes medications help. Sometimes they don’t. The first thing you need to do is have an honest talk with whomever is prescribing the medications. He or she needs to know how you are reacting to them. Fortunately, there are a number of medications that do much the same thing. Sometimes a person responds better to one than another. Do talk it over.Then, and most important, you need to be talking with a mental health counselor, not just taking medication. The treatment of choice for depression is a combination of talk and medicine, then weaning away from the medication if you can. There are techniques you can learn to stop the negative thoughts and to help yourself with the impulse to self-harm with what is an emerging eating disorder. At only 13, you need to put the brakes on both immediately.While you look for a counselor, there are online sources of help you can access. In the States, the Boys and Girls Club hotline (800-448-3000) and chatline is there 24/7 to help kids like you. In the UK, the crisis line is 08457-90-90-90.You took an important first step in taking care of yourself by writing to us here at PsychCentral. Now please do take the next step and get the support and help you need.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hi, I am a senior in high school in a small town..I have struggled with depression, anxiety, panic, and eating disorders since I was 13 years old. And my family just doesn’t seem to understand what I am going through,they act like its just something that i can automaticly turn off my emotions and be happy but thats not the case.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
What a sad, sad story. It’s hard enough to be struggling with so many inner demons without having to struggle with the family too. All I can guess is that your siblings are angry that you take up a lot of family energy and that maybe your parents feel helpless to help you. Sometimes when people feel angry and helpless, they would rather blame or exclude the person they can’t help than face their own feelings of powerlessness or failure. Whatever the reason, this is a miserable situation all around. No one in this family sounds really happy and you have become the family scapegoat.In order to build up your self-identity, getting yourself in treatment is the first part of the equation. You have far too many troubles for someone who is only in her teens to handle by herself. You’re right. You can’t just switch off your problems. But a therapist could help you learn to manage your feelings and could work with you and your family to change your role in the family.If you are not seeing a therapist, please talk with your family doctor or your school guidance counselor to help you find one. If you are in treatment, I hope you are telling the therapist what you told me. A therapist can only work with what she or he is told.As noted on the Cyber Bulling Research Center’s website, “We have to try to get to a point where our identity isn’t completely wrapped up in how others perceive us. And this is so hard. Most adults haven’t gotten to a good place with this yet. But we know our own feelings and emotions and opinions – we can’t fully trust them. They change all the time. That’s how it is for everybody. And if our identity – who we know we are – is constantly dependent on what other people are saying about us, it is going to be a really rough life. You won’t ever fully “own” who you are. You’ll be at the mercy of catering to the thoughts and feelings and opinions and pressures and demands of others. And this is an awful way to live. You have got to get your identity from something stable. Something unchanging. Something that can tell you who you are, where you can believe it and be forever sure about it. And then, when you can get that into your heart, fully and truly, you can live your life out of it. And then life honestly becomes so much better.”I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: My husband and I have been married for 4 years and we have a house together. We both work and are engineers. Unfortunately, due to economy, he lost his job and because of this he was involved in a gray area business. Now, he is about to be charged with a felony. His lawyer proposed that he should get a job as soon as possible before he gets charged. However, he can’t find a job where we currently live. Instead, he was able to find a job in his hometown in another state. Conveniently, the job is so close to his parents’ house. This is where I have a problem.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Your husband did not get into a “gray area” because he lost his job. He did something illegal because he was unable to hold onto his ethics and was willing to take the risk. Since he persists in seeing his mother as a “saint,” it isn’t healthy for him to live with her as she will support him in denying responsibility. Not questioning his mother’s view of him as perfect is partly what got him into this fix. It may be a relief to him to have more contact with his mother with whom he doesn’t have to deal with the blame and shame that go with his actions, but it won’t be helpful to his personal growth.The problem you both face now is not where he lives, but whether he is willing to grow up and man up. That means accepting responsibility for his actions. That means making it clear to his mother that (a) he did make a serious mistake and (b) that she must be respectful of the woman he married. If he can’t be an upstanding citizen and a loyal husband when in the orbit of his mother, then he should put some distance between them by looking for other jobs. But that only takes care of the immediate problem. The more pressing issue is whether you are married to a guy who is worthy of your respect.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hi, I am 15 years old and about three months ago I had a “Panic Attack” in bed at night. Since then at night-time I have this extreme fear. This includes heart palpation, trembling, numbing in hands and feet, fast breathing, fearful thoughts such as someone breaking in, ghosts creepy dolls you name it! I also sweat and feel extreme nausea the whole time. Because of this, trying to sleep is a problem as I can’t stop thinking of the fear, I can’t close my eyes for more than 5 seconds and if I want to sleep I have to have a video on and sometimes my lamp on though sometimes it is impossible to shut my mind off. It used to be much worse than now as I don’t have it regularly and can kind of control it but i do have my days. From what I have googled I cannot find many people with the same problem. I also have experienced waking up with my whole body numb, with loud ringing in my ears heart pounding and difficulty breathing. It is like I am in a bag as I feel detached from reality. When it is over however it feels like it never happened (btw I can move a bit but very difficult) it has happened twice but it terrifies me . I also have no idea what that is and when I went to the doctor he was not helpful AT ALL. I have been to counseling but the problem has not been solved. I get very stressed easily and have my fair share of anxiety in the day too. I am quite a healthy in size yet I don’t exercise and my diet could be better. I am just wondering what the fear at night is and if it may be possibly linked to stress during the day. Thanks a lot for taking your time to read this. (age 15, from New Zealand)<|im_end|>

 What you are describing here sounds like you may have developed Panic Disorder. You report that you had a panic attack in bed and since then these other fears have developed. Part of Panic Disorder is fear of having another one, but many of the symptoms are very physical — like the ones you describe. Once you are worried and fearful, the fears can take on many forms and can worsen and change over time.I’m glad that you are in counseling and have spoken to your doctor but am concerned that you feel like it hasn’t helped. Please let both your counselor and doctor know how serious and frequent your symptoms are. You may need to go on medication for a time while you learn other techniques to get your symptoms under control. Learning deep breathing techniques through meditation or yoga can be immensely helpful, as well as other relaxation exercises. I often suggest clients get a self-help book, such as The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook, to help broaden your tool kit and teach skills that you can use anywhere. You might also look into joining a group or taking a class that is geared in this direction, as well as getting some guided imagery or guided meditation cd’s to listen to before going to bed.Anxiety disorders can be very serious and very frightening, but the good news is that they are very treatable. I hope you feel better soon.All the best,<|im_end|>"

Adult son 23 has been depressed for years. Not moving forward with his life. My husband and I took a NAMI class (12 weeks) and am starting to understand that he may be bipolar ll. He refuses help from psychologists or psychiatrists. Doesn’t feel they can help. Feels that the US is caught up in political wrongdoings and it is going to wreck our world. Constantly checking phone to find out political happenings. Says he is a nihilist and no psychologist around our area can help him. What is the purpose of moving forward. He is living at home with his us (parents) and having a hard time. No friends around (all off to college), bored, sleeps alot, not working. Is going to try to take classes in Jan but this will be his 3rd attempt-first two he got too depressed to finish-even though he had good grades. He thinks school is his only hope. My question-how do you help someone with this mentality? I feel like there is no hope. He constantly does things to self-sabotage and is not helping himself. Just too depressed to help himself. Is there any online counseling? The problem is he is very smart and has been able to manipulate other counselors into thinking nothing is wrong-or he is pretty ok. Which isn’t the case. Any suggestions would be helpful. Thank you.<|im_end|>

The question is, is his depression a cause or an effect. The chicken or the egg. Which came first? Certainly, his multiple failures in life and lack of success would cause depression. Depression as an illness and cause, would cause failures in life. No one will be able to tell you which is the cause and which is the effect.There are basically only two possible treatments. If his depression is based on a physical problem, then only a physical treatment will be effective. Physical treatment, would consist of drug therapy or ECT. The only nonphysical treatment would be talk therapy of some sort.Your problem appears deeper. Your son refuses treatment. How can you possibly think that he might improve without treatment of any sort? You are willing to help him with his treatment but he rejects your help and refuses to attempt to help himself. Refusing mental health treatment, keeps many obviously psychotic persons on the street, where many end up homeless, imprisoned, or dead.Your son should not have the right to reject treatment. Legally he does but legally he has no right to receive money from you nor the right to live in your home. I know that your only concern is helping your son but that is not always easy. Many books have been written on the subject of tough love. If you haven’t read them, you should. For parents that have practiced tough love, they know how very difficult and painful it was for them to accept the idea that the only way to help their child or tried to help their child, was to practice tough love. They did not practice tough love because they had little love for their child, they paid, instead, a heavy price emotionally because they loved their child so much. It became clear to them that the only way to help their child and possibly save their child’s life, was to take control and instill rules that the child must follow or the child would no longer receive any help of any kind, from them. No money. No place to live. Nothing.Hundreds, if not thousands of books have been written on the subject of tough love. My several paragraphs has made no attempt to fully explain it and I have no expectations that I have done even a modest job of explaining tough love.Speaking of tough love, here’s a tough question for you. Are you his enablers? The concept of enablers has been well-established, documented and proven in drug therapy. In almost every case, someone has enabled the alcoholic to survive as an alcoholic. Are you enabling your child to reject therapy?I have made it perfectly clear in the answers that I have provided in print, for many years, that I cannot diagnose over the Internet and I cannot. In addition, I don’t know anyone who actually can. There are those who say that they can and in addition there are those who say the earth is flat.Though I cannot diagnose over the internet, I can share with you my experiences. I have dealt with many persons who are your son’s age and younger, who are depressed because their life is not moving forward as they had expected and hoped. Their depression was removed as their life improved and their successes increased. As you pointed out, your son has friends who are moving forward and are being successful in life. How does that make your son feel?Your son doesn’t have the answers, obviously, or he would cure his own depression. Rejecting therapy, could not possibly be the right choice. With therapy he has the chance to improve. Without therapy, well you can see the results in your son’s lasting depression. You say your son is intelligent. I will accept that. Please also accept the fact that therapists are highly skilled and are of high intelligence. They have succeeded in college. They have succeeded in being accepted into a graduate program and they have proven their intellectual ability.A non-cooperative client, someone who doesn’t want to be there, can mislead a therapist but cannot deceive a therapist, over time. Not all car mechanics are equal. Some are much better than others and our life experience shows that to be true. Maybe all therapists are qualified to repair cars but some are just much better at it. Perhaps, he just hasn’t found the right therapist. No more qualified, no more intelligent, just not the one that he “clicks” with. Moral of this answer? Don’t stop trying, in fact try much harder. I wish you the best of luck.<|im_end|>"

My boyfriend has periods when he gets insecure and jealous that he becomes very different and thinks there is a secret among the rest of the world that he isn’t included in regarding hooking up. He also sees words as code. He’ll look at my email spam and for instance if the word is Float, he thinks each letter stands for another word.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It is possible that your boyfriend may be experiencing delusional disorder but only an in-person, psychiatric evaluation could confirm that diagnosis. Two possible signs of the disorder include his belief that words, as “codes”, have a hidden meaning and his paranoia with regard to you cheating. The fact that he had an ex-wife who cheated may make him hypersensitive to the possibility of cheating but his intense focus on your alleged infidelity is unusual.Delusional disorder is a type of mental illness that involves psychosis. Psychosis is a break with reality. Psychosis involves the inability to distinguish what is real from what is not real. A delusion is the belief that something is real, despite evidence to the contrary.Individuals with delusional disorders experience “non-bizarre delusions.” An example of a non-bizarre delusion is the belief that someone is being poisoned, followed, conspired against, or admired from a distance. There are six main types of delusions associated with delusional disorders. Jealous is one of them. Individuals experiencing a jealous type of delusion believe that their partner or spouse is cheating in the absence of evidence to support their belief.If your partner is willing, he should undergo a psychiatric evaluation by a mental health professional. With regard to psychotic disorders, treatment is particularly important because generally, delusions do not go away on their own. They can become worse in frequency and in intensity. Medication could reduce or eliminate his delusions. It may not be easy to convince him to see a mental health professional but it would be in his best interest.Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My 2 best friends have been ignoring me for the past 4 weeks and I just spoke to both of them. They both said they don’t want to be friends anymore.

I’m currently on the floor crying because I did nothing to deserve this and we were all fine the day before. I simply hung out with one friend after school twice and she got annoyed with me and wanted to be alone yet didn’t tell me.

 I am so sorry to hear that your friends are treating you so poorly. I know how devastating it can feel when the people in our life change for no apparent reason. I wouldn’t try to change their opinion or get more information. Instead I would keep developing the other friendships you have and put your effort into developing new ones. Your profile says that you are in 9th grade, and by the sound of it this is the first time you’ve been hurt in this way. One of the lessons in life that most of us have to learn is how to walk away from situations that come out of the blue, don’t make a lot of sense, and have hurt us. By putting your effort into current and future friendships you will be learning how to not to lose yourself when others treat you badly.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I am 23 years old, and a female. I have never been in a romantic, sexual relationship with any man (although I have kissed many and really enjoyed it). I knew my whole life that I was emotionally and physically attracted to men. I know that I have always wanted to marry a man. I have never had, nor am I a crushing on a girl. I have only ever wanted to be in an emotional intimate relationship with a man. However, I feel aroused when I watch two women having sex, which scares and confuses me. Over the last week I have this screaming thought in my head that I am gay, and I can’t seem to get rid of it no matter how hard I try. However the thought of being romantically attached and in a relationship with a women repulses me and makes me sick. I feel extreme anxiety, and it has severely changed my sleeping and eating patterns. I am up all night wondering if I am gay as well as wondering if I will ever have any romantic attachment with a man. As soon as I try and convince myself that I am straight, I panic and feel like I’m lying to myself, and tell myself that I am deep in denial. Every time I go out, I am scared that I will see a girl and fall in love with her and lose all my interest in men, which scares me even more. I came across information about HOCD, and immediately identified with of all the emotional and physical experiences that other people went through, which made me feel a bit more calm. But now I have started to convince myself that what I identified with when I read HOCD was a lie and that deep down I am a closeted gay (even though I know that’s not true). I have spoken to my mother and a few of my friends about how I am feeling which helps me feel less stressed but five minutes later to an hour I convince myself that all I have said was a lie and I am deep in denial, which makes me more depressed.  I don’t know what I am feeling and it scares the hell out of me. I feel like I have lost my identity. I was wondering if there was any techniques that I could use to make me feel calm and think rationally. I would love to see a therapist but I have too many other expenses in my life so I can’t afford it. Please help me. I want to feel the way I used to, which was excited at the prospect of meeting a man and falling completely in love with them, and not depressed and repulsed by the thought of falling in love with a woman.

 Thank you for writing in with your question about what some refer to as Homosexual Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (HOCD). Anxiety disorders can seem to come out of nowhere and can be quite confusing when the focus of your anxiety doesn’t make rational sense to you, such as someone who has a phobia of an animal that they have never seen or encountered. However, as severe as anxiety disorders can be, they are very treatable.The fact that you have never experienced romantic or sexual feelings for people of the same gender and you have never wondered if you might be homosexual, suggests that this is more about a phobic fear than your sexual orientation. Also, the fact that the thoughts came on suddenly and are obsessive in nature lends more support to them being anxiety related.As much as possible, put your fears about your sexuality aside and get back to the act of just living your life. The right relationship for you will present itself in time. This task would easier and/or quicker with the help of a therapist but you may be able to find some relief on your own. I would suggest doing some research on the technique of “thought stopping” and just general cognitive interventions for the obsessive part of OCD. If you can’t afford therapy right now, purchasing a well-reviewed book or workbook written by one might suffice. However, consulting with a therapist or psychiatrist for even a few sessions may be enough to help you get back on track.All the best,<|im_end|>"

Just when I thought I’ve won the seemingly endless battle against my OCD by triumphing over my eating disorder (anorexia, to be specific), common symptoms (checking the switches countless times, washing my hands forever, hoarding) and gotten a hold over my rampaging thoughts, I had a severe panic attack a few days ago.<|im_end|>

 Among OCD sufferers, specifically among those with health-related anxieties, often no amount of reassurance is ever enough. In fact, the act of seeking reassurance can make OCD worse. It temporarily decreases anxiety but it reinforces the seeking reassurance behavior. OCD sufferers should resist the urge to seek reassurance and endure their anxiety. If an individual usually seeks reassurance when they feel anxious then not doing so will increase their anxiety, possibly to very intense levels but those levels cannot be sustained. Anxiety always decreases. In that way, anxiety is akin to the law of gravity: what goes up must come down. Individuals with OCD are unwilling to endure their anxiety. They do everything in their power to escape it. This is a mistake. Anxiety avoided in the short run, only intensifies it in the long run.You may be overreacting to the IPL treatment. Your level of concern in any situation should match the most likely outcome. The professional advice you sought supports the idea that your level of concern should be minimal. You minimize the doctor’s advice but focus intensively on the outcome that frightens you the most. You must get in the habit of basing your reactions on the reality of a situation, on the truth. This is essential to overcoming OCD. What one feels to be true may be very different from what actually is true. I understand that changing thought patterns is not an easy task. It is a skill that you can learn with practice and professional help.Congratulations on working through anorexia but OCD can be equally as problematic. Both anorexia and OCD are control disorders. Sufferers are attempting to gain control of their lives but no one with either disorder effectively achieves this outcome. If you haven’t done so already, please seek counseling for your OCD. Very effective treatments exist for OCD, one of the best being exposure and response prevention therapy. The find help tab at the top of this page can help you locate a therapist in your community.

If I had the opportunity to interview you, I would want to know more about your personal life history. You stated that you have no mental illnesses with the exception of minor anxiety. What about trauma? Any unpleasant experiences with your family? Are you a victim of abuse? Those types of questions, and many more regarding your history, would need to be answered in order to explain “why” you feel the way you do.Often, people who have interests similar to yours have had a traumatic history. Certainly, that’s not the case with everyone but many individuals who have the desire to harm others have been hurt themselves.It is not the norm to want to “rape” children. It is unusual to want to murder your family and to like the idea of doing so. It is abnormal to both have fantasies about sex with animals and to carry out the act. All of these things are morally wrong and illegal.Individuals who are attracted to children are referred to as pedophiles. Individuals who are diagnosed with pedophilia have met the following diagnostic criteria:The most concerning aspect of your letter is that you know these things are wrong but still like the idea of them. It’s also concerning that you acted out one of your fantasies. This demonstrates your willingness to abuse less powerful others.Legally, engaging in sexual behavior with an animal is referred to as bestiality. In the mental health literature, it’s referred to as zoophilia. The research about these topics is scarce, but the early work suggests that approximately three to eight percent of the population may engage in sex with animals. Though there is no single profile of offenders, most are white males between the ages of 30 and 50 whose first sexual encounter with an animal occurs around the age of 13. From a psychological perspective, little else is known about this topic.Bestiality is illegal in the United States. In many states, it is a misdemeanor charge but many states are attempting to increase the penalties by classifying it as a felony offense. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) now collects data on animal cruelty. Intentionally harming animals is strongly correlated with violence against people.For the sake of innocent children and animals, it is of the utmost importance that you do everything in your power to ensure that you never hurt a child or an animal. I would strongly recommend consulting a mental health professional. These problems can be managed with counseling. If you do not have children (it was unclear as written), I would advise against having children until these problems are resolved. Without the right help, you are at risk of engaging in behaviors that could lead to a lifetime of incarceration and or the harm of innocent others. Counseling can assist you in developing strategies for preventing sexual offending or engaging in violence against people and animals. Good luck and please take care.<|im_end|>"

So I want to get back with my daughter’s father. We broke up originally because I cheated which was my mistake. Please, no bashing I suffered enough already. Point what I am getting to is I moved 1000kms away from him because of the fights and accusations and threats that was happening. So I moved to my parents it has been One and a Half months since the fights we both want to get back together and his family wants me home too, as I was living with him for almost a year. Now that we have sorted things out through numerous phone calls and text messages we have decided to leave the past behind us, but my parents don’t want to leave it there, they keep saying that everyone is going to try to take my child away from me because I’m “mentally unstable” truth of the matter is I have anger issues and when I get angry it gets ugly. But my parents refuse to let me go back home to my daughter’s father and we want to get back together I need some advice on how to go about everything. (From South Africa)<|im_end|>

Wanting to move back isn’t enough. Other than feeling bad and wanting to go back, what have you done to change? Anger management takes work, and saying you are going to put it behind you without developing any tools to keep it behind you isn’t likely to work. You need tools, you need strategies for coping, and learning how to prevent something else, like another affair when you get angry, from happening again.Since your parents have offered to take you in with your daughter take this time to get some therapy and learn how to manage your emotions. Once you’ve taken care of this moving back will be easier — and more likely to work.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I don’t know how I feel; my feelings and actions are confusing to me. Okay. So this is probably going to be long and confusing for everyone reading this. I have a hard time expressing my feelings, and maybe it’s genetic because apparently my mother is the same way. My family has never been terribly close, and I have lived out if home with my boyfriend for a year or so before (I like to he independent), although I’m back home now. Here are some characteristics that I know about myself, I’m kind of a tom boy, I’ve always gotten along better with boys than girls, I feel I have to be the strong one, and don’t want to show my feelings in front of other people, I also do not like being the center of attention. I have very poor concentration and memory (possibly due to ADD but the symptoms only appeared a few years back); I have little memory before the age of 7. And up until junior high I don’t have very clear memories but I can remember things if people say something that reminds me, very different from memories of when I was younger where I don’t recall major things. I don’t think I had a bad childhood that could have affected me, even when I think about the worst parts I don’t really care, (divorced parents, little money, unhealthy father, abusive mother, sexually abused by brother(s)? not sure if more than one, I even watched my friends father die (heart attack) and it didn’t phase me. kind of sounds like bragging huh.). Every once in a while, it seems things just build up, although I’m not sure what things, and I have a bit of a breakdown. I used to cut (more of for something to do and attention, although I didn’t let anyone find out) and feel suicidal just because I didn’t feel that there was anything for me to do in this world, I felt what was the point of growing up if you’re just going to work for so many years doing the same thing over and over, and then die. Sometimes I still feel this way, like life is pointless. I do enjoy drinking and prescription pills just because it is something to do that makes me happy, and makes my day less dull. I have an extremely hard time interpreting my feelings, I don’t know if I’m happy or depressed or confused, I know I have a bit of anxiety I inherited from my father, I have been on pills for it, and I liked that they made me feel numb which made me happier but I drank almost everyday. I didn’t want to stop the pills because it was a different kind of drunk but I had to because you aren’t supposed to mix them and I ended up in the hospital after a while. Sometimes I get into this sort of numb mood where I can just zoom through my days and not remember much without someone reminding me or thinking really hard about it, it’s usually when I’m down. Sometimes I don’t want to talk to anyone, and other times I want to be around everyone. I feel like I’m masking my happiness whenever I’m around people, maybe part of staying strong. Also, I’ve been to a therapist before I got anxiety pills, and I really wanted to talk but I couldn’t get myself to speak truthfully because I don’t like the idea of talking to someone who is paid for it and really doesn’t care about you as a person, it’s just their job. I have never talked to any of my close friends about these things because they come to me with their problems looking for advice, and I don’t want to burden them with my problems. The situation is the same for this one teacher who always looked out for me, and kind of knows how my life really is, and I always wanted to open to him about everything, but I can’t bring myself to make my problem his problem too. Anyways, I don’t even know what my problem is yet. I really hope people don’t just ignore this question, I don’t know what is wrong, but I can never seem to think as clearly as everyone else can, every one seems to he able to do things so much easier than I can. One last thing, hopefully I don’t remember anything else, I’ve noticed in my relationships at the beginning everything is wonderful, I want to be with them and be affectionate, but then suddenly, not gradually, my feelings change, and everything about them bothers me, and I turn into a bitch and pick them apart constantly. I don’t want them to touch me or kiss me anymore; I don’t want to be around them at all. And then the relationship usually ends. One last thing, I have constant migraines or headaches everyday that the doctor said are tension headaches? That(s everything I can remember for now that I’m confused about. I’ll add more if I think of it. I just want to understand my own feelings.<|im_end|>

 Whew! It sounds like you have been doing a lot of thinking! I wouldn’t pretend to be able to respond adequately to all of what you are putting forward—but I do see a place where I think we could make some progress. That is your comment about the therapist who “really doesn’t care about you as a person, it’s just their job.”Therapists choose their profession because they do care about people and know how to help. You saying that you don’t want to go because you believe the therapist doesn’t care about people probably comes from the fact that in your family the people who were supposed to care for you properly failed at their job. You think the therapist won’t care enough either.My very strong suggestion is to give therapy another chance. Just do it for you—help yourself feel better by talking to someone who is trained to help. He or she is likely to do a far better job caring for you than you have said your family has done.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Is this “normal” or do I have a dysfunction? Sometimes, over nothing, after working myself up into almost unnoticeable stress — even to me — I lose it. I start screaming at the top of my lungs, tearing things apart, not quite smashing things and destroying everything, but I lose care and caution around things that I love like my drawings or my books and that usually ends up with them getting damaged in some ways. I have OCD and I think quite a high anger level but I rarely ever act on it, unless its once in a blue moon — like now. Otherwise, I am able to be very rational and breathe and calm down or do something else to preoccupy my mind. Usually outbursts of sadness or madness are about getting frustrated with my compulsion, but its never quite on scale to what I would call a mental breakdown (where I throw shit and scream and berate myself). I never do this in front of people, Im otherwise a very controlled person who can rationalize my way through my anger but Im wondering if I have maybe a personality disorder since these blue moon attacks can last for a long time until I break myself down into tears and hating myself and hitting myself (Ive spoken to a psychologist on and off for a few years and he said I might also be on the spectrum, idk)<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 These attacks might seem “blue moon” to you, but they are probably not. If you track your thoughts and behavior prior to these attacks, you would probably see a pattern. There’s typically a reason for outbursts of “sadness or madness.”The key to understanding this problem might lie in what you referred to as your compulsion. You mentioned having obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD ) so I am assuming that your compulsion is because of your OCD. If I were your therapist I would want to know more about your compulsion. What is it? How long have you had it? What about it makes you so upset?You asked the question is this “normal” or do you have a “dysfunction?” Normal is a term that is difficult to define because it means different things to different people, but generally it’s not “normal” to experience extreme anger or sadness unless an event or a set of circumstances arises that invokes or warrants such extreme emotions. For example, if your beloved pet passed away it would be “normal” to feel very sad. Extreme sadness under those circumstances would make sense.OCD is an anxiety disorder. Compulsions are a symptom of the disorder. Think of them as maladaptive attempts at managing high anxiety. Counseling can teach you strategies for properly managing high anxiety and ways to reduce and ultimately eliminate compulsions. OCD and most other anxiety disorders are highly treatable with therapy and medication. If you haven’t tried them, you should strongly consider it. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 You know the pain in your life. When you look at the world around you and the people that make it up, real people, people in television shows, people in the movies, it may seem that they have little pain and few problems. It may seem that their life is all positive and they are easily achieving their goals in life. The difference between them and you is that you have full access to your very real pain and no access, whatsoever, to their internal pain — the pain that they hide from the world.The truth is that life is hard and you can expect it to be a struggle. Look at all of the people, people who seem to have it all, rich and admired, famous and respected, who have committed suicide. From the outside, it seems as if they have achieved the ideal life, money, fame and success. It seems like that because we can’t see what exists inside their external façade.What are you comparing yourself to? Are you comparing yourself to the real person, who exists inside the external façade or are you comparing yourself to the external carefully crafted image?Movies and television shows do not represent reality. Those cool, competent, successful people are fictional characters created by writers to provide entertainment and profit for the sponsors of their products. Those characters do not accurately represent life.Life isn’t easy, but it is a blessing from God. If you deny the existence of God, at least we can agree that life is of immense value. You can find meaning and happiness in this world and you should. If you continue to try, you will. When something doesn’t work out for you in life or in other words when you fail at something, what does it mean?Here’s what it means. It means “nope, not that way.” Your failure is actually success in narrowing down the things that don’t work, i.e. the wrong ways. When a baby is learning to walk it falls down, it may cry or maybe not but it always gets back up. It will fall, again and again but eventually it will succeed. The baby doesn’t know how to walk and it’s finding out how not to and with every fall, it is moving closer to success.People aren’t born knowing how to be happy in life or to find their personal meaningfulness. Each path is different. There is no “normal.” There is no map to happiness for anyone. You must create that map and you will create it by using logic, good judgment and through experimentation. When you try something, after using your best judgment and reasoning, and you fail, what does that mean? It means “nope, not that way.” Take a lesson from the purity of the baby’s soul — cry a little if you must but get back up and keep trying. They eventually succeed and so will you.<|im_end|>"

 My amazing father set the standard for what I think I relationship should be like. Everyone I’ve ever dated has been a disappointment for me. I’ve had to break up with some of the sweetest guys I’ve ever met because I got to the point where I realized I was spending most of my time antagonizing over their flaws and I made myself (and them) miserable. I just can’t get over the high standard set for whom ever I spend the rest of my life with.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You state in your letter “set the standard for what I think a relationship should be like.” You know what your relationship was like with your father. You are an expert on him as a father. You also state that he was the most fantastic husband. Only his wife would be able to knowledgeably comment on his ability to be a husband. You experienced your father, as a father, directly. Your mother experienced your father as her husband, directly. You were a onlooker into their relationship. Your mother has been just an onlooker into the relationships with the men that you have dated. I’m sure that you would agree, that she had been just looking in from the outside. The complexities of your relationships with the men that you have dated are not available to her. There is a public and personal side to virtually every relationship.You mentioned how difficult it was for you to deal with your father’s death. It crippled your belief in God. You also said your father’s death was tragic. I think it is reasonable to conclude that you feel that your father’s death was very unfair. In your mind he is a victim. When you love someone very, very much, it is very natural to protect them at all costs. Many people would gladly give up their own life to protect someone that they love.It appears to me that you are protecting your father by protecting his memory. It is your way of continuing to protect him. Your mother, who is trying to protect you, gently reminds you that your father was not perfect. I would have to trust your mother’s judgment as to your father’s abilities as a husband. I would trust your judgment as to your father’s ability to be a father.The most important thing in life is to concur with reality. We must not see things as better than they are, nor worse. It is very natural for you to compare your boyfriends to your father. Sigmund Freud has long ago established this as fact.I would like to ask you a question and I will respect and accept your answer. You have an impression of your father that is based on his only living until you were only in seventh grade. You presently possess that impression. What if he were alive today? What if you had all of those additional years with him? You did quite a bit of maturing after seventh grade; everyone does. You were much more knowledgeable in high school than you were in grade school. You saw the world in a much more complex way in high school and college. Now here’s my question: do you think that your impression of your father would be different if he were alive at this moment?I have a few other questions that you might want to consider. Were you the perfect child? Do you think that your father would love you any less if you weren’t perfect? You know that your father loved you. You can feel it with every fiber of your being, even now. Those that you love, truly love, need not be perfect or even close.You have pointed out that you’re having relationship problems. You stated that it’s time to do something about that. I would recommend counseling and I would focus that counseling on grief. In closing, I would like to assure you that no imperfection that you were to discover about your father would ever diminish the love that you feel for him.You will find a list of therapists by clicking the “find help” tab at the topic of this page.

I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for almost two years now. I’m 19 and he is 21. To put it bluntly, he’s not the nicest guy. He calls me names and sometimes he’ll act controlling towards me. When I tell him I want to end our relationship, he’ll act like he doesn’t care which freaks me out enough that I never ACTUALLY end things. We’ve “broken up” before and I always contact him practically begging for him back because I literally go insane without him. It’s like I can’t breathe sometimes when I’m not with him and it is a dreadfully terrifying feeling. I have become completely dependent upon him for my happiness. The thing is, I know he treats me horribly. He loves to call me stupid and he gets angry at me now for practically no reason at all. The last reason he called me horrible, horrible names was because I didn’t respond to him quickly enough through text messages. Sometimes he’ll act like I’m not allowed to have my own opinion. He’ll threaten to break up with me if I don’t agree with him on something so I always end up agreeing even though I think otherwise. Lately, he has called me a bad name pretty much every day. He really never treats me well. I sympathize with him when he’s sad, I apologize when I do or say something wrong or rude, I try to talk rationally instead of calling him names. He never sympathizes with me, instead he’d choose to laugh at me. If someone does something to upset me, most of the time he’ll take their side. He very, very rarely apologizes. He’s probably apologized a total of 10 times in the entire two years that we’ve been together. He’s told me before that his ex is better than me and that he doesn’t actually love me. That he has just told me he does so I’ll be happy. With each new, horrible thing he says to me, I think to myself “this is the last straw, I will not put up with this anymore.” But then the next day I start to miss him and I contact him. It’s honestly like I cannot control myself. I know that this is bad and I know that I SHOULDN’T be with somebody like that but I feel that I’ve become so dependent on him that it’s nearly impossible for me to be without him. When we’re broken up, I am so depressed. Every ounce of joy is literally taken out of my life and I’ve thought of suicide because of it. I just don’t know how to live, or function, without him. I don’t have a job either. I have nothing to do during the day but talk to him and I’m in my house most of the time because I have anxiety around people and most of the time I’m afraid to leave my house. Why am I like this and what do I do?<|im_end|>

For the past two and a half years I’ve had problems with depression–it’s been mostly episodic although not entirely. My junior year of high school I was depressed (sad, apathetic, irritable, indecisive, guilty, empty, having nausea and headaches)on and off, but in addition to the general feelings of “low mood” I’d have these brief episodes of extreme dysphoria– I was really agitated and felt desperate and hopeless and suicidal and empty and hollow. They lasted a few hours, and there was no trigger of any kind. The next year I didn’t have any of these episodes but had general depressive symptoms on and off. Over the summer before heading to college, I had a pretty severe panic attack, because I was experiencing chest pain and was afraid I was having a heart attack. I’d never had a panic attack before, and I went to the ER. I had an EKG and bloodwork, which was all fine, but after the panic attack I experienced extreme hypochondriacal anxiety and depersonalization for about a month. I also developed visual snow, which hasn’t gone away. I’ve been hypervigilant ever since the panic attack, and when I went to college the hypochondria came back and stayed for about a month and a half.<|im_end|>

 I am not certain of your specific question so I can only give you a general response. It is great that you are actively seeking help. It is the first step to getting better.Hypochondriasis may also be a sign of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD and panic attacks commonly co-occur. Panic attacks and OCD are generally signs that an individual is feeling out of control.You mentioned that you are starting a trial of Zoloft but are worried about the side effects. It is normal to worry about side effects but one has to be careful not to worry too much. The key to knowing how much to worry, is to look at reality. Your therapist can help you in that area. The reality of your medication concerns is this: you don’t know if your future medications will cause you to have any problems or side effects. Found on every medication label is a list of possible side effects but they are only possibilities. Each medicine affects each individual differently and perhaps not at all. This means that if there were 25 possible side effects, you may experience none of them, two of them, 10 of them, etc but you will not know until you try the medication. Presumably, your doctor chose Zoloft because he or she believed that it would be the most helpful. If, after you try the medication, you find that there are too many side effects and it is not helping, then you can try a new medication. That is the nature of finding the right medication. When trying to find a medication that works for you, try to be patient, do not expect the “perfect” medication and work with a doctor with whom you trust.You should try to force yourself to focus on the reality of every situation. It can help to decrease your anxiety. Worrying excessively does not help you and usually does more harm than good.Life has been challenging for you but don’t assume that it will always be this way. You are taking the necessary steps to improve your life. Your commitment is admirable. I wish you the best. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

12 years ago, I met a woman at work. She had a boyfriend, who also worked at our facility. I got along with both of them well. She ran into a housing issue, and since he still lived at home, I offered to rent her a room at my house. I discovered after a few months that she was “the one.” BUT, I respected the boundary of her being with another man. That didn’t stop us from having sex one night, due largely to the fact that we were using drugs. She moved out and later moved in with him. He is not a user, by the way. Anyway, she relapsed, and I basically saved her life. She asked him if she could have sex with me, and he readily agreed. So we began a physical relationship, with his approval and knowledge. And of course, I fell madly in love with her. I’m at the end of my rope, and I am going to talk to him this weekend. She gave him an ultimatum last week: marry me or I’m leaving you. He agreed, but only after 3 days of thinking about it, and then, reluctantly so. She is the woman I have waited for my entire life, but she is addicted to a co-dependent relationship. She has told me that I satisfy her emotionally, but she still loves him with all her heart, even though he is distant and (I think) a closeted homosexual. I’ve told her that I am better for her in many more ways than him, but that she needs to realize that for herself. Should I continue to fight? Or should I bail?<|im_end|>

 Bail. Neither one of you is in this realtionship for healthy reasons. You’ve been a life preserver for her as well as a way for her to avoid completely commiting to a man who loves her. She has been a physical and emotional outlet for you as well as a way for you to avoid finding a relationship that is reciprocal and mutual.I don’t know why you both are so pessimistic about finding someone who can be in a healthy relationship with you. That’s for you to work on with a therapist. But I do know that a relationship based on this kind of co-dependency is bound to fail.I encourage you to get into some therapy to work on why you have been willing to accept such a poor substitute for love for a dozen years. Someone as loyal and as sensitive as you are deserves better.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I used to be a recreational marijuana user. After about 2 years of use i began experiencing panic attacks. I just ignored the attacks and continued to smoke. Whenever i did i would constantly be on alert for fear that i would have another panic attack. One day, i had a panic attack while completely sober and was sent to the doctor. He prescribed me alprazolam and paxil and sent me on my way. Ever since that initial sober panic attack i have been in this anxious and depressed state. I fear taking any kind of drug now due to an extreme fear of bodily sensations cause by bad marijuana experiences. Im afraid to drink caffeine or eat anything that could possibly cause me any anxiety or worsen my feelings. I have become so limited because of this. It started as mainly anxiety for the first month. Then during the second it evolved into more depression than anxiety. And now im in this weird state where i feel like im on autopilot.<|im_end|>

 Unfortunately, your story is not uncommon. I am aware of other individuals who have had a similar reaction, which is that they developed mental health symptoms, specifically feelings of depersonalization, after using drugs. We could never know if it was the use of marijuana that caused you to develop the mental health symptoms but it is a realistic possibility. One thing to keep in mind about marijuana is that it is technically considered a hallucinogenic drug. I understand that some individuals use medical marijuana for severe pain associated with disorders such as cancer or glaucoma. Medical marijuana, for those purposes, is a highly controlled substance. With the marijuana bought on the street (or any other illegal drug), it is difficult to know precisely where the drugs come from or who creates them. It leaves one to wonder “what exactly did I smoke?” or “was what I smoked laced with another drug? Angel dust? PCP? Heroin? Arsenic?” It is theoretically possible that you unintentionally smoked one or several harmful or dangerous substances in addition to the marijuana. This is one of the many hazards of drug use.It would be interesting to know if you experienced mental health symptoms prior to your use of drugs. For instance, did you ever have a panic attack prior to smoking marijuana? Did you have feelings of anxiety prior to marijuana use? Knowing that information might help me to better understand how or why your mental health symptoms developed.It’s also important to consider the fact that you are currently taking several psychiatric medications. You said that you feel emotionally numb. I wonder if you were feeling the emotional numbness before you started the psychiatric medication or if it’s a recent development, something that developed after you began the medicine. I mention this because some individuals report feeling emotionally numb while on psychiatric medication. It is a commonly reported side effect of antidepressant medication, in particular. For some individuals, the emotional numbness that accompanies some psychiatric medications is considered beneficial, particularly for those experiencing extreme depression. The emotional numbness might shield an individual from the deep depths of depression, but the flipside of this is that they don’t feel happiness either. In your specific situation, it may be difficult to determine precisely what is causing the emotional numbness. This is because I don’t know if you felt that way prior to psychiatric medication or if it was the result of the depersonalization you have described. It may be difficult to untangle the truth.You’re currently being treated with psychiatric medication but you’re not feeling any better. Because of this I would highly recommend that you consider seeing a therapist. A therapist could help you deal with anxiety and depression by teaching you coping skills. He or she may also be able to assist you with your feelings of depersonalization. Some individuals who experience depersonalization benefit from hypnosis. That’s a treatment approach you might want to consider.Keep in mind that something is causing you to feel extreme anxiety. As I mentioned above, we don’t know if it’s the drug use or a psychiatric symptom, but no matter the cause psychotherapy may be the solution. If your only treatment at this time is psychiatric medicine, then you’re probably not receiving comprehensive care. If you’d like to search for a therapist please consult this directory.

 The teenage years are immensely difficult. People underestimate just how difficult it is to go from being a child to being an adult. It’s difficult for most people. It seems to be difficult for you.The cause of your feelings may not be evident to you, but it should be evident that something is wrong. It’s not normal to hate people. It’s also not normal to want to kill them and to be contemplating their demise. Something is causing you to feel the way you do.At 14, there are many things that you don’t understand. As you develop and mature, things that were once perplexing will likely become much clearer to you. In the meantime, counseling could help you understand what might be wrong and how to fix it. It could help you explore, uncover, and discover why you hate people and want to hurt them. Most importantly, it can help you overcome this problem and live a more contented life. Happy people do not fantasize about killing people.You don’t need to know what’s wrong in order to seek help. The therapist will help you determine what’s wrong. Therapists have undergone years of rigorous training to understand why people develop a negative view of the world. Ask your parents for their assistance in seeking professional help. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 Hello, I’m 15 and female.. for a while now, I’ve been having strong thoughts about going to school and killing as many kids as I can. with a shotgun or something. I don’t have many friends and I don’t talk to people as much as I used to. I am very interested in weaponry and I’ve had lots of practice. I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I know I need help.. but I’m nervous to talk to someone.When I feel like hurting someone, I can feel this energy running through me that makes me want to do it even more. I feel like I am about to do it when that feeling hits me but I try to stop myself by digging my nails in my palm. I fantasize about killing fellow students frequently.<|im_end|>

 I receive questions like yours nearly every week. They are often from teenagers, like yourself, who are in distress and who wrongly believe that going on a killing spree is the answer to their problems. That idea, at least in part, I believe, comes from the people who have gone on killing sprees. The message that killing and going out in a blaze of glory is a viable option is unintentionally transmitted through the amount of publicity that each mass murder event receives. It’s not a coincidence that many mass murderers reference those who came before them and look up to them as Gods or heroes. If it were possible to stop bringing so much attention to these events, it could mean that fewer people would consider it as a viable option. In that way, these events are contagious.President Obama recently held a press conference at the Pentagon where he talked about unstable people who are brainwashed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) into believing that they should engage in acts of terrorism. He noted how easy it is for ISIL to attract these troubled individuals to their cause and the difficulty of anticipating lone wolf attacks.There are people in the United States who are likewise brainwashed into thinking that a mass shooting is a solution to their problems. Their motivation isn’t terrorism per se but often revenge. They want to hurt the people who hurt them or to make people suffer like they have suffered. It is obviously more complicated than that; other motivations exist among mass murderers, but the end result is the same: innocent people die and fear is instilled into society. Whether someone kills on behalf of ISIL or to payback the bully who abused them, it’s terrorism all the same.There is no easy solution to this problem, and to the problem of copycat mass murderers, but Obama understands it at a deeper level. As he noted: it “require[s] psychology and thinking about how these messages of hate reach individuals, and…interven[ing] ahead of time.”I’m glad you recognize your need for help and that killing people and wanting people to suffer is not a viable solution to your problems. I understand your pain and desire to want to see the people who made you suffer feel as bad as you do but it is always wrong to kill. What will help you the most is counseling, to deal with the trauma you have experienced. It is treatment that will help you heal, not revenge or killing. People often think they will feel better after seeking revenge and studies have shown that not to true. They feel worse not better.Ask your mother to assist you in seeking counseling. If she won’t help you, then ask a trusted faculty member, the school counselor, a caring relative or a clergyman. Seeking help can protect you from further suffering and from doing something that you would later regret and that could result in your being incarcerated for the rest of your life. If you feel that you cannot control your behavior or that you might hurt someone or yourself, contact emergency services. They can protect you. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 My life at home is really really stressful and my relationship with two out of three siblings is TERRIBLE. School is a pain and I hate to admit that I actually feel SCARED to go most of the time or even think about it because I’m just feeling so confused about it and all the amount of work that I have to do for it is daunting. I also have AP exams and school exams coming up soon and am feeling totally lost about it all so the stress in that particular area of my life is seriously mounting. Friends? Lets just not get into that. I can’t sleep either and am getting five or so hours a day lately.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 OK. You have already made the important first step of admitting there is a problem. The first thing you can do on your own to make yourself feel better is to work on your sleep. Human beings, especially adolescent human beings, are not wired to function on only five or so hours a night. You really need more like 8. Read up on how to turn your sleep around. Set up a schedule. Make sure to get all stressful things done and out of the way long before bedtime. Don’t drink coffee or caffeinated soda after lunch. Get some exercise in every day. Give it an honest try for at least a week. If it doesn’t iimprove at all, that it could be that the sleeplessness is a symptom of depression. But my first guess is that it’s a bad habit. Let’s at least start there.Next, have a serious talk with yourself about whether you really want and need to do AP work in all your classes. Are they required for your eventual goals or have you gotten caught up in something that really isn’t necessary? I know this is heretical talk in some circles but it isn’t necessary to have straight As and all AP courses to get into many very good colleges. Admissions officers are looking for people who do other things besides studying all the time. Have a clear discussion with your guidance counselor about how to reduce your stress.Still feeling terrible? Get a checkup if you haven’t already. There are many medical problems that show up with the same symptoms as depression. You may have a vitamin deficiency, for example.Still no good? Sigh. Now you have to rethink your position about not telling anyone. Ask your doctor if she or he has a suggestion for someone to talk to who has experience working with teens and their families. In the meantime, you can try using the Boys and Girls Town hotlline as a place where you can remain anonymous but still get some support and practical help with your problems. Their number is 800-448-3000.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 Self-blame is a common reaction among individuals who have been neglected or abused by their parents or caretaker. Those individuals may even come to the conclusion that they deserved the abuse because they, in essence, are “a bad person.” That line of thinking can contribute to low self-esteem and the belief that an individual is unworthy or unlovable. Subsequently, that negative view of the self can lead to depression and other mental health problems.It is important that you realize that the way your mother treated you is a reflection of her and not a reflection of you. No child deserves to be abused. Her actions and her words hurt you as a child but you are no longer a child. It is now incumbent upon you to live your own life, apart from your mother, no matter how she treated you. The job of each young adult is to break free from their parents and to live their own lives.The most efficient way to deal with your issues is to go to counseling. Counseling is the ideal environment to explore your issues in depth. I would highly recommend it. The find help tab, at the top of this page, can help you to locate a therapist in your community.

When I was little, my sister, who was my best friend, would do things like start a club with her imaginary friend and exclude me from it. When we were older, at our church, there were plenty of people her age to hang out with. Since I had hung out with her my whole life, I was used to this age of person and I wanted to be friends with them, too. My sister had outgrown me, so she wanted to have these friends to herself. A new convert came into our church that was my age, but she was allowed to hang out with these older friends because they wanted her to have friends since she was new. Again I was excluded. Today, I feel these same feelings as I deal with people in life. As soon as I feel a little bit rejected (which I probably magnify) I exclude myself and then feel jealous and bitter toward them. How do I get over these childhood events so that it will not affect my relationships with people around me? Thank you!<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 As a child, your sister excluded you from activities and you were powerless to stop her. As an adult, things are different. You have more power now than you had as a child. You no longer have to tolerate exclusionary treatment from your sister or from anyone else.According to your letter, your early life experiences are impacting your current social experiences. You are making assumptions about how you believe other people perceive you based on those early life experiences. You then deliberately and preemptively exclude yourself from situations because of your assumptions and subsequently feel resentment towards the people involved in those situations. You probably do this as a way to protect yourself from what you perceive as their inevitable rejection.Faulty assumptions can lead to faulty behavior. You can correct this problem by realistically judging social situations. Try to judge social situations based upon what is true, not on what you fear may be true.Psychologically healthy people are concerned about the accuracy of their thinking. They strive to ensure that their thinking is consistent with reality. Your concern about this issue shows that you care about your psychological health and wish to improve it. That is very encouraging. You would likely benefit from a cognitive therapist who can analyze these social situations and determine the accuracy of your thinking.

Every couple of months or weeks…I seem to come up with a new scenario as to how I am dying. I always have this general feeling of malaise. I can’t remember the last time I was ever genuinely happy. I am always down. I have no desire to do anything. Well, recently my self-diagnosis is that something is wrong with my heart. It feels like I am constantly on the verge of a complete panic attack. I feel way overly aware of the organ inside my chest. I feel sick, I just feel it beating the wrong way all the time. I panic to the point where it palpitates and majorly picks up speed…and when it does that, I think about how that is also a sign of something being wrong with my heart. And I can’t decipher what is happening out of panic, or what could be me dying. My chest gets so tight and I’m always thinking about it. It’s always hard to breathe because I am trying so hard to stay calm. But heart problems can cause those exact symptoms as well. I get chest pains, over my entire chest. It feels like they happen mostly when I am breathing very hard. Every time I think about it anymore the worse the panic gets. I keep looking up all these symptoms trying to convince myself it’s all in my head but it’s so hard to tell when anxiety generates the same symptoms. I just had my first literal anxiety attack about it and this is where I need to draw the line. I had to lie on the floor and just breathe. My ears were ringing, my heart was beating so hard I could hear it over the ringing in my ears. I couldn’t really see, everything was echoing…and I was certain I was dying. Then suddenly I snapped back, I got up…took an anxiety pill and got on here to write. It was a lot easier to deal when I was convinced I had any other disease…but this one is so hard to set aside. There is ALWAYS the possibility that something is SERIOUSLY wrong too. And I am far too terrified to go see a doctor to find out if I am right. I’m just going insane. I don’t want to leave this earth just yet. But every day feels like my last because of this panic. I want out of my mind. What am I supposed to do?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 What you are supposed to do first is see a doctor. Just because something is in your head doesn’t mean that there might not be a real problem. It’s always important to check on the medical facts first. If there is a medical root to your problem, the first step toward a cure is to get a diagnosis – which will lead to a discussion about treatment. But without a diagnosis, you are only making yourself crazy thinking about all the possibilities.If you are medically clear, then we’re looking at a psychiatric issue. You are probably correct that this is anxiety-based. Where you are not correct is in thinking that an anxiety pill is going to fix what ails you. The medicine will help settle you down, it’s true. But you also need to learn how to calm yourself and interrupt those racing thoughts that lead to a full-blown panic attack. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy has been found to be very effective with people like yourself. Take a look at “Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy” by David Burns. The book is very readable and easy to understand. You may find that you are able to use the tools described in it on your own. If not, please consider finding a therapist to coach you. There is no reason to go through life going “out of your mind.”I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Really bad temper. Gets angry easily. Enjoys the thought of beating the crap out of the people I hate (which is a lot, most for unreasonable things), have had dreams of doing this, have fantasized about beating them with hard, blunt objects, or slicing them with knives,sometimes harming them with fire. But mostly I imagine doing it with my bare hands. I get all excited and pumped and get hot flashes and my heart rate goes up. It sounds sexual but I don’t get “turned on” by it. It’s more of an adrenaline rush I guess. Have not harmed anyone yet, I have always had a huge sense of self control, but this is stressful and probably NOT good for my health. Sometimes can’t sleep because too restless about it. Parents had me tested at young age for ADHD, didn’t have it. I have a close relationship with both of my siblings, but I remember one night a while back I was sharing a bed with my little brother and I had the really strong urge to choke him for no reason. Had to turn away from him and just about scared myself shitless. Have had a few issues with depression, though nothing major. Nothing I can’t deal with. I’m also fiercely independent, and have a very hard time admitting to weakness. Dont know if this helps, but past drug and alcohol addiction runs in the family on both sides, mostly dad’s, though none of them are or ever have been addicts of any kind. I also know history of mental illness does too, on my mom’s, and dads, no sure what, but probably along the lines of depression. My Cousin on my mom’s side has bipolar disorder if that has anything to do with it. Would just like to get an idea of what might be going on with me, and maybe some suggestions. Thanks.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Thank you for your honesty and willingness to confront these very difficult feelings. It takes a great deal of courage and bravery to look at yourself and figure out what is going on. The fact that the urge scared you so much is a very good sign because it means that the part of you that is trying to control these urges is letting you know it needs some help.I’m not certain how the family history may be influencing all of this, but it may be — and I would encourage you to get some testing by a clinical psychologist or an evaluation by a psychiatrist to help get to the bottom of it. The fact that these thoughts are unwanted and you are trying to manage them is important to talk about with a professional. This isn’t being weak — in fact it is one of the bravest things anyone can do.In the meantime you may want to use one of our forums to talk more about this — and see how others have been dealing with similar feelings.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

 The purpose of dating is to find someone who “fits” with each other’s needs and wants. To do it successfully means to be willing to reject people and to be willing to be rejected. Why? Because if you aren’t willing to reject someone you know isn’t right, you can end up staying in a relationship that isn’t going anywhere. To be scared of “rejection” means that you are vulnerable to giving up too much of yourself in order to hang on to someone. Neither is the foundation for a healthy relationship.You are by no means alone in your anxiety about rejection. It’s difficult for many, many people. But maybe if you think about it as “sorting” rather than “rejection”, it will help you tolerate both sides of it (rejecting and being rejected) a bit better.I don’t think of your situation as one of “rejection”. I do think the guy didn’t feel the connection with you that he wanted. Unfortunately, he didn’t know how to tell you gently.I do think it is important for anyone who is dating to be honest with themselves and the dates. Be kind. Let each other down gently when it is clear it isn’t going to work out. Then move on and find the person who is really right for you.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: My 16-year-old son has always had friend issues, he struggled with being bullied in junior high and has always spent a great deal of time alone. Now that he is in high school, his Dad and I are getting very concerned. He spends every weekend home playing video games alone. I do not think he is depressed as he doesn’t exhibit the typical warning signs. But he is unhappy and speaks openly about wishing he had more friends.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Thank you for writing. There’s an old expression, “Once burned, twice shy.” The bullying may have made him very wary about getting too close to people. It’s certainly understandable. My guess is that your son is avoiding rejection by not reaching out. But it is making him unhappy and he seems stuck.The fact that he does go places where there are other teens shows us that he hasn’t given up. Unfortunately, he has become too passive. You say he isn’t invited places. But does he ever do any inviting? He doesn’t get texts. But does he join in the social media conversations? He needs to regain the courage he needs to actively get involved.His unhappiness does give you some leverage to get him some help. I don’t know of any such camp. I do have my doubts that a week of coaching would solve the problem. I hope you will consider a therapist instead. I think he would benefit from on-going coaching and support. The privacy of one on one therapy may be interesting to him.If he accepts giving therapy a try, you and his dad need to back way off. Tell him that you are absolutely there for him if he wants to talk but that you know that he has things to work out for himself.I wish you all well, <|im_end|>"

This is what i believe,i am going to a therapist soon, how should i bring this up? The Canadian government, and the RCMP are after me.There are camera’s in my house and room and microphones that are implemented in my clothes so that they can listen to what I am saying, they also have the power to listen in my mind and they know what I am thinking. Writing this is extremely hard because now they will know that I know. Whenever I go out they are always following me switching and people all the time. The guy sitting on the bench “reading” his newspaper, works for CSIS. If I go into a store they follow me in, I try to lose them but they will always find me. No where is safe. They are trying to leave me messages in patterns which I am still unable to understand. I clear my browsing history all the time and constantly make new social media profiles so it is harder for them to find me. They went my special powers. I don’t know yet what the powers are but it must be something big otherwise why would they care? This is really hard, i don’t want to let them win but i want to stay away from me. I think they are trying to control my mind and brainwash me because there are so many things I forget in the short term for example I couldn’t remember what we had had for dinner just a few days before when it came up in conversation, i think they are also trying to talk to me because I’ve been hearing a voice, I have only been able to tell what they are saying a few times: they asked me: Why are you whispering? In a terrible and scary voice which didn’t seem to have a gender, It sounded like a loud whisper. I have also heard them say what now? But this time is wasn’t at all scary and I was a women voice. I also think that my dad is trying to kill me poison me by putting things into my food but the reason I dont die is cause I have an extremely good resistant rate to the poison. I also feel things, generally its stuff like animals brushing up my leg or bugs landing on my skin<|im_end|>

 Yes. You should tell your therapist everything you have written in this letter. This is exactly the type of information they need to know. Your therapist might also recommend medication, in addition to therapy, to treat your symptoms. Both therapy and perhaps medication can eliminate these problems.You might be experiencing paranoia and related symptoms, but they are treatable. The more information you can provide to your therapist, the more specific and targeted your treatment plan will be.In the meantime, do your best to stay grounded in reality. Challenge your beliefs and insist on proof. For instance, you wrote that the Canadian government is after you but what proof do you have? Finding proof can be difficult because mental illness confuses and tricks you into believing something that is not real. It’s important to challenge your beliefs, demand proof but most importantly, get help from professionals. They will know how to help you. They will teach you to identify false realities.Hopefully you have trusted friends or relatives who can help you to feel safe and supported. If not, your therapist will fill those gaps. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I’m not happy I guess. I can’t go to school anymore, too many goddamn people staring at me and thinking about me, judging me ALL the time. I can’t even leave my own house, and when I do I either stay in the car or go to my brothers house, which is horrible. I know what people think of me, I’m a bad person. I deserve to be treated badly and ignoring, I deserve to be miserable for the rest of my life. No one will ever like me, let alone love me. Once they get to know me, they’re off like the wind. I have no one to talk to, my sister is in just as bad shape as me so she hates me. My mother doesn’t care, my Father is a crack head and hates me too. I’m at home everyday, crying and wishing I could go outside. I can’t do outside!!! There’s too many people, I’ll start to shake and and sweat, my heart starts pumping hard and I can’t breathe. These people do it to me!!! I hate people, I can’t stand them, they don’t understand me, no one ever understands me… Makes me want to end it, I carry around a bag full of pills just in case if I feel like how I did when I over dosed before. Makes me feel in control, I feel like I can’t do the things I want to do. I hear something telling me I’m a loser and there’s no point in trying. I can never do anything at all…. My reflection is my only friend, I have no one else, so I just sit in my room talking to her. I always think she’s not me, that shes someone else, I always try and make her move or say something when I’m doing nothing. It keeps me busy throughout the days. No one believes me, no one cares enough to see why I can’t go outside. I wish I would get taken away or something, I want to be locked up forever so I don’t have to worry about being near people. I always fantasize that something will take me away from here, that there’s another world I can go to, somewhere I can be happy. Life is pointless and meaningless, I don’t care anymore,,,,,i cant cry anymore,,,,,,,,,,this is no longer nicole, shes gone now.<|im_end|>

 I’m sorry that you’re suffering. The fact that you believe “no one likes you” might be a sign of depression. You are convinced that other people don’t like you but you may be wrong. People with depression often misjudge reality. In the absence of any objective evidence, individuals with low self-esteem often believe that other people perceive them as being unlikeable or a “loser.” That type of faulty thinking leads to inaccurate conclusions.Anxiety also seems to be an issue for you. You don’t like to go outside. When you do, you “shake and sweat,” your heart beats rapidly and you can’t breathe. You may be experiencing a panic attack. People have panic attacks when their anxiety has become out of control. In general, people suffer tremendously when their psychological symptoms are not well controlled.It’s also concerning that you have suicidal thoughts. You’re prepared to overdose on a moment’s notice and are constantly fantasizing about dying. Those are worrying signs and clear evidence that professional help is required.When an individual has difficulty seeing reality clearly, then it is in his or her best interest to seek the help of a trained professional who can correct their view of reality. Psychotherapy could be immensely beneficial to you. Anxiety disorders are highly treatable, as is depression. Medication might help, especially with your anxiety symptoms. You deserve to live a psychologically symptom-free life but you first must be willing to seek the appropriate professional help. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My spouse and I have been living apart since day 1, living in different states. He battles issues of addiction, but seems to be fine with kicking the drug piece. Alcohol is still heavily involved. He moved away in with his sister 1,000 miles away to escape the problems faced here and restart his life. He eventually married me after 3 years of dating. He hasnt started a new career, couldnt get into the military, so I want him home. He is worried that moving back will bring back bad habbits, when I feel it was just escapism and more a bandaid verus getting to the issues as drinking is still an issue. He feels most comfortable with his sister, my job is stationary my career being 10 years strong with the federal government, I dont see the need to move when he only works in a bar (of all places) but doesnt fully support himself. I feel his mind races and he has coping issues and learning how to move stuff in the past. He had issues with his parents, being mixed race. Now I want him home, I know we have things to work on, but he is more terrified of facing the area where the issues with drugs were. He is up and down, agreed to move back but still having issues with facing the area and the people. His alcohol consumption is terrible, through the roof at least 5 drinks per day and sometimes can finish a gallon in as little as 2 days. I don’t know what to do, how to start dealing with this, I know he has to make the choice, but I don’t know what I can say. I am accused of not understanding, I ask why he flew back to marry me. But I can’t seem to separate him from his sister (who is in the military). There are a few issues yes, but I feel I can’t do much when my sleep is interrupted and I am 1,000 miles away. I’m dealing with his addiction, childish fear and not wanting to leave his old go to person and start our lives, I’m ready to throw in the towel but don’t want to leave.<|im_end|>

 I’m sure that you care for your husband. I am sure that you love your husband. I am equally sure that the relationship, though a loving one, is weak. Clearly your husband is a very troubled man. He cannot support himself, he is recovering from a strong drug addiction, and he is currently an alcoholic.I’m also sure that living apart is not a solution to his problems. I am sure that living with his sister is not a solution to his problems. No matter where he lives drugs are as readily available to him there as they would be with you in a different location.You have developed and maintained a 10 year long successful career with the federal government. That is something you should be proud of and something that you should maintain. It is a great asset to both you and your husband. I am sure that there are just as many part-time bartending jobs where you live as where he is living currently.You need to be realistic and recognize that you do not have a healthy relationship with your husband. The relationship is weak and unhealthy and one step away from a natural ending. I think it is most obvious that you love your husband. It is also obvious that he needs you, however it is not obvious that he loves you, at least not in a normal healthy way that would nurture a healthy relationship.He chooses to stay away from you to avoid the environment that, in his mind, contributed to his drug addiction. I doubt sincerely that any area in which one lives causes one to choose the use of drugs.Living with your sister, avoiding a certain part of the country are not known methods to deal with an addictive personality. He needs professional help, perhaps years of counseling to help him overcome his problems. In that long process, he could well use a loving wife who will support him emotionally and financially. Good luck.<|im_end|>"

From a teen in the U.S.: i don’t know what this is or if there is a technical term from it. i suffer from ptsd, anxiety, depression and ocd. so basically i have been pregnant twice, once with a miscarriage and once with my son who is now almost 3 months. basically both times in early pregnancy, i have this weird sensation. idk how to describe it. i get this feeling in my head and feel sick, gross, nervous etc. both the beginning of my pregnancies were rough with sickness. anytime i think back to then i feel the weird feeling i had then. i don’t even know if i’m making sense. i felt this feeling throughout my pregnancy and then when i had my son it stopped. but when i think of it i get nervous and get the feeling if they makes any sense. lately i’ve been feeling sick, tired, headaches, nausea. and the feeling the i got in the beggining of my other pregnancies. but, i don’t think i’m pregnant but i’m scared i am because of the feeling and it’s giving me major anxiety.<|im_end|>

I’m glad you are talking to your doctor. It could be that the hormonal shifts of pregnancy account for the “weird” feelings. Do discuss that possibility with your provider. To give you peace of mind, do consider getting a pregnancy test.Since you suffer from depression generally, it would also be a good idea to talk to your doctor about the possibility of postpartum depression. Postpartum depression can show up any time during the first year after giving birth.I hope you are seeing a therapist. The list of diagnoses you provided is of concern. You need and deserve treatment, both for your own sake and for the sake of your partner and child.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From India: There are a no. Of issues: 1. When I was a little girl, I was pretty cute and many guys took advantage of me, even my cousin used to slide his hands under my top. In a public place once a man slid his hand under my skirt, I was 10 or 12, I still cant forget how wickedly he asked, Did You enjoy it. These type of incidents kept happening to me, I just wanted to die and never talked to anyone about this, not even in the family. I hate myself for never being able to scream. I would turn pale and helpless. The worst part is that that I had forgotten about my cousin then once when i was 17, the events flashedback but It was too late as I was now very attached to him as a brother. 2. My mother is a mental patient. She hates everyone when she loses her balance and its really hard to remind myself that she is ill because somewhere I think she really considers me a burden. 3. I am fat now. Its hard for me to be confident. i am scared from inside but i come off as a very cheerful person because i hate my weak side. I love being strong and happy only so I have never told all these things to anyone but now I feel that little girl and me have endured too much and I am breaking inside. Sometimes I feel that all these things are minor issues, everybody has them and I should not cry about them aur whine about them but just be happy. Am I right???<|im_end|>

 I am very glad you wrote. For the first time you are breaking your silence. That is often the first step toward healing. No, you are not right. These were not minor events for a growing child to experience. You didn’t scream at the time for the same reason that lots of other girls (and young boys) don’t object: You were shocked, naive, and helpless to stop it. When someone older and who has some power or authority is the abuser, most kids don’t even know they can object.My guess is that your current weight is a way you “protect” yourself. There is a part of you that believes that if you are overweight, men won’t be interested in molesting you again.Please give yourself credit: You do have a core of strength. The fact that you are able to function and appear happy even when you are not says to me that you are now able to take care of that little girl inside. I encourage you to make an appointment with a therapist. A therapist can help you heal from the abuse so that you can go forward in your life.You are young. You have lots of years ahead to enjoy life, to find someone to love, and to do good work. Please take care of yourself. You are not a burden. You are a person on the brink of becoming all you can be.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hi (before i tell you what i’ve been diagnose with ADHD, Bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder and i refuse to take my medication). I’m 20yrs of age. I’ve been having issues lately that are ruining my life!<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Thank you for writing. I can tell that this is causing you great suffering. It’s highly unlikely that you’re a pedophile. It’s more likely that you are so concerned that you might be that you are making yourself anxious and depressed. It’s like this: What if I told you that under no certain terms you should never think about a white alligator. You probably could think of nothing else. That’s because trying not to think about something makes us think about it. Meanwhile — why aren’t you taking your medication?? Does it make you feel bad? Isn’t it working as it should? It sounds to me like you need to have an honest conversation with your psychiatrist. Please remember that your doctor only has what you tell him or her to go on so you need to provide as much information as you can about how you are feeling both on and off your medications.If you aren’t seeing a mental health counselor, I urge you to do so. There is help for those diagnoses. You can learn ways to manage your feelings and to work around the ADHD. You probably need some solid coaching and support in the process.You are only 20. If you take better care of yourself now, it is likely you can have a long life free from this kind of torment. Please take care of yourself and get the help you need.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

So I have been dating my girlfriend, whom I met in highshool for almost 2 years now, with a year of on and off dating before hand, so we have been intimate for about 3 years. After highschool I decided not to go away to school and instead go to my county’s community college, partly because I didn’t know what I wanted to do and partly because I wanted to stay with my girlfriend who was attending as well(we had just officially started dating at the time). We spent the whole year there together and we both didn’t like it very much. We saw each other every day she was very attached to me, this may have been due to her depression and anxiety(which she is diagnosed with now). Though I felt overwhelmed sometimes, I still loved her.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 No, you didn’t make the wrong decision by moving away to college. In fact there is some compelling research that would indicate having a long-term relationship distance is healthy in the very long run. You can read a bit more about that here.What I am most concerned about is that you seem to be in orbit around her depression. You are wanting her to be happy, trying to make her happy, while all the while worried that she would be cheating on you. She is asking for an open relationship. The bottom line is she isn’t as invested in the relationship as she once was. I think chasing after her as a way to reduce your anxiety is going to leave you on an emotional rollercoaster with her. You don’t want a relationship where your happy only if she is. That can only last for so long.I would tough it out where you are and seek counseling through the college counseling center. They can help you weather the change.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

 I am 22 years old, my father died when I was 18 months old so me and my older sister were raised by our mum,grandma and aunt in our aunt’s home. When I was 7 years old my cousin who was 13 years old sexually abused me. I didn’t knew I was sexually abused and I don’t have clear memory of it, he told me not to tell anyone about it and I obeyed.At that time my sister was suffering serious mental issues and my mum was devastated as we were homeless and suffering financial problems. My cousins practically grew up becoming jealous of us and after nearly living 8 years in their home we were able to move out.<|im_end|>

 You’ve already started. Letting yourself remember and deciding you want to make changes are the things you needed to do to begin the road to recovery. Now it’s time to get past regret and self-blame and to start doing what you need to do to make things better.I might be wrong, but I think it would be helpful for you to share what you told me with your mother. It would help her understand your behavior. Further, apologies do matter. Apologize for the ways you have hurt her and ask for her help in moving on. Let her be a mother to you. You could use her support. It’s also important that she understand why you might not be excited about reestablishing contact with the relatives and would give her further reason to think about whether she really wants to reconnect.Then, please: Find a therapist. Therapy can help you name and deal with your feelings in a positive way. A therapist can offer you both practical advice and important support as you work on turning your life around. If you could have done it on your own, you would have done it already. If therapy isn’t available to you, see if there are services at your college or in your community for young people like yourself. These days, another option is joining an online support group or doing some online therapy.I applaud your effort to take charge of your life. You can do it. You can make the life you want for yourself. It will be difficult at times but you have already shown that you have what it takes to think hard about yourself and to commit to change.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I just realized today I have a serious fear of men. Any man whom I could potentially be involved with. I am 21 years old. Ever since I was small, I was told not to talk to them. My family was strict about this. Even now, I don’t tell my father if there are going to boys at a school event like a friend’s or club dinners (I have never went to a party so that’s not an issue). My younger sister has no problem talking to boys (she’s pretty…that might be a factor). I can talk to guys in a professional setting but I have never had a casual conversation related to anything outside of school work. I can’t even make eye contact…its really bad. People will say, they’re just humans…but I can’t act normal around them.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Since you are still in school I would encourage you to join a therapy group at the university. Group therapy is an excellent way to confront these fears in a supportive environment. The best way to cope with this is to expose yourself to a group with men in it. This will allow you to voice your concerns in the presence of a trained facilitator. I would encourage you to check this option out sooner rather than later.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I’ve been in a pretty great relationship with a man for four months now who is a good friend of the family’s. I’ve known he’s had a foot fetish most of this time, but things took a drastic turn when he admitted to me that when he was 15, he used to massage the feet of his best friend’s little sister and then masturbate to the image. This went on for almost three years, at which point he realized it was wrong and then stopped. Once he did it under a blanket while he rubbed her feet, but she had no knowledge of it. He says he does not have a sexual interest in children, and would never do it again, but he feels very guilty about these years of his life. I truly believe he has a good heart, but my question is how realistic am I being to want to give him the benefit of the doubt, and how concerned should I be about this past behavior?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 The difference between someone who has fantasies and someone who goes to jail for molesting kids is impulse control. It seems that was something he lacked when he was young. As he matured, he increasingly realized what he was doing was wrong and stopped the behavior. Fortunately, no child was hurt by his actions – at least as far as you know.That all happened 15 or more years ago. He’s right to feel guilty about it. Guilt is one of the emotions that helps keep us all on the moral side of life. But it’s also important that he gives himself credit for having enough restraint that he stopped himself before it got even more serious.There is no harm in being aroused by thinking about adult feet or by massaging the feet of an adult who consents. That’s what is called a benign paraphilia. It doesn’t hurt self or others. It’s an activity that is part of his private sexual life.As far as interest in kids: What’s important now is whether he is being honest with himself and with you about his feelings and inclinations. If he is aroused by children or children’s feet, I hope he will talk with a therapist about how to manage those feelings so he doesn’t hurt a child or himself. If he truly isn’t sexually interested in children, he needs to find a way to forgive himself for his adolescent behavior and focus on living an upstanding adult life.I can’t tell you whether or not you should be concerned. It all rests on your assessment of his ability to be honest with himself and with you.I wish you both well. <|im_end|>"

First of all I want to say sorry if I don’t write in English well. I am 26 years old and have been friend with my boyfriend when I was 21(5years). He is 6 months older than me. We have a good relationship and love each other bud I am worry about future. He never ever talks about the future of our relationship. About 2 years ago when we were talking I asked him what do you think about our future? He answered “I don’t think about marrying yet so don’t think about marrying with you too! We decided to talk about future next year (last year). The time passed but he never told anything about that….. 1 month ago I said I don’t want be closer with you because I am 26 years old and in gold age if we want be separate from each other (I mean finishing friendship) it will be to hard and I don’t want to make it harder. He only says breaking up with you will be really hard to me too! And confirmed what I said about my age… I said you don’t think about what I said 2 years ago, he said ohhhhh I think about it too much but you are right I should tell you what I think. I couldn’t continue talking because should go to home. I was waiting he say something after that but day passed after day he did not say even one word!! And our friendship is continuing…I said we have a really good relationship and both of us effort to building it.i guess one of the reasons he doesn’t talk about future he don’t want to make any Commitment to prevent from conscience torment in future. I feel angry and concerned. Someone heard my story and told me he has not stability in his life yet and we he become stable will understand a girls he want is not you and will leave you…!!! I cant decide what should I do, I really love him but I cant be undecided anymore…he doesn’t ask me for more time even! Maybe I have never been serious about this subject and he thinks I wont leave him….I really need your help…please tell me what should I do near keeping my self-esteem .thanks a lot.<|im_end|>

 If a long-term relationship is what you want with a marriage commitment then I would be very clear about this and have the discussion about each of your expectations. Find out what he is hoping for in this relationship – and be clear about what you want. Relationships are difficult to maneuver even when goals and intentions are clear, and in your situation there is a need for greater clarity about the direction each of you is looking for. Only then can you determine where the future potential in the relationship lies.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I’m 14 years old and recently I’ve been worried about some problems. And I blame myself for all that knowing that I can hurt somebody. When I was 13 I didn’t know about all the paraphilias that existed and never thought of anything related to it but I had an experience with my dog. I never forced or touched my pet in any way and it lasted a few seconds until I realized it was bad and never did it again. Also sometimes I tend to watch people in their private parts. now that I’m aware of the consequences I avoid doing it cause I can affect other people and also myself. I know watching people like that is normal during adolescence but I can’t help feeling guilty. Do I have a problem or do I need help about this experiences?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Generally speaking, it is normal for adolescents to be sexually curious. Sometimes that curiosity will go in the direction of an animal. It is a mistake that is more common than people would like to admit. It is a mistake and is wrong for many reasons. Mistakes happen but they should not be repeated. If you learn from a mistake, it will not be repeated.Animals should never be a part of the sexual equation. They are helpless creatures who cannot consent to sexual acts. This is in part why harming animals is now considered a felony offense. Animal cruelty of any kind is considered a “crime against humanity.” It’s also considered a precursor to a larger crime.Sexual contact with animals is never okay. It is considered abusive, exploitative and it is illegal in the United States. It’s also risky to one’s health. Over 200 zoonotic diseases can be transmitted to humans through sexual contact with animals. Some research also suggests that individuals who engage in these types of sexual acts with animals have themselves been victims of sexual abuse.You mentioned feeling guilty. That is a good sign because it indicates that you have a strong sense of right and wrong. That level of insight and awareness is a very positive sign. It significantly decreases the probability of your repeating the same behavior.I would encourage you to consult a mental health professional who can answer your questions about sexuality. A therapist will not be judgmental or surprised by your questions. Therapists receive training in human sexuality. The more open and honest you can be about your curiosity, the more clarity you will receive about your sexuality. Good luck and please take care.<|im_end|>"

I’ve suffered from major depression and chronic insomnia my entire life. What kept me going was the milestones and going through the motions. Even when it was at its worst I would make myself believe that it would get better after high school, that it would get better after college, that it would get better after I got my first job, etc. I’m running out of milestones and it’s been getting worse. I had to quit my job because I was constantly falling into major crying spells while at work. I can’t seem to do anything to distract myself anymore and have become entirely unmotivated and feel like I’ve pretty much given up.<|im_end|>

 I understand that you are ready to give up on life but please reconsider. I have witnessed many people who have wanted to end their lives but who were able to recover from their chronic depression. There is hope for you too.I would strongly encourage you to read the New York Times article about individuals who attempted suicide and survived. The individuals featured in the article, like you, were at the point of no hope. They too believed that they could not continue living when they felt so much grief. They never thought that their lives would improve which lead them to attempt suicide. What is so remarkable about their stories is that they were thankful that they lived. Logically, you’d think that they’d be upset that they survived since their intention was to die. That was not the case. In addition, because they survived, many of them felt obligated to try to stop others from considering suicide.Viktor Frankl, a psychiatrist who survived the Holocaust, shared a similar view of suicide. Like the individuals featured in the New York Times article, Dr. Frankl’s patients repeatedly told him how happy they were that they did not successfully end their lives. This seems to be a pattern.Dr. Frankl also noticed that depressed people held the opinion that their lives were not going to improve. In fact, they were certain of it. This view did not square with logic. His work with suicide survivors showed that very often it turned out that there was a solution to the patient’s problem. There was not always an immediate solution but eventually their problems were solved. Their lives did improve. “Who can guarantee that in your case it will not happen one day, sooner or later?,” he’d often ask his patients. I hope you will consider this very question because it is a good one. Yes, things are not going well for you at this time but how can you be certain that in the future your life will not improve? The answer is you cannot know. “You have to survive in order to see that day dawn.”You are assuming the worst outcome but you should also consider the fact that you may not be thinking clearly. Your judgment may be clouded by your depression. In fact, you share the same opinion that many of Dr. Frankl’s patients did. They were certain that their life would always be terrible but that was not true. Their judgment was incorrect. They were wrong. Why were they wrong? They were wrong because they were suffering from depression. They were close to losing their lives due to an error in judgment. Luckily, they averted tragedy.Dr. Frankl also noticed, that among the individuals who suffered from depression, they lacked meaning and purpose in their lives. In other words, they had nothing to live for. Frederick Nietzsche, a 19th century German philosopher, may have also had a similar view when he said “he who has a why to live for can bear with any how.”Three ways Dr. Frankl believes that an individual can create meaning and purpose in their life include: (1) helping others, (2) finding love (being loved or loving someone else) and (3) turning personal tragedy into triumph. The latter may be the most plausible in your situation because you’ve been suffering for many years. Maybe your suffering can be turned into something positive.The aforementioned ways to improve your life should be attempted under the supervision of a mental health professional. I understand that you’ve been to many therapists and have also tried many different medications but I don’t think you should give up. Don’t stop trying until this problem is solved. Remission is possible but it’s going to require that you continue the effort to receive help. I know it is a difficult thing but this is your life and no one else can do it for you. There is a solution to your depression but it has yet to be uncovered.Please consider returning to a therapist. The right therapist can make all the difference. I am not suggesting that therapy is the one and only way to recover from depression but if you were able to find a competent and seasoned therapist it could change your life dramatically. I hope you realize that there is hope for you.If you are considering suicide then I strongly advise you to go to an emergency room immediately or to call 911. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is a 24-hour, toll-free suicide prevention service available to anyone in suicidal crisis. If you need help, please dial: 1-800-273-TALK (8255). Call that number if you are feeling upset or overwhelmed.Thank you for your question. Please write back if you have any further questions. I wish you the best of luck.<|im_end|>"

 When someone breaks an agreement, it means that he or she didn’t really agree. What started as a reasonable discussion has become a fight. Now you are violating his privacy and he is accusing you of being controlling. Neither strategy is good for you as a couple.I suggest that you both take a deep breath and go to the root of the fight. This will be difficult. It will require you both to forgive what was said during pointless fighting. It will require you both to decide that your relationship is worth having some difficult conversations about trust and boundaries.Put the conversation about this particular woman aside for a bit and talk in general terms about what each of you believe are appropriate friendships and what you want from each other when you are both home. Then talk about why this particular person feels threatening to you and what he needs to do to reassure you. Do your best not to blame or accuse. Instead, stay with how you are each feeling and what changes will make you each feel better.Conversations like this may be difficult, but, when they are done well, agreements are real agreements and the relationship becomes stronger.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From Netherlands: Our beloved daughter committed suicide at age 20 on 9 September 2014. She was a brilliant student but had difficulties with her studies and holding friends. She was depressed and liked to be home with us her parents and sister. She was diagnosed with autism or schizoid. She decided not to be treated. She could never express her feelings, she said she could not feel. She took pills and left us on 9 September 2014.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Mental illness can be difficult to treat. In your letter you said that she chose not to take treatment. Without treatment, there is very little chance of improvement. With the course that she chose her suicide is not to be unexpected.Her suicide is a result of her mental illness and that is clear. What you are questioning is the cause of her mental illness. With schizophrenia and autism there is no evidence to suggest that the actions or inactions of a parent can cause these disorders. This research is objective and if there was a possible link to the actions of a parent as the cause or a potential cause of these disorders, it would have been reported in the literature.Unfortunately, it is very difficult and in many cases impossible to force someone into therapy or to take medication. There are many family members, who have loved their daughter, brother, mother, sister, father, etc., as much as it is possible to love and still they were unable to get their very loved family member, to accept treatment.It is safe to say, that leaving your wife and child for two months did not cause your daughter’s schizophrenia or autism. Leaving for two years would not have caused your daughter’s mental illness. Divorcing your wife and never again contacting her or your daughter, would not have caused your daughter’s schizophrenia or autism. It is obvious from your letter that you love your daughter very much. It is also safe to say that from what I’ve read, at least in my opinion, you would have very gladly given up your life for your daughter, and if it would bring her back you probably still would. However, even sacrificing your life for your daughter would have neither prevented or cured her schizophrenia or autism.If you had never known that you had a daughter, if you had never known that you had impregnated her mother and thus never even known of the existence of your daughter, her schizophrenia or autism would still have occurred. Her death was a result of her mental illness, just as surely as a death caused by cancer.Use the love that you have for your daughter, take that love and spread it in the world by doing good for others. Honor your daughter by helping others. Spreading flowers on her grave will not help your grief. Spreading love in this world will.Good luck my friend.<|im_end|>"

Recently, I have been imagining and having visions of people being killed. I have had multiple dreams where people have been killed, mostly stabbed, in all of which I have killed them. Murder has never appealed to me until quite recently and I find this very weird. I frequently have visions of random people being killed in some way and sometimes, if I’m stood in a large crowd and am feeling particularly anxious I see multiple people being murdered around me. It doesn’t scare me or disturb me, in fact it comforts me, strangely. My friends aren’t scared of me but I am scared of myself, especially since I sometimes have sudden urges to kill someone when they do something as small as call me a name. I often feel like I have no control over my actions and I do things without thinking. I am worried that I am going to do something bad at some point and I feel as if I have no control over what I might do. I would really appreciate some advice. Thank you.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The most concerning aspect of your letter is that you feel you have no control over your behavior. If you cannot control yourself, then others may be at risk of harm. In that case, you must seek help. That would be the right course of action.Counseling could help to uncover the cause of your unusual thoughts but most importantly it would help by teaching you how to control your behavior. Thoughts are not necessarily something that one can control. Behavior, alternatively, is generally within one’s control. Inability to control one’s behavior is a sign that something is wrong. It might indicate a mental illness. If a mental illness is present, treatment is necessary.Ask your parents to take you to a counselor. You don’t necessarily have to tell them every detail about why you want to go. It may be enough to say that you want help with emotional issues. Hopefully that will spur your parents into action. If you feel that you might hurt yourself or someone else, contact emergency services. They will help you immediately and protect you and others from harm. Good luck and please take care.<|im_end|>"

My preteen son seems to need to be the center of attention. He is a gifted kid who doesn’t really like school. He speaks out of turn, has said mean things, and doesn’t really seem to care about authority or following the rules. (all of this is sometimes) Sometimes, he’s great. He tends to NOT be helpful or kind and is causing himself many issues. He’s had several school detentions for doing things such as name-calling or being disrespectful to his teachers. He is involved in scouting and loves it, but won’t listen to adult leaders or scout leaders. He’s had privileges taken away, and will now need to have his scouting experiences limited as he is not reliable in that setting. He doesn’t want his behaviors restricted but I can’t have him acting out everywhere. He is developing a reputation as kind of a jerk. His dad and I have divorced 5 years ago and he sees us both regularly and he also has a stepdad in his life that he cares about. All the parents are engaged to assist him in getting what he needs. I have a flexible work arrangement and am able to be home most days right after school gets out. I help with homework, we eat meals together–I’ve made a point to tell him in no uncertain terms that my love for him is unconditional. My other kid exhibits none of these behaviors. I’m at a loss. The school principal has assured me that while my kid is on the “watch list” at school he’s by no means the worst offender. He wandered off at a recent scout outing doing something that could have endangered himself and there will be consequences for that. So far, being grounded, having detentions, etc don’t really seem to matter to him. He gets really wound up and doesn’t listen and it feels like attention seeking behavior. We’ve also recently done Neurotherapy (biofeedback) for him which seemed to make a positive difference–but he’s now continuing with the bad behaviors. Looking for a suggestion, a book, a counselor in some sort of modality I should look for. Thanks much (From the USA)<|im_end|>

I think the collection of behaviors that you’ve identified along with his age lend themselves to a cluster of symptoms that may point to a unifying cause. Of course, it wouldn’t be possible for me to offer a diagnosis, but I will say that if this were a test I were taking in graduate school and this was the information of the intake interview there are a number of top choices I’d have that would at least be the things to rule out.What I am advocating for is very thorough testing. Neuro-Psychological testing would allow for a way of understanding his strengths and relative areas that he needs some help in. The reason the Neurotherapy worked initially is that it provided him with the means through which he could self-regulate. The testing I am recommending often suggest other ways he can develop these skills.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Hello everyone — thank you for reading this post. Let me start off by saying that I am an A student at one of the best engineering universities in my region, if not the country. I am proud of my accomplishments, and I know that I am an intelligent and clear-headed individual. Our Spring semester just started and, I am having a hard time because we are in a wait mode without a lot of home/classwork yet. I am feeling anxious and uncomfortable being with myself. I should have the run of the school because I am in a tough program and getting good grades, but I am so afraid of judgment by others that I am almost torturing myself with thoughts and self-imposed rules and regulations. These rules have undoubtedly helped me achieve my success, but I think they are driven by fear. The natural question is “of what?” and I am terrified of thinking about that question.<|im_end|>

 Since you are in college the fastest, easiest thing to do is to talk to someone that you’re counseling center. There’s a type of therapy, CBT (Cognitive-Behavior Therapy), that is very helpful for changing thought patterns. Because you were new student and you’re acclimating to the pressure, your thoughts may have become more anxious in general. I would highly recommend trying a few sessions of CBT to see if this can bring about some relief.Good luck finishing your first year!Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I have been intrigued by murder and serial killers, it borderlines on obsession. For over 7 years I have been having vivid fantasies about plunging knives into my sisters chest and throat and poisoning my dad. Then it progressed to complete strangers. I have each one planed out from picking my victim, to the actual act, then the disposal of the body and any evidence, even my alibi should I need it. These fantasies moved to urges, so strong that I have to hold myself back from actually doing it. This should sicken me but it Intrigues me, fascinates me, excites me. In my fantasies I’m doing it out of boredom because it’s fun. Most recently I have included myself in them. Making me the victim as well.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 The fact that you have most recently included yourself as a victim in your fantasies indicates that you have a desire to die. It means that you are both homicidal and suicidal. In many cases, they seem to go hand-in-hand.You did not provide details about your life circumstances but I suspect that you are experiencing a great deal of psychological pain and are in a position in which you feel a lack of power. Often, individuals who feel as though they have insufficient power in the world will fantasize about what they perceive to be the ultimate power, which is taking the life of another.There’s nothing glamorous about murder or those who commit it. It’s an act of grave destruction. Every religion considers it a sin. It’s an act of evil, plain and simple.You are on the verge of being unable to control your behavior. In addition, it seems as though you continually expose yourself to your obsession which increases the likelihood that you may act out your fantasies. I would consider your risk for potential violence as being high.I strongly urge you to seek emergency assistance. If you feel that you cannot control your behavior, then go to the emergency room immediately. The staff at the emergency room can keep you safe and can ensure that you receive treatment. Treatment would also address why you feel compelled to hurt others and help you to control your impulses.Fantasizing about wanting to harm others and yourself are clear indicators of mental instability and potentially severe depression. At this point in time, you have not harmed anyone. Should you act on your fantasies, you will lose your freedom and potentially your life. You might spend the rest of your life in prison or face the death penalty.Please seek help immediately before you do something that you will regret and could ruin your life.

 I believe you are dealing with several issues including low self-esteem, pessimism, procrastination, anxiety and possibly attention deficit disorder. You mentioned that sometimes you feel like a “crazy lunatic” but the truth is all of these issues are very common. The good news is that very effective treatments exist to help you deal with these problems.Therapy can be affordable. The two main low-cost options for therapy are local community mental health centers (CMHCs) and your university counseling center. CMHCs may charge a sliding-scale fee, which essentially means that they negotiate a payment plan based on what the patient can afford. University counseling centers offer free counseling to all of their students. Usually, a student is eligible for up to 10 to 12 free counseling sessions per year. You may also want to call the local health department to inquire about what low-cost or free mental health services are available in your community. Explain your situation. They should be able to direct you to the appropriate resources, if available.I would also suggest calling the United States Department of Health and Human Services National Mental Health Information Center, at 800-789-2647. They may be able to direct you to free or low-cost mental health counseling in your community. You may also be able to locate affordable therapy services by clicking on the “find help” tab at the top of this page.To help deal with the attention deficit problems, you may want to contact your local primary care physician and inquire about the possibility of a stimulant drug trial. Stimulants are medications designed to treat attention deficit disorders. You can work with your physician to determine which medication, if any, would be appropriate for you. To improve your study habits, contact the university career center. University career services centers typically offer services such as study groups, seminars to teach better study habits, exam preparation, time management, stress management, etc. Many students find these services very helpful and you might too.To help decrease your anxiety and increase more balanced thinking, I would recommend reading four books: The Feeling Good Handbook and Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy Revised and Updated, both by David Burns; Motivation and Personality by Abraham Maslow, and The Road Less Traveled by M. Scott Peck. These books may serve as useful guides for how to change and improve your thinking. They can also help you to learn healthier models of thinking and behaving. These books are most likely available at your school library. They are very good.I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

After about six months of going to doctors and more doctors to try to find an explanation for some strange physical symptoms I have been having, I was recently told that I am very likely to go through menopause in the next two years or so. As a 26 year-old who recently finished a master’s degree and just finished my first year in a job that I love, this news was not only surprising, but also devastating. I’m single, have always been healthy, and haven’t really given much thought to having children yet. Now I’m faced with decisions that I feel completely unprepared to make. I have talked with my doctors who have suggested that I look into freezing my eggs (sooner rather than later), fertility clinics who have overwhelmed me with information about the process of retrieving, storing, and freezing my eggs as well as IVF, and friends and family members who all have opinions of their own.<|im_end|>

 Your situation moved me deeply because your thoughtful nature and awareness are so keenly attuned to the dynamics of your situation. I hope I can offer a perspective that can be helpful.Dan Gilbert is a Harvard psychologist who studies how we think about the future and try to predict what will make us happy when we get there. I am reducing his immense body of work to a few sentences which could not possibly do it justice, but in essence he explains that we don’t do a very good job of predicting what will make us happy –that we are more or less over-influenced by the present moment and that causes us to make systematic errors in what we think will make us happy down the road.What tends to be true is that our happiness and what brings us a sense of contentment comes from having the courage to face our life circumstances directly. When we can accept our challenges and joys that are hidden in our life circumstance with an open attitude then we take our life and turn it into a work of art.Stay with yourself. Stay present with your mind and your body. You already have a trusted therapist and a team of doctors. It seems to me the work is to stay present with yourself and don’t lose these moments of your life to indeterminate futures. What I am encouraging you to do is cultivate a mindfulness meditation practice. Notice where your mind takes you. Here is more information about mindfulness.The shift is toward self-acceptance and believing that you will be okay with yourself regardless of what you decide.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From a teen in the U.S.: My abuse all took place when I was a child. My adopted aunt I’m pretty sure has an intellectual disability. Nobody ever told me what it was. She always wanted to play dolls in her room to fuel her romantic and sexual fantasies. I only remember one night that she made me touch her, but I think my mind wiped out the actual act of doing it. So, I’m lead to wonder if it happened more times than that because I remember not being surprised and just hoping someone would catch her and save me. Nobody found out, to my knowledge. I would always tell my parents that I didn’t want to be isolated with her when we went to visit my grandparents because I wanted to spend time with them. I was always made to feel selfish for that and I think it developed some problem that I have lots of difficulty expressing my discomfort and talking about my mental issues. But, I can’t help but feel like I have no right to call myself a victim.<|im_end|>

First things first: If you are concerned that your therapist will tell your parents what you talk about in therapy, your therapy will be severely handicapped. The therapeutic relationship is grounded in trust. Without trust, you can’t talk about the things that most concern you. Please talk directly with your therapist about your worries about whether she will keep your confidences. She will explain any limits on confidentiality so that you can relax into the work.As for the abuse: Abuse is abuse is abuse. Abuse affects the victim regardless of what motivates the abuser. Even when there are understandable reasons why a person with intellectual disability (ID) is sexually inappropriate, it doesn’t take away from the impact that behavior has on the victim.Understanding your aunt’s ID doesn’t get her “off the hook”. It identifies where she needs treatment. That really isn’t your problem. It is a problem for her helpers and her family to deal with. It’s not unusual for those close to a person with ID to be in denial about their sexually inappropriate behavior. They look at the person’s behavior through the filter of their disability and either dismiss it or make excuses for it. This doesn’t help either the person with ID or the victim. Now that you are older, perhaps you can talk to your parents about what really happened, its effect on you, and your aunt’s need for treatment.Please don’t blame yourself for not being more direct with your parents about what was going on. You are not at all alone in that response. You were a kid. What she was doing to you was confusing for you. Your parents’ reaction when you wanted to stay away from her probably made you feel that it wasn’t okay to talk about it or that you wouldn’t be believed.I’m very glad you are seeing a therapist. I hope you can finally talk about what happened and get the support and guidance you need and deserve to deal with it. I’m also very glad that you want to deal with this now, while you are still a teen. Untreated trauma can make it difficult to be in an intimate sexual relationship. Dealing with it now will help you leave the past where it belongs – in the past – so you can enjoy a relationship now and in the future.One of the many challenges in working with people with ID who have abused someone who is more vulnerable than they are is figuring out whether the person is a bonafide deviant or is acting out of ignorance.  David Hingburger and his colleagues outlined what they call “counterfeit deviance”, behaviors that look like sexual deviance but are in fact due to such things as lack of information, repressive environments, or lack of impulse control and social skills. I won’t go into detail here. If you are interested in learning more about sexually problematic behavior by people with ID, I suggest you look at this article: “Counterfeit Deviance Revisited.”I do remind you that whatever the motivation and difficulties of a person with ID, you are still entitled to your feelings of hurt, confusion, and even anger for your sense of betrayal by the adults who didn’t do something about it. That’s the work of your therapy. I hope you and your therapist can find a way to make your sessions feel safe enough for you to work on resolving any thoughts and feelings that are a result of the abuse.I wish you well,<|im_end|>"

My ex fiancée and I were due to be married about six months ago. It was always a bit of a struggle with my parents and family due to it being a same sex relationship. From the get-go I knew that she had depression, and had never sought any form of treatment. About 9 months before the wedding she began a slow but steady decline. I encouraged her to go to her doctor about 4 months before the wedding and she was prescribed citalopram. About a month before the wedding we called it off. She had become convinced that she wasn’t in love with me anymore and that I was better off without her. It was incredibly devastating for both of us. I tried in vain to make her understand that I wanted to be there while she worked through it. I moved out of our home and back to my parents. I explained to them that she had been suffering from depression and that we had decided to take some space from one another while she tried to seek proper help, and I tried to build myself back up a little. I made a point of explaining that there was a chance of us getting back together. About a month after our split we found ourselves communicating daily, and on an occasion where I met up with her she broke down, apologizing for everything and explaining that she had no idea who she was or what was going on and that she loved me deeply and wanted to turn back the clock and do everything differently. I found this very difficult to deal with as I had been processing a heartbreak. However I am a very understanding and patient person and I understand that depression is very real and can have such a detestation effect. We began seeing each other again, however my whole family have blamed her for everything. I have been berated and disrespected for choosing to try again with her. Nothing I say seems to make them understand that she had basically had a breakdown which distorted her view of the world. I am devastated by the lack of support from my parents. They don’t ask about us, or her, and basically act as though it isn’t happening. They think that she isn’t depressed at all. I don’t know what to do… (From Scotland)<|im_end|>

 While your girlfriend has decided to come back, this isn’t the proper criteria for continuing the relationship. She has not committed to any therapy, and the likelihood that she might just change her mind again is very high — leaving you completely vulnerable. Unless she is willing to work on herself this situation isn’t likely to turn around. What is different? Your kindness and willingness to get back together without her making some substantial changes isn’t something to bank on.Offer to go to couple’s therapy with her and get this situation in front of a professional who can help sort this through. Your family has had a front row seat to your pain — and they don’t want to watch you go through this again. If she is unwilling to help herself it isn’t likely the foundation of your future with her can be more than what you’ve experienced in the past.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.:  I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 6 years. I do not trust him. I caught him talking to another girl last year but all he says they did was just talk on the phone. He gets angry over everything. Nothing I do or say is ever right.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
I hope you don’t trust him. You shouldn’t. He isn’t your boyfriend. He isn’t even your friend. What little self-esteem you have left is what caused you to write your letter. This guy is emotionally abusing you and financially using you. You deserve so much better. So does your little boy.I understand that you probably want your son to have a father. But it’s just not true that every man who fathers a child is fit to be a dad. Your partner hasn’t committed himself to you by marrying you. He hasn’t manned up as a father since his son was born. He is unlikely to change. From his point of view, he’s got it made. He has a place to live and no responsibilities.What you should do at this point is see a lawyer to find out what your rights are. If you are worried that starting a petition for child support will escalate his violence, look into whether there is a women’s shelter near you. Counselors there will help you figure out how to leave safely. Another resource is the National Domestic Violence hotline at 1 800 799 7233. Counselors are available 24/7 to help women like you.If your boyfriend monitors your email or phone, erase this response immediately. Guys like him are sometimes triggered into further anger and even violence when they know their partner is looking for help to get out. Use the library’s computer or a friend’s phone to get the information you need.Staying with this guy will only mean more pain. Your self-esteem is being worn away by name-calling, cheating behavior, and the threat of violence.Your letter was an important first step toward a healthier and happier life. Take the next one — now! Make those calls and get out!!I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From a teen in Thailand: I’m actually a very happy person. I’m the clown in my circle of friends and the “crazy energetic optimistic person” that cheers people up.

Ordinarily, I would think that what you are describing are panic attacks. But in your case, I’m more concerned that there is an undiagnosed medical problem that needs attention.The key to your question is that your pulse can go down to 47! Oh my! Such a slow pulse means that oxygen isn’t getting to your brain, which could account for the other symptoms.I think a second opinion from a cardiologist is in order.

Siblings can be very mean to each other while growing up. It’s a normal, though difficult, part of life. It usually comes from jealousy or some competition for love and attention. Sometimes it is a way to relieve stress. Although it is painful at times, it can also be a valuable learning experience. Learning how to walk away from provocations and how to manage conflict are useful skills.How the fighting is handled matters. Usually parents let siblings work it out on their own, as long as everyone is safe. You did the right thing to walk away. There is no pay off for your sister if you don’t let her insults bother you. You figured that out by yourself.But if the kids are hurt by their fighting, then it is up to parents to help their kids learn those important skills for getting along with other people. It was not helpful for your mother to support your sister in being mean. She probably didn’t realize that was what she was doing. She may have just been trying to defuse the negative feelings. I hope you will talk to her about how it affected you so maybe she will be more sensitive to your feelings in the future.As for the anxiety attack: It hurt because your sister was hurtful. Your defenses were also compromised by lack of sleep and too much caffeine. Of course, you were upset. Any sensitive person would be.But if those “attacks” happen frequently, you may need some additional help to learn how to handle conflict and bullying. The easiest thing to do is to read about conflict resolutions skills. If that isn’t helpful enough, a few sessions with a counselor might give you the practice you need to be less reactive.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I’ve formulated a friendship with a man who has admitted to me he has a personality disorder (the name of which I do not know). He has told me he is incapable of love. He is, however, empathetic and charismatic. He loves people and surrounds himself with them at all waking moments. When you’re with him he is 100% in the moment, and will focus on whomever is in his presence entirely. However, when you leave his presence, it’s like you no longer exist to him. I tease that it’s “if a tree falls in the forest syndrome” He experiences horrible migraines, and treats himself with diet, and Effexor. He also sees a therapist.<|im_end|>

 I am not aware of any personality disorders in which one of the symptoms is the inability to love. It would have been helpful to know more about his understanding of the inability to love. That phrase may have many different meanings.It’s odd that he is capable of forming friendships but doesn’t believe he’s capable of love. He apparently makes a distinction between friendships and romantic love relationships. If he is capable of engaging in friendship-type relationships, then he should be capable of other types of interpersonal relationships.You have very strong feelings for him. You can’t help how you feel. It will be difficult for you to continue your friendship without sharing your true feelings. You should tell him how you feel.Until you better understand what his psychological problems may be, you cannot determine whether a deeper relationship with him is viable. You need to explore his “inability to love” in more depth. Ask him to expound upon what he means by that phrase. Does he have examples? Did he try to love someone and it was a struggle? Where did the idea of incapacity of love originate? Don’t rule out the possibility that his “inability to love” is his polite way of saying that he is not interested in a romantic relationship.Ultimately, you need to gather more information about whether he’s capable of being in a romantic relationship and whether he’s interested in doing so.

 You come very close to fitting the typical description of depression. Depressed people often feel that doing things is “pointless” or prefer to be alone or to sleep. People who are not depressed can feel the meaning and purpose of their life. They feel the richness of life and want to share it with others. Lacking meaning and purpose, in one’s life, is a hallmark sign of depression. No one can diagnose you over the internet. I am only pointing out similarities and not attempting in any way to offer a diagnosis. A diagnosis must come from meeting in-person with a therapist, who will gather relevant information and is free to ask the many questions of you that are necessary.Gambling and drinking are also consistent with depression. They are distractions— forms of escapism. When you are engaged in these activities, you don’t have to think about your problems. When you’re gambling, you’re focused on the game, your next move, your next hand, your next roll of the dice, etc. When drinking, you’re numbing your emotions. For a brief time, alcohol erases your problems. Those activities bring temporary relief but they are band-aids. They ultimately drive you further away from happiness and can lead to more suffering, pain and anguish; for you and also for your family.I would recommend counseling. It could be immensely helpful in determining whether you have depression and why you are having these problems. We all have the capacity to improve our lives. You can choose to seek help and by doing so, significantly increase the probability of your happiness.Let me share one last thought with you. There is a remarkable documentary about a man named David McCallum who was exonerated after spending nearly 30 years in prison for a crime that he did not commit. The fact that he was eventually released is nothing short of a miracle because, despite his clear innocence, his exoneration seemed unlikely. The majority of the documentary took place when Mr. McCallum was still in prison, when his being released was against the odds. The most astonishing aspect of Mr. McCallum was his attitude. Even though his chances of leaving prison were minimal, he maintained an appreciative and upbeat attitude. He was not angry or bitter, which would have been understandable, given his circumstances, but he chose another way. It reminds me of the quote by Viktor Frankl, a psychiatrist who survived a concentration camp, who said that “everything can be taken from man but one thing: the last of human freedoms–the ability to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances.”The documentary also underscores something that most people take for granted, which is freedom. The freedom to make choices in our lives, the freedom to positively change the course of our lives by the choice of our actions. In your case, the action that could positively alter your life course, would be seeking help. By doing so, you would be choosing a better life for yourself and for your family. Make no mistake, getting help is a choice and the freedom to make that choice is yours.You can begin the process of seeking help by asking your primary care physician for a referral or by clicking the find help tab, at the top of this page, to locate a therapist in your community.

My oldest brother was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia in the last year and has been decompensating very quickly. I also have a maternal grandmother who had the disorder as well.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Fear feeds on illogical thinking. Anxiety disorders thrive because illogical thoughts are entertained as real possibilities. That means they are given more weight than they deserve. That seems to be happening with you.Your stated anxiety level would suggest that you believe that there is a high probability of developing schizophrenia but that is not true. You presented nothing beyond general facts and assumptions as your evidence to suggest that you will develop the disease. Thus, you have presented no convincing evidence to suggest that your level of anxiety is warranted.Generally speaking, you have a slightly higher risk of developing schizophrenia because of genetics but that in no way means that you will get it. Most people who have a family member with schizophrenia don’t develop the disease. You’re making assumptions that have no basis in fact. Fear seems to be guiding your thinking.The fact that you are in graduate school and seemingly have no symptoms of the disorder are both very good signs. If you were to study the lives of the people who have schizophrenia, there are often early warning signs. Case studies have shown this to be true.In general, your anxiety level should match the likelihood of your developing the disease. Your likelihood of developing schizophrenia is only slightly higher than what it is for the average person and in that case, your anxiety level should be very low.It is important to believe what is true and not what you fear to be true. The key to overcoming anxiety is to believe in reality and in facts. Focusing on what is real will help you to stay grounded and to not become overwhelmed with anxiety. Hopefully, those are the types of discussions you are having in therapy. Thank you for your question.<|im_end|>"

According to the Mayo Clinic, “a personality disorder is a type of mental illness in which you have trouble perceiving and relating to situations and to people — including yourself. There are many specific types of personality disorders. In general, having a personality disorder means you have a rigid and unhealthy pattern of thinking and behaving no matter what the situation. This leads to significant problems and limitations in relationships, social encounters, work and school.” People don’t always neatly fit into one or another of the personality disorders. Often there is an overlap of symptoms.You tell me that your mother may have narcissistic personality disorder. It sounds to me like your mother also has a sadistic streak. The connection between narcissism and sadistic personality disorder has been explored in the research literature.If a person is sadistic, it means that he or she derives gratification from punishing, harming, or abusing others. Most people don’t purposefully inflict physical and/or emotional pain on others because they have empathy for others (including animals) and a strong sense of morality. Not so the person with sadistic personality disorder.Not everyone with narcissism also shows sadistic tendencies. Most narcissists have an inflated view of themselves, have difficulty getting along with others, and need to feel in control to feel safe. But they don’t  get satisfaction from inflicting pain.Narcissistic and sadistic people generally have low self-esteem. It is thought that both generally are the result of confusing negative to abusive experiences in early childhood that result in inferior feelings. To compensate, the person goes overboard and acts superior. In the case of sadists, one proof of superiority is the ability to inflict pain. It is unknown if there is also a biological factor that contributes to the behavior and thinking of those with personality disorders.Engaging these people in treatment is difficult. From their point of view (since they believe themselves to be superior) any problems in relationships are the fault of the other person in the relationship. Your mother’s response is typical. She thinks what she is doing is funny. She isn’t able to empathize with the pain of the pets. She doesn’t understand why you don’t share her amusement.  But, if by chance, she starts to understand that she has a role in why others are upset with her, there is treatment that has been found to be helpful. Often it includes medication and cognitive behavioral therapy.I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

 I have been with my boyfriend for 6 1/2 years! I am so in love with him. We get along fine, no complaints in the relationship. Well about the 1st year we had been dating my dad shoved me up against my closet door and kicked me out of the house for dating my boyfriend because of his color. While out of my house during year 2 of me and his relationship i was allowed home because my dad got into a really bad car accident. He soon recovered and started walking again. For the past 4 years my dad just assumes that i dont have a boyfriend. He always talks about me getting a boyfriend. I am 22 years old, in love with this guy that my dad doesnt approve of because of his skin color. I am stressed out as about the time i leave my house and either move in with my bf or live by myself how to deal with my family not talking to me, because i know they won’t because of when i was kicked out the first year. I want to know how to deal with this? when is the right time, after i get a job, to tell them about me and my boyfriend being together for so long?

 As you’ve discovered: Avoiding a problem sometimes creates yet another one. You now have both the issue of who you are dating and the fact that you’ve been living a lie for so long. Your parents will rightfully see this as an indication that you aren’t as mature as you think you are. Further, they are likely to think less of your boyfriend because he participated in the lie and didn’t insist that the two of you work it out with your folks.You have a very, very difficult decision to make. If your father represents the feelings of the whole family, making a life with your boyfriend will mean losing your family of origin – at least for a time. People don’t change just because we want them to. What you can hope for is that the family will eventually come around. They are more likely to do so if you and your sweetheart make a good life for yourselves and if it is clear that you love and cherish each other. Further, people are more likely to make up if they part ways without loud, angry words, incriminations, and accusations. If instead you simply, clearly and, above all, calmly tell your parents how much you love them, how much you appreciate all they’ve done for you, and how much you regret that your choice is something they can’t support, they are more likely to reach out to you after they’ve had more time. After all, they love you and don’t want to lose you as much as you love them. If there is someone in the family who can be an ally, do have a conversation with them to see if there are ways they can lend their support.I don’t know enough about the situation to know about timing. I do know that the longer you live a lie, the harder it is to undo it. I suggest that you get yourself a counselor. You need an ongoing relationship with someone who can look at the situation objectively and who can help you through the difficult conversations and decisions that are coming your way. Your boyfriend should participate. If the two of you want to be together, you need to take on this big challenge — together.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

  I appreciate how thoughtful your approach has been and the thinking and work you have done to improve the situation. Because these direct interventions haven’t worked the way you hoped, I think I would now approach this from a narrative psychology perspective. Your daughter may not have a model for understanding her role with her baby cousin. For this reason, I would recommend reading stories to her that show positive models of being with cousins — such as these, and / or [positive interactions with babies. The idea would be for her to learn about her role though example from the books. Certainly hope this helps!Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

My name is S—-, and I’m 19 years old. For most of my life, I’ve been experiencing urges to kill people. And not with guns or anything like that either. I want to slice them open with a knife, taste their raw flesh, and watch the light leave their eyes as they die. If people on the street knew what I was thinking about doing to them, then they’d probably be horrified. Fantasizing about this sort of of thing really arouses me sexually, and while it’s not the only thing that does, it’s possibly the best. These urges don’t only occur when I’m upset or angered, but those emotions definitely amplify them. For example, if I’m just standing there with something sharp in my hand, I’ll have the impulse to just thrust it into the soft throat of the nearest person. I would just love to feel it sink in, and get covered by the blood gushing from their wound. I’d probably cannibalize their body, too, because I love the smell and taste of blood. When I was younger, I would cut my arms just to taste the blood and rub it on my face. I’ve never actually killed anyone, no matter how much I’ve wanted to, but I a did stab my neighbor’s dog to death once. It just made me feel so alive, like nothing else ever had, to feel it’s fear and watch it die. Now that I’m writing this all down, it’s making me sound like some kind of deformed, basement-dwelling freak. But I’m an attractive person, have a sizable amount of friends, loving parents, and a beautiful girlfriend. She’s the real reason I’m writing this; I’m absolutely horrified by the prospect of her finding out what I’m like. I don’t want her to be afraid of me, but she’s too sweet to not be. I haven’t “gotten help” yet because I’m still living off of my parents, and I haven’t even told them I’m a lesbian yet, much less a psychotic cannibal. I just can’t see that conversation going well. I’ve also often fantasized about stabbing a therapist in the eye with his own pen, so I don’t know if that would be such a good idea. I don’t really want to have these thoughts and feelings, but my life wouldn’t be so fulfilling without them. Why am I like this?<|im_end|>

  Your fantasies are outside the norm. Most people do not fantasize about killing and cannibalism and would find these thoughts to be immoral and an unacceptable expression of evil.Killing a dog and watching it suffer and gaining pleasure from its suffering is also something that most people would never do. It is a socially unacceptable behavior. The FBI considers cruelty to animals a crime against society.The graduation hypothesis suggests that hurting animals is an early warning sign for future violence. If an individual is willing to hurt animals, then they might also be willing to hurt people. Animal abuse has also been linked with domestic violence, child abuse and murder. Some well known killers have histories of hurting and torturing animals.You have already killed an animal. The concern is that you will hurt more animals or “graduate” to people. Also concerning is that you like these fantasies, seem unwilling to give them up, are turned on by them, and have already more or less said you don’t want to see a therapist.Mental health professionals can’t help people who don’t want help, but if you change your mind, you can get help. Getting help could be the difference between your correcting this problem or it growing into a much larger problem in your life. Had you been arrested for torturing and killing the dog, you would have likely faced jail time. Should it happen again and you are caught, given the new harsher federal laws against animal abuse, you could face significant prison time. The FBI recently reclassified animal cruelty as a Group A federal offense, a category that includes other serious crimes such as arson, burglary, kidnapping, and homicide.Whenever you recognize that something is wrong and that your behavior is a problem, then it is incumbent upon you to seek help. Seeking professional help is the most effective and responsible choice you can make. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I dated my ex boyfriend for a little over 2 years and we broke up about 6 months ago and cut off all contact. Our previous relationship had a lot of problems in it, one problem was that he would emotionally cheat with other girls and past girlfriends, then lie about it. I became a very jealous person during the course of the relationship, but had never felt jealous before he began hurting me. Recently we have begun casually seeing each other again, and it’s been really great. We’ve both grown a lot in our time apart and I think there may be an actual future here. Unfortunately, I still feel racked with jealousy at times. I really want to trust him and go into the relationship with a clean slate, but I cannot forget his past lies and behavior. We have gotten a lot better at communicating, and he is trying to be very patient with me, but I can’t help but think about scenarios with other girls. I feel like my jealousy is going to be the downfall of this new, great relationship. How do I learn to trust him again and stop feeling jealous? Or are my fears going to come true that he will revert to past behavior?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I think it is great that you are willing to experiment in this relationship again, but keep in mind this is an experiment. The question here is what is he going to do to earn your trust? As you said, your jealousy was caused by his behavior. What concrete effort can he engage in that will help you regain your trust?There isn’t a clean slate, so look at what caused the issues in the first place and address them directly. He needs to demonstrate that he has changed, and you need to be satisfied with his change in behavior. If you do move forward, consider a trial period. Your jealousy isn’t going to be the downfall of the relationship. His inability to address the reasons you are jealous will be.If the trial period works and you are satisfied he has changed sufficiently, then your trust will grow. Don’t blame yourself for being jealous when the causes for the jealousy were real.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From a 24-year-old American woman: Several months ago, I drank too much and ended up in the hospital. I have since quit drinking, but a few days after the incident, some of the people I used to hang out with told me that they do not want to go out with me anymore. Since then, I have just been a mess. I was already embarrassed enough about the incident, but their little note to me just made me feel like crawling under a rock. I have never been prone to depression, but I just felt so much shame and self-loathing that I haven’t been able to bounce back.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m very sorry it took a hospitalization to give you a wake-up call. But the important thing is that you did wake up to the fact that you were on a course of self-destruction and you’ve done something about it. Good for you for quitting the drinking. That’s not easy.What your friends may not know is that you are as embarrassed as they are about your past behavior. You got a note. You didn’t have a conversation. If these were good friends, I think it would be worth an attempt at contact to tell them that you’re sorry that you lost control and that you’ve quit drinking. Ask for their forgiveness and see if you can move on.It these people were drinking buddies and not particularly good friends, maybe it’s best to let them go. You need real friends in your life who you can hang out with and talk to. Get involved with places where people do the kinds of things you love to do and friendships are likely to evolve. Congratulate yourself on making a life change and set your focus forward to a healthy future instead of back to past mistakes. You’re only 24. You have a lot of life ahead where you can apply a lesson learned.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I am suffering from a serious psychological problem at present I am pursuing MBA from a respected B-School I am good in study but when I publicly speak, giving presentation I badly stuck and sometimes even not able to speak a single word despite of good content and knowledge of subject due to a psychological feeling.

Begusarai has not came out from my mouth with respect to time this problem become more severe now when I start presenting in my class I start very well but in middle this feeling comes in my mind that I have the habit to stuck so when this feeling comes in my mind I start stucking in almost each word and sometimes forced to left my presentation in middle.

 Thanks for your letter. There are several ways to improve your public speaking skills. First, use the resources at your college to help with this problem. Most universities have a public speaking course, and if not a whole course they are very likely to have a seminar that should help.There is also a group specifically for public speaking, which many business people use. There is a Toastmaster Club in India that can direct you to events near you.I would also take an acting class. Public speaking is performing. The people who teach acting a very used to giving exercises to help their students present. This way the problem doesn’t have to be all about the anxiety, it can also be about meeting new people and having fun.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I’ve been diagnosed with psychosis since birth and depression/anxiety. I was in a mental hospital twice for suicide, and i’ve gotten treatment but i stopped and also gave up on therapy. In replacement, i was given herbal chinese medication which seemed to make me much happier yet very angry and sometimes very suicidal. I used to have really bad delusions and believed i had to kill everyone or be killed, confusing reality with made up memories etc and i would become very depressed and emotional but now i just don’t care. i have no interest in things i used to really love, although i dont feel sad. I twitch alot and stare at things for hours and i still repeat conversations out loud, and i noticed i have suddenly forget ppl or cant make out whats in an image like i cant recogize it, same with some words and letters. I’ve had hallucinations since i was young and none of this was weird to me until i was put on meds. Do i have schizophrenia? Do i still have depression or psychosis even tho the herbal doc said i was cured?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
You asked about whether or not you have schizophrenia or depression. Those questions are impossible to answer over the Internet. They are only answered via an in-person evaluation with a mental health professional.You mentioned that you have been deemed “cured” by a “herbal doc.” Herbalists practice nontraditional medicine. In traditional medicine, there are no definitive “cures” for depression and psychosis. Highly effective treatments exist but cures are elusive. Thus, one should be skeptical of those who claim cures. Relatedly, the fact that you are continuing to experience symptoms suggests that a cure has yet to be found.It is rare for children to be psychotic. Among those who develop psychosis, it typically does not emerge until late adolescence.In addition, it is highly unusual for an individual to have had psychosis “since birth.” Psychosis tends to be episodic in nature and not constant. Perhaps it’s possible but I’m not aware of any cases in which it has occurred. Some people may have a genetic predisposition to psychosis but generally they are not born in a state of psychosis.Chinese herbal remedies are not the first-line treatments for depression or psychosis. They may be helpful adjuncts to traditional types of mental health treatments but they should not replace those treatments unless it is empirically proven. I would recommend consulting a licensed mental health professional who provides talk therapy. Studies have demonstrated that talk therapy is a highly effective treatment for depression and related conditions. If psychosis is present, you might require medication and thus should consult a psychiatrist. Thank you for your question and good luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From Dominican Republic: So, I have been told by two friends already that I sound patronizing and condescending sometimes. This really confuses me cause in my head I don’t sound anything like that and I consciously try very hard not to but my efforts seem to be in vain. I have now come to the conclusion that I might not have a right definition for the terms therefore I do not recognized when I sound like that. Its not at all my intention to do so and it’s really frustrating cause I feel like what I actually wanna say and what it comes out gets lost in translation from my thoughts to my speech.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
I understand why you are frustrated. Give yourself credit for wanting to respond to your friends’ feedback even though it was probably difficult to hear.I suggest a couple of things: First, do check with other friends to see if they agree that you sound patronizing. It’s just possible that the two friends who talked to you are particularly sensitive to tone of voice and that others don’t agree.If most of your friends and family generally agree that you do sound condescending, choose someone you especially trust and ask them to imitate what they hear when you speak to them so you can better understand what they are talking about. Then role play different ways to say the same thing until you both agree that you have found a correction. Practice will bring how you speak in line with what you intend to say.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: For the last 6 months or so I have been really angry and lash out at my daughter and wife. I have no desire to finish my classes in school and I have no desires of my old projects that I use to love to do. I don’t feel sad I just feel like I am drifting around and no longer myself. I don’t like this and when my wife asks me what is wrong I have no answer to give her. I because I don’t know what is wrong I have tried thinking about what is bothering me but nothing truly is. I love my wife and I love my daughter. It is like I have a parasite inside me and I don’t care about things as much as I use to.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You say nothing is bothering you — except something clearly is. But it may not be mental. If you haven’t already, the first thing you should do is see your medical doctor. There are a number of medical conditions that can make people feel this way. The thyroid is often the culprit. A vitamin deficiency is another guess. It may also have something to do with your sleep or nutrition. See your doctor for a thorough check-up.If you are physically fine, ask your doctor for information about where you might find free or reduced fee mental health support. Then go for an evaluation. Let the counselor know your financial limits and make the best use you can of however many sessions you can afford. Sometimes all it takes is a few sessions to jump start a new direction.In the meantime, I hope you are taking care of yourself. That means eating a healthy diet, getting at least 7 – 8 hours of sleep a night, staying away from pixels in the hour before sleep and getting a good cardio-vascular workout a few times a week. It’s really true that the key to a healthy mind and attitude is often in a healthy body.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My main question is “How do I stop hating my step children?” I can’t control my anger every time they are even around. I have tried and tried to figure out why I am holding such anger against them because they don’t even have to do anything wrong and I am angry at them.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 My guess is that your husband is afraid he will lose his children’s love and loyalty if he insists they act like the adults they are. In a strange way, he is complimenting you. He feels more secure in his relationship with you so is more willing to offend you. I know, I know — with compliments like that, who needs putdowns?Whatever understanding you and your husband had before you married about his responsibility to his kids, when the time came for them to grow up and out he didn’t have the strength or the heart to follow through. Now you’re both stuck. He can’t figure out how to be a father without caving to every demand. You can’t figure out how to assert your needs without feeling like it calls the whole relationship into question.If you could have talked frankly and effectively to your husband before now, you would have done so. If he could have figured out how to launch his kids while retaining their affection, he would have done that as well. You guys need help getting on the same team solving this problem instead of on different teams fighting with each other. Swallowing your anger isn’t going to help at all. It’s only going to make you feel increasingly resentful and unfriendly to both the children and the man you married.Becoming a stepfamily is one of the most challenging things people can do, especially when the parents are older and less flexible themselves. I strongly suggest that you ask your doctor or someone else you trust for a referral to a couples counselor. You and your husband could both use some practical advice and support while you shift the relationship to the adult children to a more comfortable and positive place. An experienced counselor can help you two learn how to work together so everyone’s needs are met, or at least met enough of the time for life to feel much better.If your husband won’t go at first, go yourself. Often when one member of a couple starts therapy and starts feeling better, the other person will join in later. You asked good questions in your letter so I have every reason to believe that you can make good use of therapy.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I have 4 “versions” of myself. The main one (me) is the artistic one and sees everything in a positive light but can get depressed easily. The second main is Jake who is logical and sees everything more realistically but can get angry easier than the rest of us and is the strongest. The third version is Jack who is a over confident person who has no emotions for others and gets things he wants for the body’s benefit. The fourth one jakey is the happiest out of all of us and is very careless about the body. jakey sees things as “life is short so why not” type of attitude.jakey comes out in a very happy scene or when I get into a deep depressed state. We are all aware of each other and we all share the same memories. They started to exist after an overwhelming event of getting out of a bad relationship, going home to angry parents, and going to school was hell. I was 13 at the time and I kept my sadness inside because I didn’t want to worry my parents even more. I have a history of suicidal actions, and self-hurting actions. There are times where we all fight like siblings but nothing too harsh. They don’t look different from me however they act a lot different from me. I hope this make sense. Its not multiple personality because they look like me but they act very different from me (hence they are called versions) However, I know that it’s not nothing. I’ve decided to accept them and let them have full control of the body for one day throughout the week. Please tell me if this is a mistake or if there is something better I should do. Thank you for your time.<|im_end|>

 You stated that this is “not multiple personality”, but you should avoid self-diagnosis. The only way to know with certainty if you have DID, or any disorder, is to be evaluated, in-person, by a mental health professional.You may be describing dissociative identity disorder (DID), formerly known as multiple personality disorder. What’s most concerning is your history of suicidal and “self-hurting actions.” Studies indicate that people who have tried to end their lives or to hurt themselves in the past have an increased likelihood of trying it again in the future. That’s concerning, especially in the context of the distress associated with your “four versions.” When you recognize that a problem may be present, it is best to consult an expert.Relative to other types of mental health conditions, dissociative disorders are not well understood. In general, it is thought that some people disassociate in response to traumatic experiences. You mentioned having a history of trauma. It’s possible that these “versions” developed to buffer the trauma in your life, to protect you from experiencing psychological pain. In other words, it’s a defense mechanism. Defense mechanisms only last for so long. Trained professionals will know what to do and can guide you through the process of integrating the “versions.” Choose a therapist who has experience with dissociative disorders. Good luck.<|im_end|>"

I’m wondering if anything is “wrong” with me. I don’t feel like there’s anything wrong with me. In fact, I feel pretty good. But…I really want to kill people, and I guess I think I probably shouldn’t. I have found some similar questions, but nothing that really answers my question. The main difference is that I don’t think I would really care on an emotional level if I killed anyone. The thought of actually going through with it doesn’t scare or distress me; quite the opposite, actually. I think it would be a lot of fun. The reason I think I shouldn’t is that I believe I would be more successful (whatever that means…) if I didn’t. Jail seems like a really boring place to be. I’ve felt bored for as long as I can remember. I like learning, or at least the idea of it, because I think having more information is good. Even learning is boring, though. I think it would be nice if it weren’t. Since I dislike being bored, and I imagine that jail would probably be even more boring that my life currently is, I’d rather not go to jail. There aren’t a lot of ways to research “killing without getting caught” so I figured I’d try to figure out how to not kill people instead. I’ve never actually killed anyone, if that matters. I’ve killed animals, and it was pretty nice, but never humans. I can’t quite describe why I want to kill. When I think about it, I feel like have a reason to live. I’ve never been suicidal, but I also feel detached, as if I am living my life just because I have nothing better to do. When I think about killing, that changes. I feel glad to be alive and I can’t wait act on the feelings. But I think I shouldn’t, and that’s why I’m submitting this question. So, how do I stop wanting to kill people? And is there something else that could make me feel the same way? I really like the feeling, and there isn’t much else that I like, so I don’t want to lose it. (age 19, from the US)<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Yes, I believe that it’s safe to say that something is “wrong” with you. Never once did you mention that killing people might be morally wrong, or that it would hurt an innocent person, or that the person might not deserve to die, or that the person’s loved ones might be affected, etc. It appears that you have no empathy and that you are only looking for an answer to your boredom. I find this very concerning. It’s also concerning that you have enjoyed killing animals. Many of the things you are describing can be related to very serious psychological problems, such as Antisocial Personality Disorder or Sociopathy.The fact that it would take something this extreme for you to “feel” is a sign that something is wrong. The fact that you think you would get enjoyment out of killing another person is wrong. Please get help soon so that not only will an innocent person or animal not have to die, but you can avoid spending the rest of your life in prison.All the best,<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: My house mate has been diagnosed by a psychiatrist with depression and is taking meds.

<|im_start|>assistant
 Thank you for writing. I’m sure this is very difficult. You are a sensitive person who is trying to be supportive but, as a housemate, you didn’t agree to be an in-house counselor. It’s difficult to know how much is too much.You weren’t specific about the nature of your relationship. If you are simply a housemate, then it would make sense to draw some clear boundaries on the woman’s behavior. It’s wonderful that you are supportive but you also do need to take care of yourself and not let the mental illness be a “third housemate”. Her needs for attention may be legitimate but that doesn’t necessarily mean that you should be the one to provide it.If she is a partner or dear friend, the boundary is less clear. Her illness has an impact on you and on your relationship. It’s appropriate for you to work with her to find ways to take care of both of you while she recovers.The place to start is probably a clear conversation with the person. Share the same compassionate concern you showed in your letter. Then ask what she thinks is reasonable for support. See if the two of you can decide on some ground rules for when and how long you can give her attention. Another alternative is to ask her if you can attend her next counseling session to talk over what is and isn’t helpful support at home.Meanwhile, if your friend isn’t yet in group therapy or a support group, I advise that she talk to her counselor about whether participating in such a group would help her. You might also suggest that she join one of the forums here at PsychCentral so she can get the good support of members of our community when she is feeling upset or needy. That could also take some of the pressure off of you.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From a teen in the U.S.: Hi. I’m going crazy. Maybe 5 months ago I started to act strangely. I’ve become obsessive with things and I hurt myself when they go wrong. For example, I picked up what I thought was a seed off the floor and it was a bug. I jumped and it fell down the drain. I started obsessing with thoughts like “you know you’re a horrible person” and “if you can’t save a bug how can you expect to be seen as kind”. I tried hard to get it out but I couldn’t do it. I eventually turned on the tap and the disposal and made myself eat sludge out of the drain as a “punishment”.<|im_end|>

 I am so very glad you wrote. You are correct to be concerned. I am, too. I suspect the religious crisis and your self-punishing behavior are related. In most religions, moral judgment is balanced by forgiveness and compassion for yourself. Somehow those two important concepts have gotten out of balance for you. I hope you are talking seriously with a religious advisor to help you as you struggle with these issues.Your stomach aches might be caused by the tension you are feeling. On the other hand, it’s always a good idea to have your doctor check it out if you are feeling ill much of the time.It might also be helpful to talk to a mental health counselor to sort out what’s going on with the people in your brain. It could be simply a way you have developed to try to figure out a problem or it might be caused by something more serious. I can’t know on the basis of a letter. At the vey least, it would give you some peace of mind to sort it out with a professional who can hear your whole story.You are asking big and important philosophical questions that have no easy answers. It’s important to turn to people who can give you support and guidance along the way.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hello from Denmark, I am an 18 year old first year college student. I attend a special college for people on the autism spectrum. My diagnosis is high functioning autism/Asperger.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You recently began attending a new school and have not made friends in the first week. That is not unusual. No one, autistic or otherwise, can make real connections in a week. Relationships need time to develop. It could take years to sincerely know someone at a deep level. The fact that your peers “leave your mind” as soon as you leave the premises, is fairly normal. You hardly know them.You mentioned having gone to specialized schools in the past. If your college is also a specialized school, then other people with autism likely attend. As you noted, people with autism have trouble developing relationships. It might not be that you are the problem. It could be that you are reaching out to people, but they are not reciprocating. Relationships are two-sided. If they are not interested in forming relationships, then it is going to be difficult to connect with them. It could be them and not you. A therapist could objectively assess your situation and assist you in developing more positive connections with people.The other issue of concern is your potential depression and your low self-esteem. It will be difficult to develop healthy relationships when you think so little of yourself. If you don’t value yourself, then others might follow your lead. This should be corrected. Developing a healthy level of self-esteem is another issue a therapist could help to correct.Researchers have developed new psychosocial treatments for individuals with autism, who are struggling with relationships. One of the most recent, promising developments is cognitive enhancement therapy (CET). You might try researching it on the internet. If you choose to begin counseling, choose a therapist who specializes in working with people with autism. Counseling could help you better navigate social relationships and raise your self-esteem. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 What you are describing is consistent with social anxiety. People with social anxiety are overly worried that they might be judged negatively by other people. Lots of people have mild social anxiety and find it somewhat difficult to make friends or to be comfortable around other people. But it is serious when it interferes with a person’s life so much that they only trust a very few people and don’t want to go out at all. That seems to be the case with you.The good news is that there is help for social anxiety. You can start by reading up on it. Search the web for information about what it is and how it is treated.Here are a couple of good books you might want to look at: “Overcoming Social Anxiety and Shyness: A Self-Help Guide Using Cognitive Behavioral Techniques” by Gillian Butler. “Shyness and Social Anxiety Workbook: Proven, Step-by-Step Techniques for Overcoming your Fear” by Martin Antony If your boyfriend wants to help you, he could support you while you do the activities that are recommended.Another option is to look for a cognitive-behavioral therapist. CBT has been proven to be the most effective treatment for anxiety and depression. A therapist will provide you with practical coaching and emotional support.Please do start working on the problem. It won’t get better by itself. You deserve to be more comfortable and to have some good friends.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I’ve known since I was little and on up that I have not liked cursing. I find curse words offensive and see no use in them. I can’t say I have not cursed before because I’ve been around my family today and so many people curse. My parents use to tell us (me and my two brother) to not use that language.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 As I see it, you have 4 options: Move out. Have a big fight over cursing. Try to negotiate some meeting in the middle. Or learn to ignore it.Moving out will remove you from the situation but it’s likely to still go on whenever you visit. If having long breaks from it is all you are looking for, that might be a good option. Fighting about it or being confrontational isn’t likely to work. You can’t make other people do or stop doing anything. If you argue about it, they may just stubbornly tell you they have a right to talk the way they want to. It could even get worse!You might be able to negotiate a little less swearing in the house if you can appeal to their better selves and tell them how uncomfortable it makes you. If you can do this without sounding like you feel superior to them, they might listen. Emphasize your discomfort, not that you think they are “wrong” to do it and you’ll have a better shot at a real conversation.It could also be that one of the reasons your brothers do it is because you react so strongly to it. If that’s the case, it’s an immature but fun game for them. The best thing to do then is to learn to ignore it. If you don’t react, they won’t get the payoff they are looking for. You do have the option of becoming “curse deaf” you know, and just letting it roll off you.At 23, you are old enough to analyze the situation and to consider what your goals are. If raising the issue will separate you from your family, is it really worth it? You do have choices.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 You are living in a situation of domestic violence. Your mother has brainwashed you to the point that you can’t think straight any more. She’s not going to change so it’s up to you. You don’t have to listen to her tirades for a minute, never mind hours. You have nothing to feel guilty about. You shouldn’t have to be constantly walking on egg shells just to have some peace in your own home — a home that you are supporting.Somehow your mother feels entitled to all the help and support you’ve been providing. The financial situation may not be her fault, but she isn’t pulling her share of the family load at all. In my opinion, you should come home to a sparkling house, your laundry done, a nice meal and a lot of gratitude for all you do for her. She may not be able to manage a paying job, but she could be making life easier for you. You don’t owe her extra money for “savings.” You need to be saving money so you can get a place of your own. Even a single room with a hot plate would be better than this.If you feel guilty about leaving your mom to fend for herself, you might look into whether there is housing available in your area at reduced cost for people who are disabled. There often is. Rent is often determined as a percentage of her income.I urge you to go back to a therapist and keep your appointments confidential. Maybe you can go on your lunch hour so your mom doesn’t have to know you are getting some help. You deserve and need help if you are going to break through this pattern of abuse and have anything like a civil, respectful relationship with your mother. You need the perspective and support a therapist can offer you. A therapist can coach you in how to deal with your mother’s displays of temper and her accusations.Please stop caving to your mother’s insistence that you give her still more money. Instead, put your money into getting the help you need so you can free yourself of this highly toxic arrangement. At only 28, you should be having some fun and looking for love in order to make a family of your own — not taking care of a spoiled brat mom.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From a teen in the UK: I have never been diagnosed with any type of issue. But slowly, I’m feeling so lost and confused. Nothing excites me anymore, I just pretend to be happy so the people around me don’t try and console and feel sorry for me. I hate attention.<|im_end|>

 What you do now is make an appointment with your physician. You are not too young to see a doctor. At 16, it’s possible that part of the problem may be medical. Endocrine issues are often a contributing factor in symptoms like yours.If you are medically okay, then it is time see a counselor. If your parents don’t support you in doing so, I suggest you talk to a school counselor or a teacher you trust and ask that person to intercede for you. Often adults are more likely to listen to another adult than to a teenager.You can also do more to help yourself. Get away from the TV and your blanket and do something for other people. Find a volunteer position that matches your interests and that puts you alongside other people your age. Working together takes the pressure off being social. Friendships develop naturally when people share interest and effort in a cause. Being a contributing member of your community will do much for your self-esteem.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I want to know what I should do if I can’t afford help. I am living at home and I can’t control my emotions. I have been breaking down for about 3 years now. I don’t know what to do. I have been dealing with the fact of not having money my whole life. I have never really known my parents and I’ve been moving from home to home since I was 7. Two years ago I tried to kill myself and was put in the hospital. I know that I have been depressed for awhile now and I need to get diagnosed. What should I do?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 When you were being discharged from the hospital the staff should have created a comprehensive outpatient plan outlining followup treatment, even if you did not have health insurance. That may or may not have happened in your case but it should have. I am sorry if it didn’t.Not having private health insurance or money to pay for mental health care can be very challenging but there are ways to access treatment. I have discussed these options in some of my other responses but below I have compiled a list of where to find free or low-cost mental health treatment resources. If readers of this column have other suggestions please e-mail me here. I will pass that information on to other readers.Thanks to a reader, I am reminded of how the clergy can be a (free) source of mental health and spiritual guidance.Those are some of the ways that you may be able to access treatment with a limited budget or in the absence of health insurance. If you feel that you may harm yourself, then go to the emergency room immediately. Hospitals will treat individuals without health insurance in an emergency situation. I hope you are able to get the help that you need. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I am completely falling apart. I am overwhelmed with guilt because many of my problems are self-induced. I feel I am completely incapable of making any correct decisions and I only make things worse.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 First and foremost, I am sorry for the loss of your sister. It is difficult to lose a family member to suicide, especially someone with whom you were so close. It is important also that you know that your sister’s suicide is not your fault. You may feel guilty but that guilt is misplaced.When someone is suicidal, it is a sign that they are severely suffering and likely have a serious mental illness. Most mental health professionals struggle immensely with how to appropriately deal with suicidal clients. For the layperson, knowing how to appropriately deal with a suicidal individual, even when it is a family member, is nearly impossible. Love cannot cure mental illness nor can it prevent someone from committing suicide. Family members simply do not have the education and training that is necessary to deal with the complex problem of suicide.With regard to poor decision-making, the fact that you are aware of your problematic decisions is very insightful. Many people make poor decisions and remain completely oblivious to those mistakes.You can’t change history but you can make better decisions in the future. No one can be free of mistakes but it is important that going forward, you recognize the importance of being correct in your thinking. To be correct in your thinking you need to think critically about every decision. Critical thinking skills can be learned.There are two main ways to develop critical thinking skills. The first is to study the characteristics of self-actualizing individuals. Self-actualizing individuals have the ability to see reality clearly. The more accurately you can judge reality, the fewer mistakes you will make in life. It is important to make as few mistakes as possible because you will pay for all of your mistakes, financially, psychologically and so forth. Read Abraham Maslow’s work regarding the characteristics of self-actualizing individuals.The second way to develop critical thinking skills is to enter cognitive therapy. Cognitive therapy can assist you in examining your past mistakes and the associated faulty thinking process that accompanied those mistakes. Cognitive therapy can also assist you in assessing your ability to be logical and will challenge you to make the most rational decisions.You may have made mistakes in life but you can positively affect your future by learning critical thinking skills. You asked about whether or not you have a mental illness. Though I cannot know with certainty, I do not believe that you are mentally ill. It is most likely the case that you made decisions without utilizing the proper critical thinking skills. The good news is that these skills can be learned through research or by entering therapy. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My boyfriend just told me that he was abused as a child by several different people. One of the predators was a family friend, one was a classmate, and one was a family member. He told me his parents were angry with him for not speaking up sooner and basically blamed him.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You should encourage him to seek counseling and support him, if he’s willing to go for help. That’s the best you can do in this situation. You are not his therapist and cannot do any more than offer your love and support. His problems can be effectively treated by a mental health professional in counseling.Apparently he views masculinity in terms of aggressiveness and dominance. Angry men who feel weak and who feel that they have something to prove, can sometimes be violent. These men also tend to be jealous and controlling in relationships. These characteristics might not describe your boyfriend, but his aggressiveness towards men and his need to prove his masculinity could translate into aggressiveness towards you.It’s a mistake to think that his violent tendencies towards men are an isolated issue. Your stating that he has not harmed a woman and you do not think that he would means to me that the issue has at least crossed your mind. His anger and need to prove his masculinity, could be problematic for your relationship and could lead to you being harmed.If he’s unwilling to seek help despite these issues, then you have to decide if you want to stay in a relationship with someone who knowingly has problems but refuses to treat them. Remember that the purpose of dating is to find the best match and that most of the people you date will not be a match. I would advise against choosing a mate with evident psychological problems who is unwilling to deal with them. They make for disastrous life partners. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Hello, I am a 16 years old boy, and attending my second last year of school. Time management has always been a problem for me, but my grades never showed this as I was gifted as a student. Things started changing at the beginning of the year, my grades were dropping because I was not putting in the effort. I used to play games, and this may have contributed somewhat.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Okay then. Your letter is the first step in reclaiming yourself and turning your life around. Actually, the first step was deleting the games from the computer. So you’re really on step 2. Now let’s get to steps 3 and beyond. . .Sometimes students act like this because they are so afraid of failing that it’s better to not even try. If you don’t try, you can always tell yourself that you could do well if you only make the effort. It’s a tactic that may save your dignity but it does so at the price of your future. I think you can do better than that.Another possibility is that you really are depressed and need some focused help to get out of the depression.It sounds to me that your parents are just as frustrated with you as you are. They are suffering from their own problems and don’t know what to do to help you with yours. Parents who cry are parents who care — deeply — but you know that. Since they don’t know how to help, it’s time you found someone who does.Please consider talking to a school counselor or your doctor or someone else you trust about how to go about getting an evaluation from a mental health counselor. You’re stuck. If you knew what to do, I think you would have done it long ago. You strike me as a smart, decent guy who is as mystified by his own behavior as his parents are. A counselor will help you understand why you are so self-defeating and will teach you some strategies for getting back to the business of realizing your potential. A counselor can also provide much needed support for your whole family if you are willing to have some family sessions. Since you and your folks do care about each other so much, it would probably be a great relief for you all to learn how to be more supportive of one another.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Thank you for writing. I don’t think you’ve done anything wrong.  It sounds to me like your father is too wrapped up in his own problems to understand the normal needs and activities of a girl your age. As you already know, it’s not that he doesn’t love you. It’s that his energy level is so low that he can’t manage being a dad as well as a father. Your sisters are also so focused on their own lives that they may have forgotten what it is like to be an early teen. You don’t mention a mother so I’m guessing that for some reason she isn’t in the picture.My guess is that the reason you don’t have as many friends as you’d like is related to your isolation. You aren’t able to participate with other kids so you can’t develop the relationships that grow naturally from sharing experiences.You do need help. You do need to be allowed to participate in the normal activities of people your age. I suggest that you talk to your school guidance counselor. Identify a sport or club or activity you want to be involved in. Ask if there is a way for you to get transportation to and from.You might also ask the counselor to talk to your dad about reasonable use of the internet. I understand why he is fearful of letting you get on social media. The news is full of reports of negative things that can happen to teens on the air waves. But the internet is here to stay. Teens generally use technology to keep in touch with friends, to relax, and to do research for school and for personal concerns. The focus needs to be on helping you use it is a healthy way, not to prevent you from using it at all.I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

I’ve been with my boyfriend for about a year and a half and I’m deeply in love with him. The first few months of the relationship were blissful, as they should be, and that hasn’t changed, but sometime after month 4 and saying “I love you” for the first time to each other, my brain’s been a bit wacky. I have had millions of weird questions pertaining to his past relationships and his feelings and I’ve found it impossible to fully trust him. He has done nothing wrong, and has supported me more than I ever thought anyone could, even though I can tell it hurts him and is beginning to weigh on him. I guess I’m constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop. I have never been cheated on in the past (to my knowledge), but have dated some real “winners”. I suppose what I’m dealing with is anxiety and insecurity, but I’d like to know for sure. I want to know what I can do to trust my boyfriend, who I do believe is fully deserving of my trust. It hurts being scared and paranoid for no reason, especially with someone I care for so much. Help!<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I think you have correctly identified the problem. Anxiety and insecurity are driving your jealousy.As you noted, your focus on his past relationships is hurting your current relationship. If it continues, it could mean the demise of your relationship. Your boyfriend may tolerate it for a time but eventually he may not. If you wish to preserve your relationship, then you need to stop focusing on his past.People who are jealous don’t feel confident about themselves. It’s the result of a lack of self-esteem. If you thought highly of yourself, then you would not be focused on his past relationships. You probably would never think about them. They would have no bearing on your current relationship.It’s good that you have recognized your jealousy problem because it shows that you’re open to change. What he did in his past is irrelevant. It can’t be changed. It should have no bearing on your current relationship.If you continue to struggle with this issue, then consult a therapist. A therapist could help you focus on the “here and now” and address your self-confidence issues. It can take time to develop self-confidence but generally, life accomplishments positively affect levels of self-esteem. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

<|im_start|>assistant
 Please slow down. What you are describing should be a red flag. Either your boyfriend doesn’t really want you to meet his children yet or the court has directed that he may not take the children on his own. Either situation should make you cautious. This is a man who left a woman with one small baby and another on the way. Of course the ex is trying to recover her family if she can. The two extended families are doing what they can to encourage a reconciliation, to know their grandchildren and create some stability for everyone.As far as I’m concerned, the father should be going into counseling with the mother, not living with you. He helped make these babies. He has responsibility to do everything he can to make a home for them and care for them. However sweet he may be to you, he has lots of unfinished business with the mother of his children, the children, and his extended family. I worry that the relationship with you is a wonderful distraction for him from what he really ought to be doing.You are only 22. You have plenty of time to find a Mr. Right. This one looks very Mr. Wrong to me. I think you should move out. If this guy goes into counseling, both with his ex and by himself, settles his court issues, has a clear and responsible relationship with his children and extended family and then still wants to be with you, maybe (only maybe), he is marriage material for you. If he doesn’t do all that, there is no guarantee that he won’t repeat the behavior and leave you and any children you might have together. Please take care of yourself and slow way, way down.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hi. I have a history of having a relatively short temper, normally this is just shouting or nothing serious. But occasionally when I get angry I lash out physically, so I’ll hit walls or pull on my hair but I’ve never hurt anyone and it’s always been in private so no one knows this has been happening. About a month ago my girlfriend told me something that made me angry. I could feel myself getting angry and started to pace around her room, she could she I was distressed and got up to comfort me but in that moment I needed space so I pushed her away onto her bed. She wasn’t hurt she was just shocked. I hadn’t even realised I’d done it. Anyway I calmed down in the end and we’ve carried on as normal. But recently we spoke about the incident again and she told me that she’s now constantly afraid to get me angry in fear that I might hurt her or go further than just pushing her away. I love her and she’s the last person I want to hurt and it kills me that I’ve given her a reason to think these things. I just wanted to ask the question here firstly to see if you think this is a serious anger issue that would benefit from speaking to a therapist or going on a course or something. And if there’s anything I can do in the meantime to make things better. Maybe techniques that can calm me down. I genuinely don’t think I could ever hurt her, she is the most important thing in the world to me. But it scares me that I didn’t realise I had pushed her. All I want is to be someone that she feels safe around and to be the best I can be for her. Any help of advice would be much appreciated. (age 18, from US)<|im_end|>

 It took courage to write in with your question, and I’m happy that you realize that there could be a problem and are taking responsibility for it. What could start out as a temper control issue or an impulse control issue could easily turn into a domestic violence issue. It’s not just that you pushed your girlfriend, but you have also demonstrated behaviors that are intimidating. It may seem that punching a wall doesn’t hurt anyone but yourself, but there is an implied message to the person seeing this that it could be them next time.I do suggest that you see a therapist to learn to manage your feelings in a healthy way. You are young enough that you can successfully make changes to how you identify and cope with emotions and stress. Your girlfriend shared that she is scared and you can even admit yourself that you are scared that things could get worse. The time to get help is now. Seek a therapist who is trained in anger management techniques or find a group or class on the topic. In the meantime, there are many good anger control workbooks that may help.All the best,<|im_end|>"

Obviously, this is not a healthy or appropriate way to behave. Perhaps you learned this response from your parents or other people in your life. It could be that no one taught you how to react more appropriately. In any event, you realize that a problem exists and you seem to want help. I would recommend contacting an in-person therapist. They would be in the best position to help you.You can also try reading anger management books. Another idea is to contact your guidance counselor at school and ask them for help. They can provide referrals to professionals who can help.In the meantime, realize that you are making a choice when you react in anger. You may think you don’t have a choice, but you do. You have a great deal of power in these situations. You can choose to respond differently to aggravating situations. It will be challenging but possible. For instance, you can walk out of the room or take a five-minute timeout, and so forth. The idea is that you are not destined towards a life of uncontrolled anger. You can make a different choice, even during highly emotional experiences.Hopefully, you are able to acquire the assistance of a mental health professional. It would be the most expeditious way to decrease or eliminate your angry reactions. I hope you are able to receive the help that you desire. Thank you for your question.<|im_end|>"

Your girlfriend’s ambivalence makes sense to me: On the one hand, she does care about you and wants you to be okay. On the other hand, few people can tolerate being the object of obsession. Complicating things further is that you gave up so much to be with her. She may feel terribly guilty that you made such a sacrifice.You yourself said that you are complicated and dark. You might have thought that your passion and attention would draw the two of you closer. Instead, to your dismay, your obsession with her is driving a wedge between you. The solution lies inside yourself. It’s time for you to do some serious work on yourself so that you can bring an emotionally healthy self to a relationship.My guess is that you are avoiding dealing with some important, and probably painful, issues by focussing on what your girlfriend is and isn’t doing for you. Please take a step back. Apologize to this young woman for crowding her. Show her that you are invested enough in yourself and in any relationship you might have to learn more about yourself and how to manage life. Find a therapist to help you get to the heart of things. You might also find that doing some writing or art would help you express your deep feelings. (I have a sense that you have some poetry/ lyrics in you.) It might be important to move back to where you have friends, family, and supports to do your personal work. If your haven’t burned your relationship out, your girlfriend might be interested in keeping in touch and seeing what develops as you figure things out. I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 It’s unclear what might be wrong. It’s unusual to have the thoughts you have described but your symptoms don’t necessarily suggest any one mental illness.I’m most curious about your sleeping patterns. Sleep deprivation could be contributing to your symptoms. In fact, some studies suggest that 24 hours of sleep deprivation could cause schizophrenia-like symptoms among otherwise healthy people.It’s important that you speak to your parents about these issues. You should not keep this information from them. They need to know what’s wrong so they can help. You should tell them what you wrote in this letter and ask them to take you to see a mental health professional. A mental health professional will gather information about this problem, determine what might be wrong and design a treatment to correct your symptoms. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I have a roommate. Our daily interactions are as common as would be expected. He is intelligent and polite. As normal as one would seem. Same employer for many years. Finishing college online, a bit late. Very disturbing thing he does once or twice a day, for 5-15 minutes he goes into his truck parked outside our apartment and talks to himself, screams sometimes. Things alot about freedom, and gov’t, sometimes incoherent babble, sometimes odd numbers. usually turns religious, about Jesus being nailed to the cross, and society paying for its sins. I have recorded more than one particularly “violent” of these episodes should I need it later. He then comes back into the apartment and we talk about work and football and there has NEVER been even a hint of mental illness or neurosis as I can see inside the apartment. Apparently he is employable as manaher of a large chain food service. His door to his bedroom is usually wide open when he is there. ..he studied alot and watches golf. He says he takes no medicines. He REFUSES to imbibe alcohol or any drugs. Once when his episode got particularly violent and the horn was honking and the truck shaking I asked him if that was him honking the horn out there. ..everything ok? He stated: “No that wasn’t me, it was someone else” then added quickly and quietly as he entered his room, almost hoping I wouldn’t hear it “that was my OTHER personality.”<|im_end|>

 Your concerns about your roommate are justified. He is displaying angry, lengthy outbursts. Though it is difficult to reliably predict his future behavior, his present behavior is clearly irrational and unstable. Low rent is a nice thing but not as valuable as your safety.To answer your question directly, yes you should move out. His instability increases the risk for violence. Something is clearly wrong. It is not normal to behave in the manner in which your roommate behaves. It should be quite obvious that he has extreme anger and though it has not been aimed at you, it could be.His symptoms require professional mental health treatment. Hopefully, he will seek treatment for what is leading him to experience these very strong emotions, but there’s nothing you can do to help. Leave that to the professionals.

From a teen in the U.S.: This year, one of my best friends has gone through a lot of issue with his other friends. He really feels like he has no one left besides me. All he ever does is work or stay at home. He rarely comes to church anymore. He deleted all of his social media accounts and now he wants to switch to online schooling. I’m really worried that he will fully isolate himself if he does that but I could also see how it would be good for him. I only want what’s best for him and I’m not sure if I should encourage him to stay in public school or do online schooling like he wants.Is this type of isolate healthy?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Your friend is very fortunate to have such a caring friend. The simple answer to your question is “no”. It’s not healthy for someone to isolate themselves and to confine their relationships to those on line.The issue, in his case, is not how he should get his schooling. The most important issue is how he is going to find people he can get to know up close and personal. He will only develop the social skills and network of supportive friends everyone needs to be successful in life by being around people and working at making and maintaining friendships.I don’t know what discouraged him so much that he is withdrawing from life. I do know that he needs to find some way to get back into it. A therapist would certainly be helpful. In addition, volunteering at a cause he believes in, joining a club or organization that interests him or taking classes at a community college or at a town recreation department are ways to find people who are like-minded and who share his interests. Do encourage him to explore opportunities like these.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I am terrified for my health, and I always worry about it. If there is something even slightly wrong with my body then I worry about it. For example, headaches and I immediately think I have a tumor or something. Chest pain and I think I’m having a heart attack. Stomach pain and I think I’m having an appendicitis, and the list goes on. I find it hard to sleep at night as I am always aware of my heartbeat and find it hard to get enough air, I’m sure it’s anxiety because it only seems to happy at night when I’m thinking about it. I am terrified when I go to the doctors and hospitals, like I’m always scared as to what they’re going to say and what they will find out via tests and stuff. My heart is racing whenever I’m in a doctors surgery. I also have very bad performance anxiety (as I do A2 music so have to perform a lot) but I don’t know if that is related at all. I cannot perform as well as I do when I practice as I’m just too scared. I also do tend to worry about random day to day stuff, such as talking in front of people. Do I have anxiety? And what can I do about it? I want to talk to people about it but I feel silly and childish.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Based on the description of your symptoms, anxiety may be the most likely explanation. Persons with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) feel anxious about many things rather than any one thing in particular. Many people with GAD can function at a relatively high level when their anxiety is mild. However, it still interferes with their lives. It decreases their quality of life. Symptoms also tend to be more severe in times of stress.Anxiety might be the problem but it’s important to recognize that only an in-person mental health evaluation could definitely determine a diagnosis.You should never feel “silly and childish” about seeking help for anxiety. You would not feel silly and childish if you had an aching tooth and went to see a dentist. Most people realize that they should see a specialist for their dental problems. They never feel foolish for needing a dentist. They don’t think “my tooth hurts and I should know what is wrong and how to fix it.” Most people don’t think that way about needing dental work. Nor should they think that way about needing to consult a mental health professional for psychological problems.Anxiety tends to grow progressively worse over time. Left untreated, it can be quite debilitating. However, very effective treatments exist for anxiety. Because anxiety is one of the most common mental health problems, it can be relatively easy to treat with the right therapy and medication. Research studies have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy is one of the best types of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders. Medications often begin working right away and can lead to instant relief of symptoms.I hope you will reconsider seeking treatment. When psychological problems arise, it’s always wise and efficient to consult a mental health professional. They want to help you and they have the expertise to do so.With the right treatment, you can eliminate anxiety from your life. There’s no reason to continue to tolerate a life disrupted by anxiety when effective treatments exist. It’s simply unnecessary. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

He is always beside her when she’s ill and tries his best to support her yet my mother involved in extramarital relationship more than once. When I was a kid, I saw my mother with my own uncle (youngest brother of my father) sharing the bed while my father was out of the city.

Thank you for writing. There are many levels to this question so I’ll try to respond one at a time.First, your parents’ relationship: I have to believe that your father is aware of your mother’s infidelities. He stays in the marriage for his own reasons — probably reasons you either don’t know about or don’t agree with. You can’t change their relationship or your father’s decisions. Sadly, that means that you probably will never have a “healthy family life” with your family of origin. I’m glad that you can salvage a loving relationship with your father. Please do embrace that.The way to the family life you want is to look forward, instead of back. At 22, you are old enough to leave your childhood home and to look for a loving partner who will help you build the kind of life you so desire. You can make the family with him and your children that you never had.Which leads me to the history of abuse by your cousin. It is unusual but not unheard of for a mother to be in such denial or so wrapped up in her own needs that she can’t give her daughter the support she needs and deserves. It speaks to a lack in the mother, not the daughter. The fact that she continued to be unsupportive after you had an abortion only highlights how inadequate your mother has been to the task of mothering. It will only give you more pain if you try to change her.You do have two parents. You didn’t mention whether your father knows of the abuse. If you feel it is safe to tell him, you may find support from him. If he cannot accept what happened to you, for reasons of culture or personality, and provide support for you, then you should probably not look for help from him either. But that does not leave you alone.It’s a sad fact that there are thousands and thousands of women who have suffered as you have. The only good thing to be found in that is that those who are in recovery are often able to reach out and help their sisters in pain. Do look at the forums here on PsychCentral and see if you can find one where people share something like your experience. People on the forums offer each other amazing encouragement and support.I also encourage you to find a therapist if you can to give you the individual attention and support you need and deserve. Look for a professional you can trust and who you can confide in to ask where you can get help for your trauma and depression. I don’t know enough about mental health services in your country to guide you. Perhaps your physician is a place to start.I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

 Hi i really need some help. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I do know that i am very depressed but i think it could be more that depression. I am not coping with everyday life. I am a single mum living with my parents because my boyfriend finished our relationship when i was 5 months pregnant. My son is now 18 months.<|im_end|>

 I’m sure your parents mean well but name-calling never helped anyone. It sounds like all of you are in a situation you didn’t plan for and can’t really cope with. Your parents now have you and a toddler living with them. They are trying to be helpful but it isn’t what they had in mind for this stage in their lives. They may resent it more than they even can admit to themselves.On your side: I think you are suffering from social anxiety. You were abandoned by the man you loved when you were pregnant and are now overwhelmed. You are uncertain about your skills as a mom and your folks are making you even more nervous. No wonder you cling to someone else when you have to venture out of the house. You need some specific help to manage the anxiety. And you need to connect with other mums to get the kind of mum-to-mum support that we all need and enjoy when our kids are young.Please see a counselor to help with the anxiety. Then look for a support group or play group for you and your child. There is nothing so reassuring as talking to other parents who have children who are the same age. You might check www.netmums.com as a place to start. Local churches or your child’s pediatrician may also be able to help you find a group.This is a special time for you and your son. Please take care of yourself so you can feel better and so you can be the mother he deserves.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

According to all my research, I do not have an eating disorder. I do not even own a scale, I have no desire to change the way I look and my weight is not something I even think about. However, food is running my life. I have an increasing issue with what I put into my mouth. <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
A: You are right that there is not an actual diagnosis in the DSM-V (the book we use to diagnose psychological disorders) for what you are describing, but there is a condition being discussed that sounds similar to what you are suffering from.  Orthorexia has been described as an unhealthy obsession with eating healthy food. It is very similar to other eating disorders and also has elements of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and can be quite dangerous. See the link below for more information:https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/orthorexia-nervosaI would suggest that you seek treatment from someone who specializes in eating disorders and also begin working with a nutritionalist or dietician. This is especially important because you can recognize that your obsession with food is not only affecting your health, but also the health of your children.All the best,<|im_end|>"

I’m a 24 year old female, and I believe I suffer from sexual aversion disorder.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
According to the Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders, “The most common causes are interpersonal problems and traumatic experiences. Traumatic experiences have been found to cause sexual aversion disorder, often of the generalized variety. Some possible traumas include rape, incest, molestation, or other forms of sexual abuse. The patient then associates intercourse with a painful experience or memory, possibly one that he or she is trying to forget. Sexual aversion disorder may also be caused by religious or cultural teachings that associate sexual activity with excessive feelings of guilt.”Sexual aversion disorder is a treatable sexual dysfunction. You have no reason to feel ashamed or embarrassed. The treatments are generally cognitive-behavioral in nature. You mention that you have no sexual abuse history but sometimes family upbringing can have an impact on our sexual development also, such as, were you able to ask questions, was sex portrayed as dirty or bad, etc.I suggest that you talk with your psychiatrist first because she already knows you but she will most likely refer you to someone who specializes in this area. You may look for a certified sex therapist or a licensed counselor or psychologist who works with sexual dysfunctions. Just like the social anxiety you mentioned, this is very treatable and I hope you will address it soon so that it doesn’t pose an obstacle to your developing a meaningful relationship.I’m also concerned about the self-harm behaviors and hope that you have shared this with your psychiatrist as well. Self-harm can be linked to numerous issues and causes but is generally a very dangerous coping skill that can worsen if untreated. I hope you will get help for this issue as well.I wish you luck.<|im_end|>"

I have come a long way since 2008 when I had a complete mental health breakdown. I have finally gotten control over my action. I am winning my daily battle more almost all the time, or I was. I lost everything in 2008 including the ability to control my actions, for years my emotions ran everything. I didn’t want to hurt anyone. I hate taking medication but I was begging for anything that might help, only to be told I would be on so many pills I wouldn’t know whether I was coming or going. So I closed myself away from the world for fear I would react to anything in a negative way. I wanted to give up, but couldn’t. I tried everything available to me in town and in cities I knew well so would not put any more stress on myself then I had already by forcing myself to go to theses places. That went on for years I would force myself to leave my home go to wherever my new hope for help was but nothing worked. I left my home less and less scared of what I might do. T hen 3 and a half years ago something changed. I was starting win more and more. I had no help no support but the strength that I lost in 2008 was coming back. I struggled yeah but I was doing it. My life was getting better. Soon I felt strong enough to work. However I was turned down every single time. I was still winning my battle for control over my actions and thoughts but I did give up hope of having a job and moving out of a town that is for me toxic.<|im_end|>

  Thanks for your letter. Sometimes when we transition to a life that we have been yearning for we can feel disoriented because we have spent so much time in the struggle that the achievement throws us off. If you have been constantly grappling with the work of getting better then the norm for you is to be in a fight for improvement. To reach a point where you are not having this struggle demands a recalibration.Give yourself time to get used to a life with less battle. I’d highly recommend reviewing your gratitude for specific events in your daily life a few times a week. This can help you settle in to your new situation.A: Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I did this all the time as a kid, talk to myself like someone was there. Not like talking with myself to solve problems but just like normal friends having a conversation. It will be a completely animated conversation about anything good and disturbing. And I’l look right where I think whoever I’m talking to (someone made up or sometimes famous or whoever) is standing there. I know it’s not real or reality but the fantasy of pretending is nice. I function at work and home fine but I do this everywhere ,work, home, out, everywhere. I used to think its normal but now in not so sure.<|im_end|>

As long as this isn’t interfering with your work or with your relationships, I see no harm in it. I don’t know if it is “normal”. I don’t even know if it is unusual. I suspect that people who do this don’t talk about it much with others so there is little data about it.From my point of view, you have a vivid imagination and enjoy your fantasies. People often put their imagination to use. You might  consider whether you would enjoy participating in community theater or if you have some talent as a writer.I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

Hello I’ve been with my boyfriend for 2 years and a half. We have some issues which made me think that he is not trying hard to save our relationship. I’ll number the problems so that it will be easier to read:<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Thank you for offering such a detailed description of your relationship. The overall nature of this relationship seems to be an ongoing struggle where you are wanting him to be more available emotionally and geographically — but your anxiety about the relationship prevents you from feeling secure. In other words, if we take the entire time that you’re together, a great quantity of it is spent with you worrying about the relationship rather than enjoying it. Since this has been the case for such a long time, it means that the very foundation of the relationship has emotional and geographical distance built into it. My experience is that these relationships are difficult because once the person is available the couple is often lost as to how to function together. While there is some new recent evidence to suggest that long-distance relationships may work, they work when there is a very powerful ongoing commitment to being available, to have a variety of experiences mixed into the relationship, and to share vulnerability. It seems as if these components were not present in this relationship.I think you need to have a very open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about whether the relationship is meeting both your needs. If it isn’t, don’t defer to some far-off future time when it may. Relationships need to be nurtured in the moment, not constantly deferred for gratification.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Hi, I’m a 17 year old girl, and the past couple of years I have many times caught myself wondering if I could have possibly been sexually abused around the age of 5-7, but I have no actual memory of such a thing ever happening to me.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Your experiences, your dreams and your fears are noteworthy. They could indicate sexual abuse, but there may be other explanations.Not being able to remember sexual abuse is common. One theory is that you don’t remember the abuse because you were not psychologically able to handle the memories. Sexual abuse is traumatic and the unconscious mind has the power to block painful memories.Alternatively, it is also possible that you were not sexually abused and that’s why you don’t have any memory of abuse.The bottom line is this: you might never know if you were sexual abused. Even if you had memories of abuse, they are not always verifiable. We know from research that memories are malleable and sometimes unreliable.Your symptoms are bothersome and should be addressed in counseling. A counselor could help you understand the nature of sexual abuse and how to deal with it, if it did happen. Most importantly, counseling can help you address your fears. It’s unusual to have such a negative response to being touched. Counseling is the ideal place to deal with these issues. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 You have nearly made the appointment but fear has stopped you. Fear is ruling your life.Make the appointment and keep it. Don’t worry about having to talk about sexual abuse at this point in time. Focus on current issues for now. Focus on the here and now. At this time, severe anxiety is ruling your life. That reality must be dealt with before delving deeper into your childhood issues.The best way to combat fear and other psychological problems is to focus on reality. Force yourself to focus on what is real. Your fears are based on erroneous thinking. For instance, you are terrified of doctors, but in reality doctors exist for the purpose of healing you. There is no reason to fear a doctor. Don’t allow yourself to believe in an idea that has no basis in reality.I applaud the fact that you are making an effort to seek help. Just getting to your first appointment should be considered an accomplishment, a step toward your return to happiness. I know that it will be difficult but force yourself to complete the call and go to the appointment. There are no secret tricks. Just get in your car and go, even if you are frightened. Realize that nothing bad can come from seeing a mental health professional. The most likely outcome from attending the appointment is relief and your finally getting the help that you deserve. Please take care. <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I have been in a relationship for over 5 years and it has been getting worse and worse. My boyfriend says it’s because I just don’t care.

 I am very, very glad you wrote. You and your boyfriend are both in a serious negative relationship dance that is hurting you both. It’s only a matter of time before you explode apart. My question to you is this: Do you two want to take charge of what is happening or do you want to wait for the inevitable explosion?I applaud your efforts with the workbook and meditation. I’m sure both are helpful to you personally. But the problems you are describing are with your relationship; your interactions with each other.It takes two for someone (like you) to be lying, passive aggressive, and unable to respond. It takes two (for your boyfriend) to be blaming someone else for his stress and pain. Those are behaviors people do with/against someone else.If you and your boyfriend want to save this relationship, please make an appointment with a couple counselor. You have already done what you can do on your own. The two of you need to be involved to fix this.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Do I have a form of depression or do I just have something else?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You attempted suicide twice and regularly think about ways to die. Those are typical signs of depression. Happy and contented people don’t think about dying, nor do they try to end their lives. They look forward to each day. They are excited about living.Many people, like you, have difficult childhoods, but what’s past is not a determiner of the future. You are not destined to be an unhappy adult. With counseling you can learn a better way to live. Things can be better for you. You can be happy. You deserve to be happy. Sometimes, it takes work to get there but that is what counseling is for.When you were a child, you had no control over how your parents treated you. You reacted the best way you knew how at the time. It might have worked then but the same methods are not working now. It’s time to update your problem-solving skills. Counseling is the ideal place to learn those new skills.As you noted in your letter, you have yet to try counseling. Your habit has been to numb your feelings and that method no longer works. It’s time to try something new. Counseling could make all the difference in your life.You can begin researching therapists by clicking on the “Find Help” tab at the top of this page. Choose about five therapists and call them. Describe the issues you would like help with and ask what types of treatment they would provide you. Choose the ones you like the best over the phone and meet them in person. Good luck with your efforts. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

In May my mother-in-law had a stroke. She has been in a hospital or nursing home since the stroke. She has many serious health issues but she thinks that my husband and I should bring her home and care for her here. When we last visited her in the hospital she got angry and hostile with us for not bringing her home & having to remain in the nursing home. I felt really upset because we have really been trying to give her the best care. If she is really this angry & upset should we try to bring her home or should we follow the advice of the nursing home that believes my husband & I don’t have the resources to care for her?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It’s understandable that she is angry. She is grieving the body and life and home she used to have. Grief takes the form of anger when the losses are hard to bear. Your mother-in-law spends hours at a time wishing she were home and with people she loves and who she knows loves her. It’s very, very difficult for her to accept that her care is beyond what you can offer and that she has to make the best of being safe but with strangers.I think you need to enlist the aid of her doctor, especially if she trusts him or her. The doctor can explain to her what is involved in caring for her and why it’s more than you can do at home. You might then also want to work with the social worker at the nursing home or bring in a family therapist to help you all process the grief and find ways to make the transition. She needs help with her feelings of loss and her worry that she is being abandoned. You and your husband need help with any feelings of guilt and regret you may be carrying.Over-stretched staff at the nursing home aren’t going to be able to give her the attention she deserves to have. Working together with the guidance of a counselor, you, your husband and your mother-in-law may be able to come up with a visitation schedule at the nursing home she can count on. Perhaps she can come to your home for an afternoon or for dinner now and then. If she has a spiritual life, she might enjoy being taken to her house of worship once in a while. If she is unable to go out at all, you may be able to arrange for people she knows to come keep her company or to do some activities with her a couple times a week.Arguments about why she can’t go home will only cause hurt feelings. Instead, give her lots of reassurance that she is still loved and a schedule of visits and activities to look forward to.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From Canada: I’ve thought for a while now I might have OCD, but I never wanted to tell anyone in case I was wrong, and anyway we really can’t afford therapy. But I’ve spent nearly all of my time when I should be doing other work researching OCD symptoms and reading the same articles on OCD over and over again. I’ve spent hours almost daily just going through all of these and monitoring all my behavior to see how much of it matches up with the symptoms. Tonight I should have been studying, but instead I just spent three hours researching OCD, and I do this all the time but rationalize it by telling myself it’s okay because I still get good grades.<|im_end|>

 Thank you for taking the time to write us here at Psych Central. I understand that you said you couldn’t afford therapy. However there are clinics where therapy can be provided for free or no charge right in your city.I will encourage you to do two things. Since you were in high school I would recommend you talk to the counselor there about what’s going on. The counselor in the school will help you get ready. I believe you having someone to talk to would be important and I do think it’s a good idea. Additionally I want you to contact your local women’s center. They can also help.

As painful as this is for you, as much as I’d like to help you understand your mother, I can’t. I’d need to have an in-depth talk with your mom in order to do any kind of reasonable analysis. My guess is that she wouldn’t tolerate such a talk.What I can do is respond to you. There is still an abandoned little girl inside of you who desperately wants her mommy. It’s totally understandable. She left you. Then in a way, your dad “left” you by becoming drug-involved. Then you went back to a mother who can’t or won’t “mother.” Most kids in situations like these think that if only they could figure out what to do, their mom would love them. It’s just too scary to acknowledge that maybe the mom they depend on really isn’t interested. So the kids hold on to the hope and keep going back and going back and going back to their mother, hoping that this time it will be different. But since the person they are returning to is incapable of connecting emotionally, the kids always end up hurt and disappointed.For reasons you and I (and maybe even she) will never understand, your mother isn’t able to connect with her daughter. It’s time you accepted that. Nothing you do is going to make a difference. Your mother is who she is and is unwilling to either acknowledge that she has a problem or make changes. Going back to her is like going back to a door you know is locked when you don’t have a key.There is a solution to your pain, though. Your “family” is only as small as you make it. You need to look for older women friends who can give you the support, advice, and even love, that your mother isn’t able to give you. Your kids need honorary “aunties” who will witness their growth, spoil them a little, and show them that you are a person who is loved and respected. Expand your notion of family so you can bring more people into the embrace of your own family. Get involved with the ladies in your church. Seek out a book club or womens’ club or hobby group. Friendships can span the generations.It’s unfortunate you are living with your mother. I hope you will keep working on getting financially stable so that you can get a place of your own. Living with her is a daily, even hourly, reminder of all that you missed. It’s not healthy for either of you – or your children. In the meantime, be polite and appreciative for what your mother can give you (a roof over your head may be all she can do but that’s actually a lot). And stop shaming her and disappointing yourself with requests and demands for an emotional involvement she can’t provide. You’ll both be happier.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From Brazil: I read a ton of articles about this subject, but my case doesn’t fit any of those. My girlfriend is 31 years old (I’m 24) and we’ve been together for a little over a year. I love here as deeply as I possibly could and I wanna build my life with her.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Thank you for writing. I applaud your attitude. There are so many children in the world who need the kind of loving parents you would be. But right now your girlfriend is in mourning. She isn’t ready to think about adoption as an option.I’m guessing that she put off thinking about having children until she met a guy like you. Now, at 31, she finds that it’s likely she can’t be a birth parent. Like most women, she probably had fantasies about her future children. She is now grieving those children she will not have.It really is a kind of death.Taking hormones and not telling her family are only signs of the usual elements of grief: denial, bargaining and anger. With help, she will eventually move to acceptance but it will take time.Unlike other deaths, there are no rituals to help in the process. There is no wake or funeral. There is no grave to visit. Other people often don’t understand.You aren’t saying anything wrong. You may be saying it at the wrong time. You are moving to what you can do. She needs to first be supported in her grief.I suggest you encourage her to cry and to tell you about what she had imagined her future children with you would be like. Be sad with her. Think together about some kind of private ritual the two of you could perform to say goodbye to those mythical children. Plant some flowers. Burn a candle. Do whatever would be meaningful to her. Only when she has time to truly accept the loss will she be able to embrace other children; children who need her and who can receive all the mothering and love she can give.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 Human sexuality is immensely complex. Some estimates, accurate or inaccurate, say that 50% of the contents of the Internet are sexually related materials. Sigmund Freud, believed that almost all human behavior was sexually motivated. He is the father of psychotherapy. He was wrong about many things; women are not inferior to men. He was right about many other things.Like it or not, your 12-year-old son is becoming a sexual being. Sexual thoughts and feelings are awakening within him. Unfortunately, a parent today has to deal with the vast availability of sexual materials found on the Internet. His interest in understanding sexuality is normal. His choice of investigative materials is unfortunate, but this does not necessarily mean that what he has found, or at least what you have found of his, is indicative of his future sexual proclivities. What you have found may simply be a tiny part of what he has viewed and may not be representative of his interests.Americans in particular, followed closely by Western Europeans, tend to deny the true sexual nature of being human. Americans are the worst offenders. We have difficulty being honest about our sexual feelings and sexual practices. We can giggle about sex but find it exceedingly difficult to have an honest discussion of sex.In my practice as a therapist and as a professor, I often encounter the “liberated, modern” parent who sees themselves differently from the repressed, puritanical, parents of the past. They think they are quite enlightened about sexuality and will have no problem whatsoever discussing sex with their children.Their confidence, in themselves, is often misplaced. Are they really enlightened parents who are prepared to discuss and answer questions raised by their children? I have a simple test for them, to see if they are adequately prepared.I start off with some simple questions to the parent. I ask, “Do you believe that masturbation is normal?”They always answer, “Yes.”I then ask, “Do you agree that most people masturbate regularly?”Again they always answer, “Yes.”Notice I haven’t asked them any personal questions, questions about their own behaviors. I have deliberately kept this blatantly objective. Nothing personal needed to be revealed.I then ask them:At that point these “enlightened modern parents” realize that when it comes to sexuality, their future discussions with their children will prove to be most challenging. Perhaps this is why parents throughout modern history, have chosen not to discuss sexuality with their children.Maybe just ignore it altogether. Maybe just answer the big questions about pregnancy.You are facing the same issues now with your child. His interest in sexuality is evident. You need to guide him, in whatever way you feel appropriate, towards developing him into a healthy male adult.It is dangerous to place any object into his rectum. That should be the easy part. A simple “don’t do that” should suffice. You should also make him aware of what you consider to be normal sexual behavior. Raping anyone is abnormal, disgusting and criminal.He is your child and your values, not mine, are all that is important.If we are at all honest, we would admit that sexuality is still a very touchy subject and particularly so in our American society.I wish you the very best of luck. You sound like a very good mother. Don’t hesitate to get more advice from a therapist local to you.<|im_end|>"

I do not know how to trust my boyfriend anymore. We have been dating on and off for 4 years. When we began dating I was still in a relationship with my ex who was serving overseas in the military. I was young at the time (18) and had no idea what I wanted in a relationship. When my ex came back I began cheating on my boyfriend, and eventually he found out. It was horrible. I would go back and forth between the two because to me it seemed like one had something the other did not. My boyfriend began to become abusive and controlling at the time and finally i broke it off with him. We broke up for almost a year (although we did have relations in between) but then eventually began talking consistently again. At that time he (i guess to get back at me) was talking and having sex with other girls behind my back, and became a typical guy, in that he would ignore me for a few days and then call me on his time. It came down to the point where he even invited me and 2 of the other girls he had hooked up with to a party at his house making things very awkward for me. I finally told him that if we were not going to be seriously dating then I was not going to continue in the relationship. He then started to change back into a caring boyfriend and cut off contact with all of the other girls. Everything was going great until about 6 months ago while he was drunk he texted an old girl partner of his and basically was asking her to come over to have sex with him… while i was right beside him. This really hurt our relationship, but he apologized and showed me that he sent the girl a message the next day saying that he was drunk and that he loved me and that he did not mean to send her something like that.<|im_end|>

 As you pointed out, you both have been less than honorable in the ways you have treated each other. Your boyfriend showed very bad judgment 6 months ago. I have no idea if it was the last gasp of an old behavior or if it means that he is still willing to throw everything with you away on a whim. You need to talk to him about it. For this relationship to have a chance, you both have to agree that all the old game-playing is over and that you will both do everything in your power to be worthy of the other’s trust. You then each need to give the other the gift of a new trust.Yes, a gift. In cases like yours where there is so much negative history, rebuilding trust requires the ability to forgive and to risk being hurt yet again. If you really can’t bring yourself to make that leap with him again, you owe it to both of you to break up. You both made some big mistakes when you were young. Now that you’ve matured, you need to find someone you can fully give your heart to and so does he. Maybe you can do it with each other. But it may be that too much has happened for you two truly forgive each other. Listen to your own feelings and trust them.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I lied about being sexually abused, I made up a fake story of a random person sexually abusing me when I was 12. In turn, my father has went crazy since I told my parents the lie three years ago. He has quit jobs and has completely shut down. I take so much blame for all of this. I started doing drugs and I became depressed and dropped out of high school before I told them the lie. My friends were told the lie first. It ate at me. Fortunately I have stopped abusing drugs, and I am in college but with my father going crazy I haven’t been doing to great in school. My self esteem is so low and I have developed horrible habits, it started getting the worst when I got into a romantic relationship. Being with a person for almost two years has seriously made me evaluate myself. And this image that I feel I potray. I feel like I am a terrible person. I admitted to the lie and everyone still accepts me but I dont accept it at all. I also obsess over horoscopes which deep down I know its a load of crap. I literately use a magic 8 ball online to answer questions about the future. If I will be able to be okay, if i am accepted, if my partner actually loves me. Its the worst when my partner and I are fighting. I have spent quite a bit of money on psychics and on readings online. I started to heavily believe in superstition which I know deep down isn’t real either. I have been to a therapist before but I wouldn’t let them actually know anything about the lie or the past. At that time I was still carrying out the lie. Before in the midst of all that I didnt have an obsession with horoscopes or magic 8 balls, I thought I knew what I was doing even though I was drinking and taking drugs around 15-17 Also my romantic relationship has taken all of my attention, I cant stay away and do everything I can to make it work. Everyone still seems to care about me but I really really really dont feel like I seriously deserve to be cared about. Honsetly the only thing that has kept me going is the romantic relationship. Help?<|im_end|>

 If everyone has forgiven you, then you must forgive yourself. Children are not held responsible for their actions because they are underdeveloped, immature and lack a sense of responsibility. That incident happened when you were 12 years old. You were only a child.I’m curious about whether or not your parents sought psychological help for you after the incident. If not, they should have. Whatever motivated you to lie about sexual abuse should have been explored in counseling. Perhaps that’s why you continue to struggle, because you have yet to address this in counseling. The fact that you tried counseling but did not reveal key information to your therapist would also suggest that this problem has yet to be effectively addressed.My recommendation is counseling. It’s imperative that you are as forthcoming as possible with your therapist. The more information you provide to your therapist, the more he or she can help. Counseling will not be effective if you hide the truth.Another option to consider is family therapy. Your father continues to struggle with what happened so perhaps family therapy would help. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 Hello, I have been struggling with complete disorganization, frustration, forgetting, unable to complete daily tasks, keep up with my laundry, keep up with house work among other things. I blow up at my children when they ask me to do something, I’m easily annoyed, its hard for me to have a gathering at my house because the anxiety gets too out of control if I have to make coffee, have snacks or even a conversation without getting up and walking around aimlessly to do something, I dont know what. I associate that with nerves. Meanwhile, my laundry is piling up, the beds are not made, I havent looked in my childrens book bags in 3 days and not being prepared for things my kids need for school. I’m going to see my family doc this week and I’m hoping that she will be able to help me out. I have been on 4 different antidepressants and I also and XANAX (just in case). I rarely take it at all. My kids have missed so many show and tell days at school because I forget to give them something. I’m extremely moody, I get very upset and cry. Thankfully my husband keeps up with the things I cant. I am grateful for this, but on the other hand it makes me feel ashamed of how I am. I feel lazy. I fold the laundry then it sits in my room in the basket for DAYS AND DAYS. My kids complain they have no clothes to wear, it can be complete chaos. I need help. Where should I start and how can I convince my doctor that I need meds for this. Help.<|im_end|>

 My instinct is that this isn’t ADD. You didn’t indicate that the disorganization has been life-long. ADD isn’t something that just shows up during midlife. I suspect it has more to do with the anxiety and depression. It could also be that you are having a reaction to the medications you are taking (your agitation could be medication-related, for example) or that the dosages aren’t right. You should definitely talk with your doctor about how you’ve been feeling and how difficult it is for you to get through a normal day. But — I doubt the answer is more medication. Medicine is no substitute for learning how to cope and manage.The best treatment is usually a combination of medicine with some focused talk therapy. The medicines have the advantage of working quickly (when they work) and giving you a little relief so that you can think straight. Talk therapy helps you find better ways to function in the world for the long run. Your therapist would give you ongoing support and encouragement as well as practical strategies for taking charge of yourself. Yes, this takes time. But the result is usually more self-confidence and competence in dealing with the multiple stresses of family life. Some people are then able to wean off medications all together. Others continue to need some support from meds but they are part of a holistic treatment plan, not the “cure.”I hope you’ll ask your doctor to refer you to a therapist. Life really can be better. You and your family deserve to have you back to normal.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hi..I am an undergraduate student in the last year of my studies. I am an external student doign independent study. I have gone through a lot of emotional turmoil in the last few years. My fiance cheated on me with another girl which led me to depression. This year I broke out with my best friend and have intense feelings of guilt. Also since the last 2 years I was physically unwell diagnosed with unrine infections and was constantly on medicines. I always had a weak memory and needed to revise my studies frequently. But recently since 2010 I have been having severe forgetfulness isues. I just keep daydreaming all the time and sometimes I feel like my head is going to explod with the multitude of thoughts inside it. I keep forgetting my course work even after revising them so many times. I also find it very difficult to concentrate the moment i look at my book after 5 minutes i get up and start using the Internet or start calling someone. Its like I am just trying to occupy myself so i dont have to go back to work. I force my self to concentrate then my head pains so much. Sometimes I feel there is a huge basketball inside my head bouncing up and down. But i dont feel like that when i am reading a novel or simply relaxing. Since I am doing independent study I am most of the time at home.my parents wanted me to finish my education and regain my health back.I am often very lonely. I want to study but I cant concentrate my head pains and i daydream like crazy. I feel so lazy and lethargic. And often I feel depressed because of all these various thoughts that keep running in my mind. I also cant stop talking…If I dont talk I sing to myself.I feel like a volcano waiting to blow up. I also have a very short temper and snap at people. I get upset at very minor issues and end up crying which seems an outlet to my tense feelings. The only time I feel at peace is when I sleep. Do i need to visit a Psychiatrist? Or is it just me being lazy and not wanting to work? Please help me…I am desperate.<|im_end|>

 You seem to be exhibiting the signs of depression including: difficulty concentrating, inability to focus, memory problems, irritability, emotional dysregulation, and lethargy. Depression makes sense in the context of losing both your best friend and fiancé. You have endured two major life losses. Your reaction is understandable.You have asked two questions, one of which is “are you being lazy and simply not wanting to work?” In light of your recent losses I highly doubt these explanations would be accurate. Depression seems like the more logical explanation.Your second question is related to whether you should visit a psychiatrist. Yes, you should see a psychiatrist and a therapist. A psychiatrist can evaluate your mental health condition and determine whether psychiatric medication would be an appropriate form of treatment. A therapist could help by engaging you in talk therapy. Both could benefit you greatly.You also mentioned that you have several ongoing medical problems. These should be evaluated by a medical doctor. Don’t neglect these problems. They may be contributing to your recent difficulties.Receiving professional mental health treatment would be the most efficient way to deal with these issues. I’m sorry but I am not familiar with the mental health resources in your country. Hopefully there is an easy way to access these services. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Hello. I’m a teenage girl living in Cali, USA. Ever since I remember, I’ve been struggling with mental illness.

 As long as you are identified as being the only one with a problem, family members don’t need to face their own responsibility for whatever happened, and it’s unlikely things will change. However, since some family members are supportive, a toehold already exists for making change. From my point of view, then, this is a family therapy case, not a situation that will be improved with individual treatment.If you haven’t already, please talk to your therapist about expanding your treatment to include the whole family. If the whole group won’t come, start with the people who are allies. If your therapist doesn’t feel qualified to change the mode of therapy, ask for a referral to someone who has experience and expertise in working with the whole family in the room.Meanwhile, writing is an excellent way to manage your own feelings. I hope you are sharing your writings with your therapist. You will also feel more empowered if you are doing everything you can to get ready to live on your own. That means doing well in school so you have a chance at scholarships to college and/or developing some job skills so you can leave home and support yourselfI wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I love my dad but he scares me a lot. I feel like I’ve kind of brought a lot of the anger my dad has upon myself, but it’s still hard for me to stay at home any longer. When I get in trouble it’s for legitimate reasons (I smoke and drink and I often get caught), but he gets so angry that it terrifies me, and I honestly just want to drink more to forget that he’s there.<|im_end|>

  Thank you for reaching out to us here at PsychCental.com. Your dad sounds like he is unstable emotionally and the fact that he is intimidating you, has hit you in the past, threatens to shoot your friends, calls you a prostitute, and is angry at you for having emotional issues points to the fact that you are feeling unsafe and need to have someone help you that is nearby. There are two resources I recommend. Here is information on woman’s centers that can help you at low or no cost, and a national hotline for more information and access to local help.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

My boyfriend has a child from a previous marriage. Well ive been feeling like “my clock is ticking” i know im only 22 but i cant stop thinking about having a baby. I dont know how to talk about it with my boyfriend and when i try he doesnt understand where im coming from and he says “i already have one” and it hurts my feelings cause its like hes saying “well i have one and u dont and too bad for u” and he says he wants more kids but when hes ready and then sometimes he say if i got pregnant it wouldnt be a problem and he wouldnt care cause he wants to have a baby with me and it will be just sooner rather than later. It confuses me. So how do i bring up the subject and see if he would rather have one now than later since he says it wouldnt be a problem anyways?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You don’t bring it up. Neither one of you is ready to have a baby. Your focus should be on each other and making your relationship as deep and solid as you can. Babies need to have parents who are fully committed to making a life together. Nowhere in your letter do you mention such a commitment or marriage.At 22, your biological clock for bearing children is certainly not ticking. I have a guess that the talk about babies is more about wanting to pull your boyfriend closer to you. He does have a big commitment elsewhere. His other child will always be his first one. He will always have responsibilities toward that child. You can’t compete with that and you shouldn’t.At some point, you will also be one of the adults in that child’s life. She or he will be spending time with the two of you and there will be times when you will effectively be a co-parent. It’s important for you to embrace that as an opportunity to love and make a difference in another young person’s life. Your relationship with the child and with your boyfriend, and your success as a parent to your own biological child will be affected by how you manage it.When your boyfriend says he already has one, it is probably his way of telling you that he isn’t ready to add emotional and financial responsibility for another child to his life at this point. You should be in full support of his involvement and financial support of the child he already has. How he manages those obligations will be reflected in how he handles parenting a child you eventually have together.Unlike your boyfriend, I don’t have trouble telling you that a pregnancy at this point is a very big problem. It’s unfair to your boyfriend, to your future child, and to yourself. You have more growing to do before you can be the kind of mother every child deserves.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I have been dating a guy for the past 6 months. We met online and both live very busy lives where our careers are very important to us. He currently travels for work to another state Monday-Thursday every week. I am his first serious girlfriend and the only girlfriend he’s introduced to his parents (that don’t even live in the same state as we do). Throughout our 6-month relationship he has taken many steps to show how committed he is to me. For example, when I had received an interview for school in Colorado, he began interviewing for jobs there. For the past couple months, he’s been looking for jobs back in the city that we live in. Despite all the great things he’s done, and despite how much I know he loves me, I have severe trust/jealously issues. My last boyfriend had lied to me and was dating a “friend” while he was dating me. My first love whom I dated for 2.5 years broke up with me because he developed feelings for someone else. Needless to say, I let past experiences and my insecurities get the best of me in my current relationship. I have gotten jealous about his female friends and have admittedly over-reacted many times. However, I have had (what I fear) legitimate reasons to be concerned about his new friendship with a female coworker. Like I said he works out of state during the week. On the phone one night, he mentioned he met a girl at work who’s parents live where his parents live and that she invited him to get together for drinks with her and her brother during Christmas. Fast forward to Christmas, after not responding to my text for hours, he tells me he and his sister were having drinks and playing games at his coworker’s parents house. I got very upset and asked if they had hung out before. He admitted that they spent two hours together ALONE on the beach two days prior. I was distraught and did not speak to him until the next day. He insists they are just friends and I have nothing to worry about. I let it go until I recently saw that they became friends on Facebook. I again got very upset with him and expressed how much it bothered me. He was hurt that I didn’t trust him despite saying time and time again that I had nothing to worry about and that she was just a friend. He isn’t friends with anyone else on Facebook from work other than her and he even works with a guy that went to the same college as him. To me, this situation does not seem right. As I have told him, I fear he has developed feelings for this person and doesn’t want to admit it to himself, let alone me. I don’t want to be with someone who has feelings for someone else and I wish he would just admit it to me if that’s the case. My question is: Am I letting my extreme jealous nature get the best of me and I need to learn to take my boyfriend at his word? Or do I need to interpret my feelings as instinct and walk away from the relationship?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
There may be another answer than these two alternatives. It is often that people will choose someone similar to a person they’ve chosen in the past. Your fears are not all illusions. He was hiding information on you, he didn’t respond back to you on Christmas, and this woman has obviously become closer to him than other relations at work.Whether or not he has feelings for her isn’t as important as the fact that his behavior bothers you. The sending of itself is enough for the two of you to have a discussion. It isn’t an all or nothing situation. You want him to know that his secret-keeping, and lack of responsiveness on the holiday were, in and of themselves, not OK. Stick with the facts. This isn’t a matter of trust as much as it is a matter of lying through omission. When he’s been with her—he’s not been truthful with you about it.That doesn’t mean you have to bolt on the relationship. But it does mean you need to be clear about what is and is not okay with you. If he knows you have an issue with jealousy, then he’ll need to learn the behaviors that activate it.Have a discussion, and if you feel you need some help you can find a therapist nearby at the ‘find help’ tab at the top of the page, or perhaps from this organization.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Basically, I’ve come in search of help with anger management. I was raised with very strict, religious, over protective parents who constantly had violent arguments, taught me to shut down my emotions and to not express my feelings (at least not in healthy ways), taught me that the world is a dangerous, untrustworthy place, and that I cannot trust anyone. As a result, I have grown up to be very nervous, very shy, unable to trust others, unable to express love easily, unable to deal with negative thoughts or emotions in a productive fashion, afraid to be independent in the world, and constantly feel like I can’t make something successful of myself. I wasn’t always like this. I remember in my early childhood that I loved to socialize, explore the world, learn, I had dreams that I honestly thought I could reach. I was more positive, hopeful, and optimistic. Now, I feel as though all I ever feel is anger. I’m so restless. I want to do something, have fun, grow up , stop being so shy, and improve as a person, but, I don’t know where to start. And with my parents not permitting me to go out on my own, or even express my feelings to them without them thinking I’m possessed or something, I feel trapped.I’m not a bad kid. I’m sure of that. I mess up here and there but I really try. Ask anyone. I’ve been obedient, respectful, polite, patient for as long as I can remember, but, lately, only with my parents, have I been lashing out at. Of course, not physically, but I have been getting more violent recently. I’ve gotten into the habit of breaking things around me when I’m angry and just screaming and crying. It’s scaring me. I don’t want to hurt anyone. My parents have done so much for me, and I know they have tried their best at raising me, but, I can’t help but blame them for how I turned out and feel angry at them. Maybe it’s my fault and I’m too ashamed to accept that so I take it out on them? I just need guidance. I need a plan, a place to start. I hate this feeling of cluelessness as it makes me feel breathless and trapped. Thank you for listening to his wacky 16 year old rant.<|im_end|>

 I would not consider your question to be a “wacky…rant.” It is an expression of your feelings. It’s healthy to write when you are stressed. In fact, you should do it more often. When strong emotions arise write about them. Research shows that journaling is a healthy outlet for expressing strong emotions. It can also help to clarify your thinking, come to resolutions and move you past your problems. It’s a psychologically clarifying exercise that can provide a great deal of emotional relief.Your feelings seem perfectly understandable given your family environment. You are developing your own ideas about yourself and the world, which are in conflict with those of your parents. That conflict is causing problems for you and in your emotional life. These types of conflicts are fairly normal during adolescence. In two years, you will be an adult and can live independently, should you choose to do so.In the meantime, speak to the school guidance counselor or the school psychologist about these issues. Counseling could help you tremendously. You might consider showing this letter to your parents. They may be more open than you realize to your seeking mental health treatment. Maybe not, but it is something to consider.Other ideas include finding alternative outlets for your strong emotions. These can include, exercise, yoga, meditation, volunteering or reading self-help or anger management workbooks. Some of my favorite workbooks are written by David Burns and there are many others. They can be purchased through Amazon or you might find them at your local library.I want to be clear about the fact that mental health treatment would provide you with the greatest level of benefit but if it is not an option for you, some of the aforementioned ideas may be of assistance.Finally, if you feel like you might hurt yourself or someone else, then it’s imperative that you call emergency services or go to the hospital. The staff can keep you safe and protect you from hurting yourself or someone else. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From Australia: My mother and I have always had a volatile relationship. Last night she drank a bottle of red wine and when I queried her about it she became angry and went to her room and came out with her bags saying I will not stay where I am not wanted. Since she lives 7 hours drive away and was quite drunk, I blocked the door and said don’t be silly you’re drunk, just go to bed. She yelled at me that she would “beat me down” and “just you try,” things escalated very quickly and we ended up in a physical situation.<|im_end|>

 You and your mother are cooperating in keeping this “dance of anger” going. There is something relieving for both of you in the fights or you wouldn’t keep it up. Meanwhile, make no mistake about it, your little girl is learning that this is the way that mothers and daughters treat each other. I hope that reality will give you extra motivation to make some changes.My guess is that neither you nor your mother has a healthy self-esteem. She only feels good about herself if she feels morally superior to her ex. You only feel good about yourself when you feel guilty for the fights. Neither position is healthy or helpful.Clearly there is something that binds the two of you together. You keep trying to be in relationship. You both keep going back for more. But if you and your mom could stop the cycle of anger on your own you would have done so already. I strongly encourage the two of you to get into some family therapy together. Two intelligent women like yourselves can work through your individual and collective pain and can forge a more positive and loving mother-daughter relationship. Do it for yourselves. Do it for your little girl.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 My Mother and I have had a rocky history, mostly as a result of a childhood divorce (my mother cheated on my father, who I have always been extremely close to, and re-married immediately to a younger man) and her alcohol addiction.

 Yes your feelings are normal. These characteristics — feeling helpless, withdrawing from contact, feelings of guilt, having advice ignored, wishing you could do more, and struggling to find compassion — are all part of being an adult child of an alcoholic. I would strongly suggest you go to an Al-Anon meeting to get advice and support for yourself. Being with others who struggle with family members who lives are affected by alcohol is very important. Here is the link to Al-Anon for information in your area.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From the U.S: Hi. I have been in a relationship for 4.5 years now with a great guy. He is the guy I want to marry. The thing is that I am not ready for marriage yet and I find myself wanting to live the single life, to experience life before I settle down. My current bf is my first serious relationship and I have nothing to compare it to. I also feel like I am missing out on some life experience because I have spent my 20s with him (we started dating when I was 21).<|im_end|>

 I think you’ve already figured out that it’s only fair to everyone to make a choice, but you don’t like having to do it. Indecision keeps both possibilities alive for you.One of my teachers used to say that two relationships are fewer than one. You are not committed to your boyfriend because you are allowing feelings for the other guy. You aren’t committed to the other guy because you have declared yourself to be in a long term relationship.It would be terribly unfair to your boyfriend for you to marry him under these conditions. You are correct. Unless you settle your feelings, the “what if guy” will keep surfacing in your mind, especially when you inevitably run into the rough spots that every couple runs into over the course of a marriage. Sadly, this almost always guarantees divorce. Instead of working hard on the marriage, a person who goes into a marriage second-guessing often tells herself she made the wrong choice in the first place and leaves.If you remain ambivalent, perhaps you should see a therapist to come to an understanding of what exactly you mean by “not being ready for marriage.” There may be more to this than you think.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: For a few months, I’ve been getting these sudden headaches that don’t hurt so much as they feel strange and are very hard to describe. It starts with a sharp, adrenaline charged feeling in my head that becomes a tingling or numbness somewhere else, such as in my hands or in my face, or sometimes it feels like it’s manifesting inside of my head. This numbness usually moves around my hands and face, sometimes to the point where a whole part of my face will be without sensation. I have trouble concentrating, and speaking, during these headaches.<|im_end|>

 By all means stay in contact with your doctor. Please ask why he or she hasn’t already made a referral to a neurologist. Your symptoms are a cause for concern. There are many possible neurological causes for what you are experiencing. I won’t hazard a guess because I have so little information. See an expert as soon as possible.You want to be very sure there isn’t a medical reason for your symptoms before deciding they are caused by anxiety. Anxiety and stress may not be the root of the problem, though they may be making a medical problem worse. The time to see a counselor is if neurological tests determine that you are medically fine.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

When I was around 8 years old, my older sister would have me play “truth or dare” with her. She is 4 years older than me, and most of the time we had to share a bed. She would make me preform sexual acts on her and get upset or angry if I told her I didn’t want to. She rarely ever reciprocated, and if I brought it up or mentioned it later, she would act like it never happened. This eventually stopped around a year or two later, but she would still make me sleep in the same bed with her for years after, even when we got separate rooms. She would always make me do things for her (nonsexual) and treat me as if I were her slave most of the time. I did everything for her until we had a falling out around 4 years ago, and now we don’t speak to each other. I have never told anyone what happened all those years ago, for fear that I am over exaggerating the seriousness of what happened. I know that kids that age don’t know any better, but I feel as if 12 might just be cutting it close to not knowing any better.<|im_end|>

Your courage in finally talking about this now is an important step in dealing with it. You didn’t get to have a choice about your first sexual experience and that is the issue. This, in and of itself, is important because this boundary-setting should have been yours to make.I’d recommend individual counseling with someone experienced in helping adults recover from early sexual abuse in their family.Being able to talk about it here is a very good start, and continuing this in therapy is the next right thing.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Hello, I hate my step daughter and don’t want her near my husband, but I need help overcoming these feelings. I have been with my husband for 5 years and my step daughter is now 11 years old. A couple years ago, she started to act out and become disrespectful and lazy. We tried everything to discipline and teach her how to be kind and empathetic, but no improvement was made. At this time, we spoke to her mom and step dad and all agreed she should be tested for a disability. Turns out she has Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), but her mom refuses to consider medication or alternative holistic approaches to helping in this matter. My husband has zero legal right in any medical treatments or therapy until she is 16. Long story short, this last summer she started to put herself in between my husband and I when he would show me affection. We put an end to that quickly and explained that we will not tolerate her jealousy or manipulative tactics to separate us. Recently, she told her grandma that she is scared of me. This resulted in a massive fight between the grandparents and my husband and I. We discussed this matter with the daughter and asked if she was truly scared of me and she said she was joking. She has been saying things like this about her step-dad for years now, however we know he treats her very well and there is no reason for these cruel remarks. She has used manipulation techniques like this for a couple years and started by playing the mom and dad against each other. I have done nothing but accept her into my life and have her become like a real daughter. About a year ago, her behavior started to change and she started displaying annoying and selfish behaviors that upset me greatly. She still expects her father to carry her up the stairs to put her to bed, massage her feet, snuggle with him on the couch, pick out her outfits and be in our bedroom without permission. I feel like she is challenging and competing with me. Every time I am snuggling with my husband on the couch, she immediately comes and lays on his lap and invades my time with her dad. At this point, when I hear her name, my skin crawls and I want nothing to do with her. The only time I argue with my husband is over her. How can I stop hating, detesting and loathing her? She tried to hug me last night and I couldn’t hug her back. I love children and it hurts me to feel this way about a child. Therapy is not an option for us because her mom won’t approve it. Thank you. (From the USA)<|im_end|>

  ODD is particularly difficult and I would recommend you begin therapy with your husband. Just because her mother won’t approve therapy for her doesn’t mean you have to limit yourselves. Check this site as well as our own therapist listing at the Find Help tab at the top of this page.Search for a family therapist with a specialty with children with ODD. Someone with generic skills will not be able to help as much as someone with experience. You may have to call and interview the therapists by phone first to see who specializes.The work is with you and your husband having a unified approach that is directed by a professional. You don’t want her behavior to become a wedge between the two of you.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

In short both of these are a complete self diagnosis. But basically I showed all the symptoms of PTSD from being bullied and manipulated in middle school and a period I reference as the worst 3 years of my life. But still the confusion from what I believe is my dissociative amnesia which has been causing frequent mental blocks is effecting my everyday life. I keep my head under control and focused with Caffeine. It’s the only thing that allows me to think clearly. But I think the caffeine I’m using to help my cognition is causing me to process all that has happened in the past frequently sending me into episodes of anxiety and irritability. I’ve also been using meditation and eastern philosophy techniques to come to terms with my past. But nothing seems to be working and I feel like I need something physical to get me out of this vicious cycle. I’ve been questioning the use of Marijuana for the stress and psyclobin for the deep repressed trauma I’ve been facing (Both of which are obviously illegal). But I am saving that for a last resort. I know I should see a psychiatrist. But before I do I just want an opinion. What should I do? From a professional perspective, what should I do to treat this before I actually do go. I want medical opinion.<|im_end|>

 If you broke your leg, you would probably go straight to the emergency room. That is what most people would do. It would be irrational to attempt to repair one’s own leg before seeking emergency medical assistance from trained professionals. That same logic should apply to mental health problems. As a non-mental health professional, you don’t have the expertise to diagnose and treat your own mental health problems.Receiving a mental health diagnosis is a serious and involved process. Mental health professionals undergo rigorous education and training in mental health diagnosis. Self-diagnosis is not recommended. If you believe that you have a mental health disorder, it would be best to consult a professional who can assess your symptoms and determine what mental health disorder you may have.I would also strongly advise against using illicit drugs to treat your symptoms. Both marijuana and psilocybin mushrooms are hallucinogenic drugs. Illegally manufactured drugs can be dangerous. The makers of illicit drugs might mix or cut their substances with poisons. You simply don’t know what you’re getting. It’s quite dangerous and can intensify your mental health symptoms.People often turn to illicit drugs as a form of self-medication. Their hope, and perhaps their goal, is to reduce their troublesome symptoms but it is quite risky. I would advise against it.Consult a mental health professional to clarify a diagnosis. He or she will collect an extensive psychosocial history and determine what may be wrong. The longer you wait to seek professional help, the worse your symptoms may become. The most efficient way to deal with this problem is to seek help now and not wait. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I took a nap a little bit ago for about an hour but something really strange happened. It started out with the dream I ended up having felt so real, I thought it was in real life. Now that I know it was a dream, I can’t really understand how I felt that the dream was actually real life. It turned out to be a nightmare-ish dream, at one point I got chased by construction workers with staple guns trying to kill me. Early in the dream, I had gotten high with a few of my friends but for some reason it made my breathing really labored. It suddenly got hard to breath, hard to walk and move, hard to see. It wasn’t a head rush in the dream, because it lasted for a while. (Most of my dreams are very realistic, but I’ve only felt thee real life thing a few times) Half way through the dream I figured out that it was just a dream, not real life. Usually when this happens I’m able to wake myself up, or the dream ends and I wake up, and it usually only lasts for a few seconds longer after figuring out it was a dream. But this time was different. Immediately as I realized it was a dream I was suddenly able to breath better (I was literally able to feel how hard the breathing was.) I tried to open my eyes but they wouldn’t open. I can feel my self awake now, I know I’m laying on my bed and it’s just a dream but I’m not able to wake up from it. At this moment I can remember feeling myself trying to force them open with sheer eye lid strength but still nothing. After failing at least 3 times I must have went fully back into dream land, somehow still knowing it was a dream. I have no idea how to explain this, it was very scary. The breathing and the not being able to wake up, everything was so strange… I just want to know if this is some sort of medical/physical condition. Am I the only person this has happened too? I looked it up but everyone is saying that their dreams were already finished when they tired to open their eyes but I was still in a dream when it happened to me. ?<|im_end|>

From the U.S.: My mother died when I was 15 from breast cancer. Growing up, her and I never spoke or had conversations. I knew little about her. My father had been making sexual comments me since I was 12 – would encourage me to dress up in my mom’s clothes, take photos of me, and then take them to work and call me a whore. He also had this paranoid obsession that I was going to turn him in for molesting me at 12.<|im_end|>

 It’s so very sad but true that not every kid gets the family that she deserves. You certainly didn’t. You were living under constant threat of sexual abuse. In a twisted way, it may be that your father did you a favor throwing you out of the house. He may have known at least on an unconscious level that he could no longer control his impulses to try to have sex with you.Please give yourself lots of credit for having the resiliency and strength of character to survive and thrive in spite of such a rough beginning. I hope you have surrounded yourself with a “framily” — friends who have become a family that loves and supports you.Unfortunately, there is no way to “make” your uncle stop contacting you unless he has done things that are serious enough to warrant a restraining order. What you can do is learn not to let it bother you.As you rightly point out, you don’t know these people. You don’t owe them anything. They weren’t there for you when you were growing up and they have nothing to offer you now. You have every right to ignore their attempts at contact. You needn’t feel guilty about not responding. Being angry gives them more energy than they deserve.Treat messages from them just like you treat “junk mail.” Toss it out and forget it. Focus on the people in your life who matter, not those who don’t.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Being successful works against me because no one understands why I’m so insecure. When it comes to school, work, finances, I feel like I have things together. Even though I feel like I don’t really know what I’m doing I manage to keep things together on my own and be successful. However, when it comes to relationships, I feel handicapped. In the past 5 years I finally realized that I was physically abused, emotionally abused, neglected by my parents and I let this happen to me until the age of 21 when I finally moved out after my mom cornered me and beat me up for asking her to calm down. I always felt like I was walking in a fog, going through the motions, trying to be normal but not quite achieving it. It wasn’t until I was 24 and started to realize that I was gay that I started really connecting to my own reality and realized that I was abused. I feel like being successful works against me because everyone thinks I’m normal and such a pleasant person, but when I’m in relationships, my partners can’t handle me. They feel I’m too demanding, too needy, I make them anxious and make them want to pull away from me. They don’t understand how I’m so successful and yet so insecure. I feel so embarrassed because of this. This makes me hide my needs from everyone and avoid relationships because I think I’m defective and that no one could ever really handle me. I feel like no one sees me for who I am and only sees everything that I’m not. A couple of friends have told me to lighten up and enjoy relationships, but I can’t. I don’t want anyone to take advantage of me or to leave me, and I get scared and my heart pounds out of my chest if anything goes wrong. I was taken advantage of and emotionally abused in my first relationship, and I don’t want it to happen again. I’ve been to counselors but they seem to think I’m completely ok and that I just need to lighten up and change my thoughts. I’ve done cognitive behavioral therapy and it works well when I’m single, but in relationships it makes no difference. I feel like logic is out of the window and its a deeper issue than my thoughts. I’m so afraid someone will hurt me and I don’t trust anyone. I think I also have this need to please people, so sometimes in therapy I let the therapist take over and I feel worse after the session cause I didn’t get to really say what I wanted to. I don’t know if I’m just complaining over stupid little things and I do just need to lighten up but I’m writing because I want to know if either I’m making things too serious or if maybe I need a different kind of therapist. I started researching and I think I might have ptsd but I’m afraid to tell people that because they may think I’m over exaggerating my problems and self diagnosing which you aren’t supposed to do. I’d appreciate your feedback.<|im_end|>

 Thank you for sending in just a thought-provoking question. The issues that you are bringing to light should be brought to your therapist. The struggle for intimacy is great, and the resilience you have shown in moving toward understanding and cooping with these problems. I would elaborate with your therapist the particular struggle with trust and the history of your relationships if you haven’t done this already.This will give you a chance to develop a bit more trust with the therapist. This is important because often the relationship we have in therapy mirrors the relationships that we long to develop. Being vulnerable, and being willing to discuss these issues is perhaps the most direct way of allowing yourself to change.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I need help knowing how to deal with this by myself: My ocd got worse about a year ago, my best friend started struggling with health problems and I began struggling with rituals. I already had problems with checking things, now my anxiety is so so terrible, I am now overwhelmed with the fear of harming others with thoughts or not doing rituals..I know how crazy this sounds! And I dont know how Ive become this..I feel crazy, and its not something I can talk about to anyone, its causing problems with the ones I love, so I keep it to myself..but I need to end it. I was so happy before, now Im often depressed and Im desperate to find a way to end this and be normal again! To fix it myself..I also struggle with intrusive thoughts, please help me :( I am so young and I am terrified of looking back with regrets of this being all that I am and held me back :( thank you.<|im_end|>

 You are not “crazy.” You’re dealing with an anxiety issue. Millions of individuals struggle with anxiety problems. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which you may or may not have, is characterized by unwanted intrusive thoughts or obsessions that compel individuals to engage in ritualistic behavior in an attempt to decrease their anxiety. Though it is not true for everyone, many individuals develop OCD after a trauma-related incident or a significant loss.I would not recommend that you continue to try to fix this problem yourself because as you’ve stated, it has become worse, not better. That is the nature of anxiety disorders, particularly OCD. The more that you engage in your rituals, the more you reinforce those behaviors and thus the problem intensifies.The wisest and most efficient solution to this problem would be to see a therapist who specializes in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). There are very targeted treatments that deal specifically with OCD, primarily, exposure and response prevention therapy.This problem requires professional help. The sooner that you seek professional help, the sooner you can be anxiety-free. The find help tab, at the top of this page, can assist you in locating the appropriate mental health professionals in your community. Be certain to choose a therapist who specializes in obsessive-compulsive disorder or in exposure and response prevention therapy. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 Thank you for writing us. Your husband needs to be much more directly involved with his family concerning how they treat you. This sense of entitlement, mistreatment and alienation is something that you and your husband need to address together. Dynamics like this are designed to split the two of you apart. The most important thing is for you and your husband to be on the same page with how to deal with them.This does that mean isolating or alienating yourself. Offering them invitations to come to your place and you and your husband having a plan for how to receive them would be important. Going back onto their turf seems like a bad idea. When you were there, the treatment of you was horrific. Why put yourself in their crosshairs again? If they don’t understand that relationships are based on mutual trust and respect, then you don’t have to put yourself at risk, particularly if your husband isn’t supportive.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I am writing you because I recently received some sessions at a local community therapy clinic and I don’t feel like we accomplished anything there. I am constantly thinking about suicide, or (I’m ashamed to say) faking a suicide so that I can get help. I was fired from my job about 2 months ago and haven’t been able to get another one. I recently started college and I am having to appeal a financial aid denial due to missing dropping the one class I registered for when I was 17. I have no family to look to for financial support and my situation gets more and more desperate every day.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It is good that you have begun your therapy at your community mental health agency but you think it may not be helping. Talk to your therapist and be honest about the fact that you feel your work together is not effective. In many clinics, it is relatively common for clients to try several therapists before they find a suitable match.In addition to individual therapy, you should also consider group therapy. Some individuals prefer group therapy over individual therapy. There are several advantages of group therapy, including: increased support, increased feedback, increased interactional opportunities, and the chance to practice and to develop social skills. The more people that you can make a positive connection with, the better you will feel. Group therapy is also generally less expensive when compared to individual therapy.You may also want to investigate the counseling services offered by your college. Most colleges provide their students with short-term, professional mental health care free of charge.If you were to get a job or were granted the necessary financial aid to continue college, I believe that your mindset would change. It is important to keep your situation in perspective. It is a difficult time in your life but that can change. There are many ups and downs in life. That is true for everyone.Your lack of social support is also contributing to the problem. If you had more support from friends or from family, then you would be less likely to consider suicide. That is one reason why it is imperative for you to stay connected to a mental health agency, and you can do this by joining a support group or by finding a different therapist.Individuals who are considering suicide often view their life situation through a prism of hopelessness. Their difficult situation is temporary but they don’t see it that way. They have difficulty envisioning an end to their suffering. Understandably they want their pain to end. Getting help is the answer, not suicide.I would recommend that you read this article about individuals who attempted suicide and survived. One of the most important messages of the article is that the individuals who attempted suicide and survived were thankful to have lived. In the depths of depression, they incorrectly predicted that their lives would never improve. They were fortunate enough to live to see their lives improve.Don’t stop trying to get help. Try other therapists. Investigate other types of treatment such as group therapy or psychiatric medication. Remember that even though your life is difficult now it can change. Call 911 or go to the emergency room if you feel that you cannot keep yourself safe. I wish you the best. Take care.<|im_end|>"

For as long as I can remember I have had extreme anxiety issues. I have social anxiety, but the main source of my anxiety is my health. I can’t do anything, and I mean anything without worrying that I am going to die. For example, me and my family went to Disneyland the other day, I was having panic attacks and worrying that I would either just drop dead for no reason or since I had a little bit of a headache that day I was scared was going to have a brain aneurysm. Its always something everyday with my health, it’s exhuasting. All I want to do is sleep all day or just zone out in front of the TV so I dont have to think.<|im_end|>

 Thank you for writing. The first thing to do is to go back to the doctor who prescribed the Effexor. The period of time that a postpartum depression generally lasts is long over. If you haven’t been back for a discussion about your symptoms and how you are doing on the medication, you should immediately make an appointment. One of the potential side effects of Effexor is anxiety. What you are taking for depression may possibly be contributing to your anxiety. If your PCP or OB-GYN has been prescribing your medication, I do suggest you see a psychiatrist to get a specialist’s take on whether you still need the medication or if you are taking the right one.Meanwhile — you really should consider finding some therapy for yourself. Some cognitive-behavioral therapy could help you get your anxiety under more control so that you can enjoy life. I know you have no health insurance. Before you give up on the idea of getting any help, I do suggest that you talk with your doctor or spiritual leader about any free or low-cost resources that may be available in your area. Many private therapists also offer a sliding fee scale or low-income slots.Please be more concerned about finding treatment and less concerned about finding a label for yourself. As you said, the important thing is to get back to feeling “normal.” You deserve it. Your daughter deserves to have a mom who feels stable and able to cope.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I’m a 23 year old male, and I have kind of a strange question for you. So, when I was younger and growing up, I was improved in a youth leadership development program. When I got too old to participate in it as one of the kids, I became one of the adult leaders. I am now finding myself getting involved in more and more youth groups, everything from youth leadership development groups to youth community service groups. I do have feelings for these kids, but not in any sexual way. These feelings are more like the way I feel about family or close friends. I don’t have any types of “sexual fantasies” about these kids, and I would never hurt one of them in any way. I want to help them and see them be the absolute best person that they can be. In my occupation as a firefighter/paramedic, I always want to be the one on the pediatric calls just because in my mind I believe that I can care for them better than others at my department and I want the kids to get the best possible care (which in all reality, the other paramedics can give just as good of care). So, my question is, since I am obsessed with kids and youth groups, am I becoming a pedophile?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Pedophilia involves the sexual attraction to prepubescent children, generally under the age of 13. According to the DSM-IV-TR, the onset of pedophilia typically begins in adolescence though some have reported that they did not experience arousal by children until middle age. To be diagnosed with pedophilia, an individual would have had to experience, over a period of at least six months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal, fantasies or sexual urges toward a child 13 years old or younger, and to have acted upon those sexual urges.No information was provided about your sexual history or sexual orientation but you did explicitly state that you do not have sexual fantasies about children. You also stated that you feel about these children the way you feel about close friends and family. I cannot know this with certainty because of the very limited information provided but in the absence of sexual attraction toward children, it seems unlikely that you are at risk of becoming a pedophile.Pedophilia is a horrific crime that ruins the lives of innocent children, families and communities. If you continue to be concerned about this issue, then meet with a mental health professional for an evaluation. Let me emphatically state that you have a responsibility to take every conceivable precaution to prevent the harm of innocent children. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 It seems as though many of the issues you are struggling with are related to anxiety. Your anxiety is significantly degrading your life. If not treated, it may worsen. Avoidance is a strategy that many people use in an attempt to deal with anxiety, but it can backfire. It usually makes the anxiety symptoms worse, not better.The problems that you are dealing with are correctable in therapy. I would suggest that you consider it. Please don’t be embarrassed to ask for help. Asking for help is a commendable act. It’s a sign that somebody is ready to make a life change for the better. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I have a history of drug addiction and would like to stay clear from all medications. How can I get control of this?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I would recommend having a medical evaluation. It is important to rule out a physical problem.If you choose to have a medical evaluation, be certain to inform the physician about your history of drug addiction. That information is important because it may be contributing to your attention difficulties. The physician can make that determination.You should also consider seeing a therapist. Seeing a therapist would be advantageous for several reasons. One reason would be that he or she could objectively evaluate your situation and make a determination about the problem.Secondly, a therapist could evaluate the manner in which you study. Perhaps your study habits are contributing to the problem. In addition, a therapist could evaluate whether or not you have an attention-deficit disorder.In the meantime, I would recommend that you conduct a thorough examination of your study habits. For example, what time of day do you study? Do you study after a long day of work and are understandably tired? The time of day that you study could have a major impact on your ability to focus. Trying to study after a long day of work would be a very difficult challenge for most people.What about the lighting in the room? Do you study with the television on? What other distractions are in the room when you are studying? There is a great deal of research that suggests that multitasking is very inefficient. When it comes to studying, watching television or listening to the radio would not be recommended.I would also recommend educating yourself about attention-deficit disorders and strategies for increasing attention span. There are many books written on the subject.I hope that I have helped. I wish you the best of luck on your continued studies.<|im_end|>"

About a year ago I developed severe anxiety and had several panic attacks a day. Over time I developed more and more symptoms such as intrusive thoughts etc. However after quite some time I developed very worrying symptoms that make me think I am developing schiz/psychosis.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It’s common for people with anxiety to believe that they are developing schizophrenia. As I’ve said many times in this column, it is one of the most common questions that I receive here at Psych Central. People with anxiety disorders tend to believe that the worst will happen to them. In the minds of many people, schizophrenia is the worst case scenario and thus they worry that they’re going to develop it.The fact that you were evaluated by mental health professionals and were diagnosed with anxiety disorders would indicate that you do not have schizophrenia or a related disorder. Your fears about schizophrenia are likely a symptom of your anxiety disorders. It was likely something that your evaluators recognized and factored into their evaluation and diagnosis.It’s also important to remember that their opinion is objective. Your opinion, however, is not. Your views are being filtered through fear. Fear clouds judgment which can lead to incorrect conclusions.Your evaluators likely recommended treatment. Anxiety disorders are highly responsive to treatment. Cognitive behavioral therapy and medication are effective treatments for anxiety disorders.In the meantime, it’s important to believe in facts. They will help you stay grounded in reality which will ultimately decrease your anxiety. It is factual to state that you were diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and not a psychotic disorder. That should ease your anxiety. Believing in truth and reality is the best way to ease anxiety. That’s something you will learn in counseling.Treatment will help you tremendously. I hope you will try it.<|im_end|>"

I am fairly convinced that my wife has some degree of bi-polar disorder. She goes into fits of rage over any question about her, her parents or upbringing. She constantly belittles me and talks bad about my family to the children.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It’s unclear whether your wife has bipolar disorder. Emotionally she is unstable but it might be due to her drinking. The fact that she is drinking makes it difficult to determine if a mental health disorder is present or if her drinking is the main problem. It may be a combination of both but I cannot make that determination based on this short letter.What is clear is that your wife’s drinking is excessive and is causing a great deal of distress for your marriage and for your children. Both you and the children are subjected to her tirades. It’s abusive, unacceptable and something needs to change.Encourage her to seek psychological treatment or inpatient rehabilitation if necessary. If she is unwilling to seek treatment, then you must take action. This might include seeking psychological help for yourself so that you know how best to deal with your wife or temporarily moving out of the home. Your children should not be subjected to your wife’s tirades. It most certainly frightens them and it’s abusive.You may also want to consider an intervention. By this I mean you and members of your family come together as a group and ask your wife to seek help. During the intervention, members of the group describe how her behavior is affecting them and ask her to receive help. Perhaps she would be willing to seek help if she knew how her behavior was negatively affecting friends and family.I can confirm the fact that there is a problem but I cannot determine the precise problem that is causing your wife to behave in such an unstable manner. Utilize the help of mental health professionals to assist you in dealing with your wife and children. I firmly believe that trained mental health professionals can give you the best advice about how to proceed. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From a teen in Australia: When I was a small child, I had a hard time controlling my anger, distress or any feelings of anxiety. My behaviour would sporadically change from isolating myself (hiding in a closet) to lashing out at others (verbally and I would physically intimidate, but never attack). But I also have a few memories of seeking out attention via coming up with poorly-constructed lies and faking injuries.<|im_end|>

 That opposites are the same thing is an idea that goes back at least as far as the ancient Greeks. Hippolytus said that the road up and the road down are the same. This is called the unity of opposites.These days, we would say that behaviors that are apparently very different are only two sides of the same coin. In your case, you have gone from being overly empathic to being uncaring. You’ve gone from desperate attempts to help someone to playing (catfishing) with others’ feelings.Your own analysis may be correct. Your parents didn’t provide a role model for how to manage anger or distress. They also didn’t provide you with the comfort and caring that kids need to internalize how to provide it to others. As a result, you are bouncing back and forth between the extremes, with little understanding of how to have balance in relationships.I very much doubt that you can change this on your own. You’ve had years of “practice” with the extremes with nothing to moderate it. For that reason, I encourage you to find a therapist who specializes in work with adolescents. A therapist can hear your whole history and can help you reconsider the conclusions you reached as a child. With therapeutic encouragement and support, you can learn a more balanced and meaningful way to relate to others.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 Thank you for writing us. I would find a way to arrange for him to have a physical. There are so many possibilities here — but at the core of this is we want to rule out any physical problems. Part of the physical would be to rule out if he has been using any drugs. Whenever there is a radical change in personality, a loss of interest in activities, excessive sleeping, lying and stealing money, one possibility is drug use is involved. I want to be clear about this. I’m not saying that drugs are the problem, but if I were taking a test in graduate school listing all the possible reasons, that would be one of them, and it would be close to the top of the list.

I feel as though I cannot communicate with anyone, it’s not that I do not want to…I can’t. I can’t think of anything to say to start a conversation, sometimes if I’m lucky ill get a conversation going but then random negative thoughts just come back into my head, I get flustered, and the conversation goes back to nothing and I am once again awkward. I mean the thoughts are negative don’t get me wrong but a lot of the time I spend trying to figure out what is wrong with me, evaluating myself. I know this is a main part of the problem but I can’t help it, I cant just stop the thoughts, they just happen. I was once the type of person who could talk to anyone, was friends with everyone, I had my main group of friends but if I wanted to could call up a random person I havn’t seen in a while and go hang out and just shoot the s**t I could, now if I tried to do that even with my close friends it is just awkward, I don’t know what the f**k is wrong with me, it kills me every day. All that I wish to do is have fun and be happy, but I can’t, something is restricting me completely.

 This problem is obviously causing you a great deal of distress. Ideally, it would be best to interview you in person. It seems as though you’re having difficulty communicating and concentrating. Was there a traumatic event, a medical illness, or a recent major change in your life that may be contributing to this problem? Did this change happen suddenly or is it something that developed gradually?It would be interesting to know if others have also noticed this change. I mention that because you are making judgments about your abilities that may be inaccurate. You may feel that you are not communicating well. Remember, feeling that something is true doesn’t mean it is true.I would recommend being evaluated by a mental health professional. The advantage of seeing a mental health professional is in receiving an objective assessment. A psychotherapist could also assist you in addressing your communication and concentration problems, analyze your interactions with others and provide relationship advice. You may also want to be evaluated by a physician to rule out a medical cause. The problem that you have described is less likely to be coming from a medical cause but it should still be evaluated by a physician. The doctor can also determine if medication would help with your symptoms. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

You are in your late 20s. You and your parents understand that you do not need their approval in choosing a partner. It is a testament to your love for them and your maturity that you want to calm their fears and reassure them that your choice is a good one. If you have known your boyfriend since you were very young, chances are your parents knew his family, too. There may be more to their concerns than they are sharing with you. I hope you will all remember that people do grow up and do learn from their own and others’ mistakes.I understand your parents’ concerns as I am sure you do. Arguing about your difference of opinion isn’t likely to be helpful. It will probably be much more helpful if you and your boyfriend sit down with your parents and have a calm and loving conversation with them. You might consider including the following points:At your age, it is unlikely that you will meet and love someone who has not been with others before you. Of more importance is what your boyfriend learned from his past and why he now believes he wants a life with you.The fact that his father was a philanderer is also a reasonable concern. Just as with the first objection, the question to ask is what he learned from his father’s behavior. Some men conclude that “real men” cheat. Others are horrified by their father’s behavior and vow to be different.The difference in profession is not necessarily a problem. The key is honesty. Have you and your boyfriend talked openly and honestly about the difference in your income potential and how you will handle it?If you and your boyfriend can’t imagine having such a conversation with your parents, then I think you do have a problem — but not with your parents. These are questions the two of you should be addressing with each other. Once you do, you will be in a much better position to decide if this man is right for you.I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

I’m in a serious relationship with a man who treats me great. We are currently long distance, seeing each other about once a month. At first I did not think much about his friends and the fact that a lot of them are girls. I have met quite a few of them and they are all beautiful and flirty. I don’t think they see him as more than a friend and he has never dated any of them as far as I know. However, he once in a while has one visit him at home to chat. He also has a lot of female friends on facebook. I feel that he is crossing a boundary with having girls at his place where he wants me to even move into. I don’t think he’s doing anything and he does tell me after, but sometimes he’s with them for a while and I feel like if he wants to socialize with women it should be in public, or involve me or someone else as well. I’m starting to get really nervous especially since he does women favors sometimes… I know he’s a nice person but why is he doing things for other women? I’m not sure where boundaries should be but I’m starting to get nervous. I don’t think be would cheat, but I also think there should be boundaries on closeness to prevent emotional cheating. Am I over thinking all of this? I struggle with my self esteem and I am not as pretty as these girls, also I need to be his main priority in life and the first person he shares things with etc. I don’t want to feel like the things he does for me he would also do for another woman. Or that another woman could have his attention as often as me. I feel that there should be a major difference in our relationship than how he is with other women, a difference more than the fact that we are intimate and that he is loving and mushy. Do I want too much?<|im_end|>

 Thank you very much for letting us read your email here at PsychCentral. I think there are various levels and ways in which to approach this, but they all include having an honest and direct conversation with him. The first way is to explain how important this is to you and the kind of feelings that are activated and that it feels like he crosses a boundary when he does it. Secondly, I would then explain that if he wants to continue, then this should be agreeable for you to do as well. In other words let him know that if he thinks it is okay for him, then it will have to be ok for you, too. If he feels it’s the right thing for him and he’s not willing to change — then he will have to be okay with you having male friends on Facebook, visiting their homes and doing favors for them as well.This is not a tit-for-tat but rather a reality check. You want to be in a mature relationship with an individual who thinks there’s reciprocity in your partnership, then he needs to know that what is good for him is good for you. This may be the beginning of an awakening in him, a change in how you choose to be in the relationship or a time for reevaluation.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From a teen in the U.S.: I;ve had a feeling for the past few months that something not right was going on with my mother, she was texting someone a lot, calling someone a lot, and leaving the house more often. But at around 11 o’clock last night i was talking to my mom in her room and i while we were talking she got a text from a guy from a home repair service we use,<|im_end|>

 This is devastating for any kid. You did the right thing to talk to your mother. She does need to talk to your father. A marriage is rarely improved when one of the partners has an affair. A marriage is often improved with counseling.At this point, all you can do is insist that your mom tell your dad. You should not have to hold a secret that is this painful to you. Tell your mom that it is just too hard for you to keep her secret when you know she is hurting the father you love. Go back to your original statement — that she needs to tell him or you will talk to him about your suspicions. If she suggests you will be to blame for ending the marriage, please don’t accept that idea. She is the one who is violating her marriage vows, not you.Then get out of it. The state of their marriage is up to them. Whatever happens between them, they can each still have a loving and honest relationship with you. Focus on your relationship with each of them and leave them to figure out what to do about their marriage.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

About 4 years ago my mom met a man after leaving an abusive husband. The man (her boyfriend now) has a son who is only a few months younger than me. Ever since we met the first time we clicked. We never intentionally did anything but it happened and we found ourselves falling for each other. I’ve had issues with trust and abandonment and he knew how to make me feel better without even knowing of my issues. We bring the best out in each other. (not that we haven’t had problems). Our relationship has grown over the years and I know for sure I’m in love and have no interest in anyone else. We’ve talked and he says he loves me as well and we have had a steady relationship since January. In most aspects we are an average couple except that no one knows about it other than us. (we’ve told friends we are in relationships, just not with each other)<|im_end|>

 What a lovely letter of your feelings and concern. No, it is not incest. Of course it is okay for you to continue with something that is so life affirming. The relationship your mother has with her boyfriend is not at all an impediment to your relationship right now. The definition of incest varies by culture and society, but is typically considered to be intercourse between blood relatives. The definition can be used to refer to individuals living under the same roof, and those related by adoption or marriage. But since there are no bloodline connections, and your mother and boyfriend are only dating, you would be on safe ground. What isn’t clear is if they are living together or not. If they are, the struggle would be with the perception of others. If your parents don’t know about it the two of you should decide together if you want to tell them.It is a wonderful thing to find someone who understands you at a level that makes you feel loved and safe. I would encourage you to follow your hearts.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

There are moments in my day that I’ll completely stop what I’m doing and have a flashback for maybe a max of 5 seconds. I’ll just stand there, blank and motionless. I can feel myself doing it, it just takes me a second to snap myself out of it — (this is not the case when I’m not focused on something, situations where I’m watching a movie or in the shower I find myself fall into this blank empty feeling, I’m not sure how much time passes before i snap myself back into reality). The flashbacks can be something that happened 10 minutes ago or 10 years ago. They can be upsetting or happy. For example, they can be as intense as remembering crying when my grandmother passed away, or as meaningless as remembering mopping the floor at work. When these flashbacks happen i feel like for that moment I’m no longer in reality, it’s as if I’m living in the memory. Once the short few seconds are over I can go right back to my task as if it never happened.<|im_end|>

 You’re noting this as a potential problem and it may be, but I don’t have enough information to know what might be wrong. I would recommend keeping track of these experiences. You should note the following about your flashbacks: when they occur (i.e. time of day), your location (i.e. work, home, etc.) and what you’re doing (i.e. just waking up, immediately upon standing, etc.), whether you are highly stressed, whether you haven’t slept well, their content, and how long they last.Perhaps do this for about a month and then analyze your data. Do you see any patterns? How often do they occur over the course of the month? This information might help you to better understand the flashbacks. Over time, you may notice a pattern developing. Having these records would also be highly beneficial to a health care or mental health professional.Documenting the flashbacks are a good idea but it would be more helpful to discuss your concerns with your primary care doctor. He or she can gather more information about these experiences and determine if treatment is necessary. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Last year my husband said he knew this girl who needed our help. She had what appeared to be an abusive boyfriend. My husband wanted to help this girl, and I agreed- why not help a person who needs some support. However, soon I became excluded from the help. That is,my husband was the main one interacting with her. He would send emails, meet, exchanged gifts- I was NEVER allowed to be apart of this. My husband was acting like he was having an affair. He was lying to me. He was buying secret phones to call this “girl”. He insulted me,said things to me that one would not even say to their worst enemy. Once he had to go to the hospital. He gave me instructions for taking care of his mother, brother, daughter,and this girl- no parting words for me. The painful examples can go on and on.<|im_end|>

 Yes, your feelings are quite normal. What you are feeling is typical of the person in a relationship who has been betrayed. Your husband knew all along what he was doing. You, on the other hand, had no say in the situation. That lack of control makes most people feel devalued, upset, anxious and depressed. Since your husband was letting you have almost no impact, your only choices were to either leave or wait it out. Neither is a happy position to be in.I’m glad that you are able to be more yourself at work. That’s an important affirmation that you are okay and that you have it in you to get beyond the sadness. But your relationship with your husband needs some major repair work. He is either clueless or he is hoping that if he acts as if everything is the same, he won’t have to deal with either guilt or your justifiable anger. I suggest you make an appointment with a couples counselor. Go even if your husband won’t. Once he sees you are serious, he may join you later. But in the meantime, you would have a place to deal with your feelings and to make some decisions about how you want to respond to the events of the past 6 months.You are not crazy. You are hurt. You deserve to have some support from an experienced professional who can help you make sense of the situation.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

When I was a kid, a friend and I would pretend to be super heroes and play around. Since then this behavior has stuck with me, and I constantly find myself pretending to be someone else– usually someone made up. I always do this alone, and have full conversations and relationships in my head. In real life I have no friends. I started being homeschooled at the end of 10th grade, because the school in my area was terrible. I’m extremely social online, just not in real life. Most days I stay in the house, along with what I described. I’ve always wondered if doing this means there’s something wrong with me. I often rationalize it as an escape from my life, but I can only use that excuse so much without knowing if it is just that– an excuse. Any advice would be appreciated.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
This is a difficult question to answer without knowing more personal information about you. The problem is complex because given your current situation, it doesn’t seem to be hurting you. In fact, it seems to be helping you.You interact with others online. Perhaps you have adapted to your particular situation (i.e. having to be homeschooled because of a problematic school environment) and are doing just fine.Alternatively, if these conversations and relationships you have described, are prohibiting you from developing meaningful relationships, then that is problematic. In other words, if you are choosing to be solitary because of fear or social anxiety, that is unhealthy.Generally speaking, humans are social beings. They want to be around other people. Research suggests that being in the physical presence of others and having developed close relationships are essential components of healthy psychological development. Social isolation is generally a sign that something is wrong.Excessive use of social networking sites among young people is associated with loneliness, anxiety and depression. Virtual relationships are not suitable replacements for the more traditional, non-virtual relationships.Ultimately, the reason why you do something matters. In other words, what is your motivation? Are you choosing physical isolation because you have more important things to do or is it out of fear?I would recommend consulting a therapist to determine if a problem is present. It’s always best to be proactive when it comes to one’s mental health. Good luck and please take care.<|im_end|>"

I’m 34, Chinese-German woman who just moved to Prague with my husband and two sons (age 2 and 4). We moved after my nervous breakdown of sorts. My husband got a good job here so i dont have to work and can focus on getting better. I had been working full-time in an extremely stressful job as well as looking after the children. I returned to work within a few months of each birth, despite being complicated and difficult birth of 2nd son and the sudden death of my mother when he was only a few months old. My husband was away traveling and I didn’t get to grieve properly.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Generally, what you are saying is that you do not feel well emotionally. You suggest that the cause may be how you were treated as a child, how your mother was treated when you were a child, the inability to grieve after your mother’s death, Chinese cultural values and the way your husband makes you feel when he has an angry outburst.It may not be any one of those things but it could be a combination of all of those things. You asked specifically what type of therapy would be best. I doubt that anyone could accurately answer your question. I don’t mean to evade your question and I certainly will make some suggestions as to the right therapist, but not as to the right therapy.If you are right and these problems originated in childhood, then you should expect a longer-term therapy than a shorter-term therapy. How do you know which therapy is effective? You will not know which therapy is effective but you will most certainly know if your therapist is being effective. How? You should be feeling slightly better after every therapy session. It may be hard to notice week by week but it should be more easily noticed month by month. After every therapy session, you should notice an insight into your problem and that insight should leave you with a positive feeling.If you apply a cream for a rash on your hand, it is reasonable to expect that rash to get better over time. If it does not get better, then the medicine is ineffective and you must try another. The practitioner, physician or therapist, will use their judgment and professional training to select the particular type of treatment. It is not your job to go to your physician and tell him which medicine you want him to prescribe. The practitioner will use their education and training to choose what they believe will be the right treatment. It will be your job to judge the effectiveness of your practitioner’s treatment.No one will know better than you if the treatment that you are receiving is helping. If one practitioner is being ineffective, in their treatment, don’t give up on all practitioners. Try one after the other, until you find one that is being effective in treating your problems. If you meet a practitioner for the first time and you leave that meeting with a negative feeling, don’t go back. Try another practitioner.Psychological research shows that often the most effective type of practitioner for a person is not based upon their practitioners training but is instead based upon something much simpler; how well they liked their practitioner or in other words how strong were the positive feelings they had after interacting with their practitioner.Your therapy may be measured in weeks, months or even years. But don’t think that you have to wait weeks or months or years to feel better. You should feel somewhat better after every therapy session. Feeling the way you do is simply not good enough. You deserve to be happy and there is no reason that you cannot feel that way. No matter what the original causes of your unhappiness, you can choose the path to happiness. Therapy is that path. You can contemplate that path but at some point, you will have to begin to walk that path. The choice is yours but your happiness is only achievable by taking the first step and then continuing to its end. I hope I’ve been of some help. Good luck on your decision.<|im_end|>"

So to start off my mom and I didn’t always have a terrible relationship. I think things started changing when I started, well, gaining weight. I was becoming fat and she used to scream at me for it. In the beginning, whenever she did call me fat and ugly she apologized later and this continued till I was like 13. She did hit me with a rolling pin or her hands and I used to be so scared to walk past her when she was in a bad mood cause I was afraid she’d hit me if I was in her reach. I remember this one time I was on the ground and she was kicking me and just kept going. Then as the teen years went by I was in that typical unreasonable stage where at one point I told her I hated her which got me a quick beating. When I finally passed that stage when I was 17 and I didn’t get beatings anymore. I also started making effort to drop the weight however she never tried to support me, like she’d pay for the gym, she’d push me everyday but the moment she was in a bad mood she’d call me a fat and useless daughter, which really hurt my feelings cause I was genuinely trying to lose weight. She told me everyday if I kept being fat I’d get bullied and in my mind I always felt like she was my only bully. Every time i spoke to her, she’d sort of look at me in disgust and say, “Go away I don’t really need to look at somebody who looks like an elephant at this time of the day” or she’d call me a useful lump or something like that. She is slim and beautiful, of course. I stay locked in my room because I know if I come out and have a conversation it would turn to the topic of my weight and end in a fight.  She has a problem with that as well and has called me dull countless times.<|im_end|>

I had been seeing my therapist for 2 and a half years. Last week she dropped a bombshell on me and told me she couldn’t be my therapist anymore because she didn’t feel like she could help me with my OCD. She said it would be unethical to continue with me since she has no knowledge on how to treat OCD. Yesterday was our last appointment. She gave me her email a while back and said I could email her whenever I want. She told me not to email her anymore. I also asked if she was going to not see her other OCD patients anymore and she said she would still see them.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 She left you little choice in the matter. She ended the relationship and in all likelihood would not respond to your requests. You may have no choice but to find a new therapist.Ethically, if what you say is correct, then your therapist did not handle this matter well. Termination of psychotherapy is an important aspect in the training of a psychotherapist.Psychotherapists are ethically bound to protect their clients from harm. Generally speaking, it would be appropriate for her to terminate the therapeutic relationship if she were unable to provide the appropriate level of clinical treatment.However, that is not what seemingly happened in this case. Her stated reason for ending the relationship was because she didn’t have the knowledge to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder yet was still willing to treat other patients with this disorder.In that case, she may have been guilty of abandonment, which is the “inappropriate termination of therapy.”Please keep in mind that I cannot definitively determine if your therapist is guilty of abandonment because I only have a very limited set of facts but it is possible. There are many highly qualified therapists who would be very happy to have you as a client. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My parents are in their 50’s and have begun hoarding stuff and their quality of life is greatly diminished. They have raccoons living in the attic, there are open holes in the side of the house, both have collected things beyond what can healthfully fit in their space, they have 8 cats and some other little things I am concerned about. The house is a constant mess because they can’t keep up with maintenance and general cleaning. I do know they realize that some things need to change, like plugging holes in the house that raccoons are getting in but when i offer help or suggestions they are super sensitive or just say “i know, but”. There is always an excuse or reason they have not gotten to it yet. I live across the country and can’t physically help around the house.

 I would rather see you deal with this directly now rather than wait until something catastrophic comes along. My guess is that the county they live in has social services. So the first thing you would want to do is find out who could do a home visit. Different states have various agencies that may be able to help. The first call would be to the local community hospital nearest their home, and ask to speak to someone who is in the social work department. Brainstorming with these folks is an excellent way to zero in on what agencies and services can be available. Once you find the right agency — they will better be able to help you plan.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I’m 20 years old and have been with my boyfriend for about 4 months. We started at the beginning of the spring semester after Winter Break. During Winter Break I had told my parents about him and that he had bipolar disorder and some other personal things about his life. They told me to stay away because I didn’t need that kind of crazy in my life, and I, striving to be the perfect daughter, told them that I didn’t like him anyway, even though I did. I just didn’t want to cause any waves.<|im_end|>

 What a difficult, difficult situation. I understand that your parents believe they are acting out of love for you. They don’t want to see you getting more deeply involved in a romance that could lead to heartbreak. What they don’t understand is that a mental health diagnosis, especially when well-treated, doesn’t have to lead to all the dire things they think it will. Sadly, their fears have led them to say some very hurtful things to you. Do see it as their fear talking. What they are saying is not necessarily what they really believe.At 20, you are no longer a kid who only has two choices: Go along with your folks or be defiant. You have a third choice: You can do your best to keep your head and to respond more maturely than your parents are able to. Explain to them, gently, that they did not raise someone who can’t be rational. Let them know that you understand their fears for you and appreciate the loving intentions. Let them know what you told me: That your boyfriend is taking charge of his illness, that he is on medication and that his prognosis is good. Ask them for their respect and support as you explore for yourself whether this is the relationship for you.Do not get angry. Anger will only prove to them that you are an immature child who needs their protection. Stay calm and loving and give them some time. If that doesn’t prove effective, you have some hard choices to make. You are an adult and are entitled to make your own decisions. However, I suspect that your parents are helping you fund your education. That complicates things for you. Only you can decide what sacrifices you are willing to make to keep this man in your life. I hope it doesn’t come to that. I hope you can appeal to your folks to trust that they raised you well and that you can make healthy decisions.I wish you well <|im_end|>"

He asked if he could use my cell phone to call his phone company to activate his new phone…otherwise he would not have one. So as long as he was civil I could be too.

Since I can remember I have had horrible anxiety when it came to change and social interactions. On top of that I would experience horrible mood swings, from feeling like I was a superstar to feeling so sad and hopeless I wanted to die! I have been on many different anti-depressants and anxiety drugs. I have always felt out of place and had few, if any, friends. As a kid I would fake being sick so I didn’t have to go to school, if I had to do a presentation in front of the class I would pretend I was sick or hurt to go home to get out of it, as I got older, like high school I would go hide in the rest room until that class was over so I didn’t have to be in front of the class. In my adult life I have hid in a rest room at work so I didn’t have to give out an award in front of a 100 people! I have walked off jobs because I was to scared to walk through the door.<|im_end|>

 Anxiety has plagued you since childhood. It continues to be a problem, most likely because it has never been properly treated. You feel as though the problem has become worse over time. It seems as though it has. Avoiding or fleeing anxiety-producing situations reinforces an anxiety problem and will increase future anxiety, in most cases. It temporarily provides relief but in the long run, it makes it worse.There are very effective treatments that exist for anxiety and panic. Two of the best are (1) cognitive behavioral therapy and (2) exposure and response prevention therapy. Both are very good but they cannot work if you quit therapy prematurely.The key to overcoming anxiety is to resist the urge to flee a situation when you feel anxious. Your desire to flee a situation is understandable in the face of severe anxiety but it is this very behavior that reinforces the anxiety. Resisting this urge to flee and enduring anxiety are the only true ways to solve this problem.It is important to understand the nature of anxiety. It can increase to very high levels but it can only reach a maximum. It will eventually peak and then decrease. Part of exposure and prevention response therapy is encouraging the client to endure all of the stages of anxiety, from the most intense periods to its ultimate decrease. Exposure and prevention response therapy would essentially force you to face your fears in a systematic and controlled environment.Force yourself to attend therapy even if it makes you uncomfortable and anxious. It may be unpleasant but it is a cure. Anxiety does not have to be a crippling or lifelong problem.My suggestion is to find a therapist who specializes in treating anxiety disorders. Also consider a therapist who specializes in exposure and response prevention therapy. For those who are willing to undergo this type of therapy, the success rates are very high. A Psych Central blogger recently posted about her experience.Psychotropic medications can help to decrease your anxiety while undergoing therapy. You have tried several medications and they have not worked but that is not an uncommon beginning. You should continue to work with your prescribing physician and continue to search for one, or a combination of several, medications that will provide relief. Remember, relief is not a cure but merely a means to manage symptoms.Unfortunately, if this problem is left untreated it will very likely worsen. This is often the nature of an untreated anxiety disorder. The find help tab, at the top of this page, can help you locate a therapist in your community. I wish you the best. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Anyone who asks whether they need help already has the answer. You are smart enough to know that what is going on with you isn’t “normal” and that if it continues you will be in real trouble. I think that maybe you are not so much depressed as scared. If we were talking, I’d want to know how you are handling the entry into high school and the expectations that go with it.The teen years can be very, very difficult, especially for sensitive people like you. Although it may feel that way, I assure you that you are not at all alone in being unsure and upset.Please talk to your parents about how much difficulty you are having fitting in and finding your way. A few sessions with a counselor who specializes in adolescence will give you some new tools for coping with challenges and the reassurance you need to navigate the teen years.I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

My son is now 13 and had been diagnosed ED / ADHD since he was 3.  I was a single mom the first 4 years of his life, and married when he was four.  I now have two other boys, 2 and 4, and my husband and I are struggling to deal with the oldest’s behaviors.  It is actually causing me to be very depressed at times and it is straining our marriage.  I’m not sure what I can do, to help him and us.  I feel like I’m going to literally lose my mind on a daily basis. I end up snapping at everyone or not dealing with normal issues, because I feel so overwhelmed.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Thanks for reaching out for help. You’ve hung in there a long time with your son’s illness and it sounds like it’s wearing you down emotionally. I’m glad to know that your son is in therapy, and from what you’re describing, it sounds like it is time for you to get some help.  I suggest specifically being assessed for depression and anxiety. The irritability, overwhelming feelings, and fears you’re describing deserve attention and treatment. It’s common for parents of children with chronic mental health issues to feel discouraged, down, overwhelmed, and scared.  It’s also common to feel isolated, alone, and helpless.After seeking support for you, I recommend accessing  additional help for you and your family. Since you already have a relationship with your son’s therapist, he or she may be an excellent referral source for additional support services. Have you discussed with your son’s therapist your need for specific skills to manage your son’s behavior, or requested to include the family in the treatment process?  If your son’s therapist isn’t comfortable with family therapy, ask if there are any recommended colleagues who work with marriage and family issues. Also, ask your son’s therapists for book recommendations about your son’s specific struggles. If you haven’t already done so, it may be helpful to read about your son’s illnesses, and encourage your husband to do the same. Gaining more understanding about what your son is going through may help you frame his illness in a more manageable way, help you less overwhelmed, and help you feel more prepared to support him.Check with your local school district about parenting classes and support groups for children and families with ADHD and other behavior problems. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by my suggestions, ask your husband to help you research additional services to help your family during this time of crisis.Take good care of you and yours!

I’ve been having problems lately with pedophilia. I’ve never had these problems before until now. What I mean is that I felt sexually attracted to girls around 12 years old or at least looked like that. They did not look like prepubescent children.<|im_end|>

 As a 15-year-old teenage boy I appreciate your sensitivity, concern, and awareness. However, rather then identifying your reaction in a diagnostic way, I think it is best to store with what we know is absolutely true: you are not comfortable with these thoughts.The anxiety you feel and concern is what needs to be sorted through. I would recommend two things. First I would find a trusted adult, perhaps a teacher in your school, that you can talk to about his concerns. Secondly, I would recommend using our forums here, they will allow you to talk about these feelings with others who struggle with them.Finally, it would certainly be appropriate for you to talk to your physician the next time you go to the doctor. Physicians who work with teenagers are familiar with the kinds of concerns you have.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I’ve had anxiety attacks since middle school. I have no idea why. I could be having the most amazing time and I could break down. I’ve also had some suicidal thoughts. It happened in the end of eighth grade then stopped then now they come and go. I want to tell my mom I want help with it but she’ll say she can help cause she’s a psychiatrist but I want someone else but I don’t know how to tell her I want actual help from someone I don’t know. My anxiety takes over my times I’m having fun or times I’m trying to sleep. I never know when it will happen or why.<|im_end|>

 You are assuming that your mother will suggest that she act as your therapist but perhaps not. Most mental health professionals recognize the problems inherent with treating family members. In fact, licensing boards have developed a code of ethics that professionals are obligated to follow.The American Medical Association, an organization of which your mother might be a member, writes the following about this matter:<|im_end|>"

I have been experiencing alot things in my life that are negative.. like i use to be a person who was down to earth and fun to be around with but all of that has changed.. i have only one best friend but i dont want to drag her down with this problem i have.. I get very nervous and i sweat alot when i am around alot of ppl and i tend to feel dizzy and not able to be myself. I have been really quiet lately and have declined alot of hangouts with my friends and have been staying at home. I usually get a feeling of emptiness inside of me everyday.. and i would sometimes think alot and my mind would go crazy.. i cant focus, i work fulltime in the summer to keep me busy.. i feel paranoid and ppl always talk crud about me behind my back or make fun of me.. i think i have low self esteem and confidence, and few times in life where i wanted to attempt suicide but didnt go through with it cuz it would be a coward move.. i just want to know whats wrong with me so i can pull my life back together, i was never like this before its like my life turned upside down. I admit its been a year since my last relationship and things that go on with my friends nowadays make me not trust anyone too.. srry for my bad grammer.<|im_end|>

 It is difficult to determine with certainty what diagnosis you have. My limited assessment of your situation is that you have symptoms of anxiety and depression. On some occasions you feel very nervous, begin to sweat and experience dizziness. You might have experienced a panic attack. Generally speaking, these symptoms are consistent with an anxiety disorder and possibly, panic disorder.In an effort to escape feeling anxious, you avoid interacting with others. This is a mistake. That may seem counterintuitive but the avoidance of anxiety-producing situations will ultimately increase your anxiety. Combating anxiety requires that individuals force themselves to endure it and not avoid situations in which it might arise. I understand this might be hard but it is the most effective approach to eliminating anxiety.Your symptoms of depression include: feeling of emptiness, inability to focus, low self-esteem and confidence, and a history of a suicide attempt. Anytime an individual gets to the point where they have contemplated suicide, it is a very serious matter. You should strongly consider treatment.I would encourage you to have a psychiatric evaluation. It could help to determine if you have a diagnosable disorder. In addition, you should consider psychotherapy or medication. These issues might be difficult to solve on your own and may require the assistance of a trained mental health professional.

My husband lost his second job in 4 years last Oct/Nov. He never really helped with the house or the two younger kids, 10 and 7, before he lost his job and always spent extravegently. But with him being off work for so long this time I hoped he would have made some effort to help out, especially since we are about to have a fourth child and I have started to have to work over time to make ends meet, and at least stop spending the way he does. So far in the last year he has went to Florida twice, Colorado once (where he took in a baseball game, rented three cars- two at $400 a day to four wheel and one just to drive around), and Indianapolis (where he went to the Indianapolis 500). He is shopping constantly, spending 1000’s on fixing his numorous cars, spending at least two nights a week at bars with friends (where I usually have to come pick him up), and spending 100’s a month on his daughter, 15. Since I am working over time he has been left in charge of our two younger girls at night and homework is not getting done, he doesn’t feed them dinner (I do ususally around 8:30-9), the kids are constantly calling me at work after school because he is watching TV in his room and refuses to make himself avaliable to them. The house is a complete disaster as well.<|im_end|>

 Your husband is in serious denial and so are you. He’s pretending he doesn’t have responsibilities as a husband and father. You are pretending that you can keep your financial boat afloat by throwing money at the situation. It isn’t working. It’s as if you are trying to fill a pitcher that has a hole in the bottom. Of even more concern is that you are in denial about the care your children are getting from him. This isn’t a safe or healthy situation for them.I absolutely sympathize with the stress that unemployment can put on a guy. But the answer is not to sink the family. He could be giving you the emotional and practical support you need to provide for the family. Yes, it is a reversal of the traditional roles. But having one parent at home and one parent providing is a model that women have accepted and done well for generations and more and more men are embracing. It’s a model that can and does work. If he can’t find a job, your husband needs to do the job of taking care of the house and children so that you can perform well. As many, many men and women can tell him, that can be as rewarding and dignfying as any employment.Your husband is too depressed to make a change so it’s up to you. For the sake of all your children, including the baby to come, separate your money. The money your husband has wasted could have gone to good childcare and some household help. Give him a modest allowance but that’s it, no exceptions, until he becomes a solid contributing partner. Make sure you are not responsible for any credit cards he has in his possession. You may need to see a lawyer to make sure you are not left holding the bag if he defaults on his financial obligations. Demand that your husband get into serious treatment, take his medications, and put himself on a money diet. He should probably sell some of the cars and stay out of the bars. Without money, he won’t be able to escape the reality that he is in serious trouble. When you stop cooperating with his denial, he’ll be less able to keep up the pretense of being among the privileged rich.If your husband can’t or won’t man up, you have difficult decisions to make. Your first obligation is to the safety and welfare of your kids.I realize that it’s terribly hard to make ultimatums to someone you love. But without a cold splash of reality, there is no reason for your husband to change. Wake up and get busy. Your new baby as well as your older kids deserve to have a more relaxed mom and a more responsible dad.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 Your stepdad crossed an important boundary. The “incest taboo” exists to protect young people and their older relatives from making a psychologically dangerous mistake for them both. For some men, living with an attractive young woman, especially a young woman who is not biologically related to them, is very challenging. Their sense goes out the window when their body responds to the attraction. Some stepdads and even some dads distance themselves from their teenaged daughters because it’s the only way they know to keep the girl and themselves safe. When that happens, it’s often very confusing to a girl who has been daddy’s little girl to have her father start to act cold and aloof. It’s a sad solution for them both.To your stepdad’s credit, he stopped when you told him to and apologized without prompting from someone else. It sounds like he fully understands that what he did was wrong. He did not make excuses. He did not swear you to secrecy. He is appropriately ashamed of himself. I’m not saying that this makes what he did okay. It’s not. But it does sound like you can repair the relationship if you want to. Up until now he’s been a good dad to you so it’s maybe worth a try.I do think you should tell your stepdad that he needs to tell your mother what he did. Then the three of you need to have a discussion about how to live together safely. If he is truly ashamed of himself and asks for forgiveness, you – and your mother – could decide to give him a chance. Only the two of you know if he has enough good qualities to balance out a serious slip in judgment.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

When my boyfriend and I started dating, things were wonderful. He accepted me for “me”, was non-judgmental, etc. One day he asked about my past. He had been married for most of his adult life, whereas I have never been married. I proceeded to tell him that I went to clubs from time to time when I was younger. He asked about my sexual past. I was honest and answered truthfully. He then began pulling away…saying I purposefully kept this from him. We broke up and got back together 3 times. Anytime he asks about it, I answer truthfully again. I have nothing to hide. Each time we have gotten back together, it has been better, but not anywhere near where it should be. He still believes I purposefully withheld this information, when in reality, I had never dated anyone that really cared about my past, so I didn’t think to share it. This situation has been a wall between us since we got together. I have done everything I know to do to reassure him and to help reestablish trust. This morning he tells me I haven’t done anything to make him believe in me. I feel like I have been busting my hump (so to speak), but at this point I don’t know what to do. Please help…how can I prove that I was telling the truth those months ago so we can be the couple we are more than capable of being?<|im_end|>

 I am sorry you are going through this so often with your boyfriend. My experience has been that this type of response, pulling away because of your partner’s past, is a cover for something else.Offer to go to couples therapy with him. I highly recommend working together to sort this through. I believe that this is your best effort in keeping the relationship. It can help get to the bottom of it.But, if he is unwilling to go with you I wouldn’t waste much time trying to convince him. If he can’t see the good person that’s in front of him right now, he can always use the past to break it off — and you deserve better than that.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

For example, holding objects so that they touch the center of my palm and breathing in deeper than usual (I’ve described this to others as breathing in until it ‘clicks’, almost like yawning but intentionally). These things make me feel good/ satisfied but only for a second or so which makes me want to repeat them or distract myself.<|im_end|>

My son in law has Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome and after a period of remission he has gotten worse. He and my daughter live 2 hours away. I have noticed that my daughter seems more stressed and flat and she has seemed to have distanced herself from the family. I have asked her many time if there is a problem other than the vomiting disorder and she has said no. I visited her last weekend but was asked to stay at a motel. She came to visit me at my motel early one morning and told me the truth. Her husband has been diagnosed with bi polar disorder, she said he is a rapid cycler, has had psychotic episodes, hallucinations and black outs. He is very irriatble and verbally abusive to her. He has up till now now allowed her to tell anyone. As a result she is having panic attachs which her counselor said were PTSD. She said he also suffers from paranoia and extremely low self esteem. She said he has not gotten physically violent yet but she thought he was close at one point. They have 2 daughters 6 and 12. My daughter has had to explain to the older girl. My son in law is being treated but the drug that seemed to help affected his liver and he has trouble keeping drugs down because of the vomiting disorder. I have suspected hostile behavior on his part for over a year. After getting upset with me last year he walked out of the house, later that night I found that my car had been keyed. He owns many guns. My daughter has made me promise not to tell anyone. I am wondering if I need to be concerned about the safety of my daughter and granddaughters and if so, what would be the best way to deal with the situation.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Yes, I do believe that it is reasonable to be concerned about the safety of your daughter and your granddaughters. Your daughter reported that she is experiencing verbal abuse. She’s also very fearful of her husband. He has prohibited her from even speaking about his behavior and what goes on in the home.Additionally, there are other concerning factors. These include the fact that he has a serious mental illness, which because of a health problem cannot be adequately medicated. This means that her husband is actively symptomatic. In addition, he is a “rapid cycler,” psychotic, easily agitated and irritable. He has a history of blackouts. These could be linked to his medical problems, psychosis or to his anger episodes. He also owns guns and has come close to physically harming your daughter. It is possible that he has already physically harmed your daughter but she is reluctant to tell you. Research has shown that family members are often the target in cases where violence occurs. Finally, while he has not physically harmed you, he has vandalized your vehicle. These are all major red flags associated with the potential for violence.Simply having bipolar disorder does not make an individual more likely to be violent than an individual without bipolar disorder. What primarily increases the risk for violence is an untreated psychotic disorder.Your next question is what should your daughter do about this situation. That is a difficult question to answer. Below I will list several suggestions.You said she has a therapist. She should ask for his or her advice. If you believe that your daughter is less than forthcoming about this situation with her therapist, then call him or her and report what you know. The therapist, due to confidentiality laws, cannot reveal information about your daughter’s case to you but there is no law against you providing information to the therapist.She could also do several other things. You mentioned that her husband is unable to digest or sufficiently consume his medication because of a medical problem. This tells me that he has a psychiatrist or has at least has been in recent contact with mental health professionals. Your daughter could report his behavior to his doctor or treatment team. They may be able to advise your daughter about how to handle this situation.Other ideas include calling the police or mental health crisis team if his behavior is out of control. If he is actively psychotic and threatening her, he would likely be admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Calling the police or the mental health crisis team can expedite the process of hospital admission.The safest and most appropriate way to proceed, given the current circumstances, is for your daughter and your grandchildren to move out of the home until his symptoms are under control. Domestic violence shelters can provide a temporary safe house. It is a very volatile situation and your daughter and your grandchildren need to be protected.My final recommendation is to review the Treatment Advocacy Center website. They provide information to family members dealing with psychiatric crisis situations. They also provide a great deal of other educational information that I believe you and your daughter would find relevant and beneficial.I hope this helps. Please take care and don’t hesitate to write again if you have additional questions.<|im_end|>"

 I’m so, so sorry you’ve been mistreated and bullied. But you know what? You are letting the bullies win! They’ve got you so scared and discouraged that you are isolating yourself. You are also depending too much on this one relationship to give you everything you need. Of course you fight. Deep inside you think she’ll turn on you too. Sadly, the way you are acting, you are going to create exactly what you fear. At some point, she’s going to have had enough of your accusations and arguments. I’m so glad you wrote before it got too late.One of my favorite quotations is this: “Living well is the best revenge.” The best way to get even with the bullies is for you to develop self-confidence and to walk in the world with your head held high. You need to let them know that they can’t touch you. Instead of fighting with your girlfriend, talk with her about how the two of you can give yourselves an emotional make-over. What do the two of you need to do to feel pretty and self-assured? How can the two of you find some other friends who are fun to be with? How can you support each other and reassure each other? Make it a project. You both deserve a better life.If you can’t do it on your own, then please consider seeing a counselor to give you some help while you work on it. A counselor can give you both practical advice and support.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 A boy who isn’t mature enough to talk to you himself about wanting to just be friends isn’t mature enough to be going out with anyone. To his credit, he knew he should slow down. Now you should too.

 Your husband is more interested in being a good son than in being a good husband. Marriage usually means leaving our childhood family and starting a family of our own. That means shifting our loyalty and priorities to our marriage. Yes, it’s important to honor our parents and to help out when we can. But marriage is about making a new beginning. That means investing time and money and energy and love in the couple. In healthy families, the parents give their blessing and support for this change.I fully understand wanting to help parents who are financially in need if a couple can. I don’t understand a husband who buys expensive jewelry for his parents but doesn’t take responsibility for at least half the bills at home. I sympathize with your disappointment and pain that your husband was more interested in buying jewelry for his mother than in paying the hospital bill. You were probably grieving the loss of a child. You needed the love and support of your husband.From all you said, I don’t think your husband wants to change. He himself told you that you need to accept the current situation or leave. My suggestion is that you leave. You are already taking care of both of you so you do have the money to take care of yourself. I don’t see anything to keep you in this relationship except the fact that you care more about him than he cares about you.You deserve better. As difficult as it may be, send this guy back to his mother. Make yourself available for someone who loves you and cherishes you and sees you as important in his life.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Absolutely keep the appointment with the lawyer. Your husband is a repeat offender. He apparently hasn’t learned a thing from two prior failed marriages.I doubt this all started due to his first wife’s infidelity. As you pointed out, there was probably something wrong in that relationship already. Frankly, it doesn’t matter where it started. He has continued his abusive behavior with each wife.There must be something charming about your husband on the surface at least. He has convinced 3 women to marry him. But please don’t be distracted by his charms. The real guy is the angry guy who calls you names and is generally emotionally abusive. Love isn’t like that. No one should be treated that way.Get out of this marriage and make it possible to find someone who will love you and cherish you as you deserve.I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

 You have a right to be nervous about whether this relationship will last. You and your boyfriend have very different ideas about what it means to be in a relationship. If you don’t settle your disagreement about what is and isn’t okay, the two of you will be constantly struggling with each other and monitoring each other.The primary “rules” for any relationship is what the two people involved decide should be the “rules.” Negotiating that agreement is part of what moves a relationship forward. You and your boyfriend haven’t done that important piece of relationship work.It’s not for me to say how your relationship should be. As a therapist, I can tell you that it is important that the two of you work through your disagreement to something you are both comfortable honoring. The process will not only solve this problem but will set a standard for how you will manage other disagreements that come along.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I’m 16 years old and for about three years now I have been really depressed. I have self-harmed quite a bit, and now have a lot of trouble sleeping. I am constantly arguing with my family, and have real problems when it comes to friendships. I like to keep myself to myself, and mostly because I have been bullied for the past five years of my life. I feel really isolated and secluded from anybody, and am constantly finding it hard to cope with minimal friendships. I find it terribly difficult to talk to anybody about how I feel because I hate to have attention. I am just trying so hard to cope, but nearly every day I break down. No one knows, because I keep myself to myself. I have a lot of trouble showing my emotions and people see me as a careless, selfish person. I really don’t think I am a good person, however I know it’s all in my head. I hate talking about myself because I do not want anyone to guess what is wrong with me, although I really want to tell someone. I constantly feel hopeless and even more helpless, ever on the brink of self-harming. I seem to have no control over my emotions, and can explode at anyone, although it seems to always be a family member. I just feel no one understands me and I really want to know how to deal with my problem. I hate living with these feelings, but I can’t help myself. I do sometimes just want to die, and I honestly believe that no one will care, as I have next to no friends and I feel that my family doesn’t like me.

 It sounds as if your daughter has a variety of rich and intense experiences, some of which are problematic. The nature of this is such that you may want to get a consult with a child psychologist or psychiatrist to talk and evaluate her about these experiences. The psychiatrist or child psychologist, particularly if he or she has a lot of experience, can help sort through these happenings and give you some feedback about next steps.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

My whole life I have been told by teachers and everything that I have ADD. I was always in trouble, failing stuff, talked to much, made noise and never could sit still. I even always had reading comprehension problems. My teachers even tried to tell my mom but I have a mother that doesn’t believe in it. Now i’m in college and still having almost all the same problems. I’ve Always been the kid that thinks there listening but is tapping there pencil staring out the window or moving my feet around which makes people around you mad. It takes me forever to read something i even have to read the questions close before i tAke it in. Im a good reader it’s just like my mind doesn’t know what it just read. I don’t know how to explain it. I want to be a teacher so bad but Im still having problems at school now I’m on academic probation. I still am close to one of my teachers I had all threw high school and she still tells me she thinks I have that. Im very impulsive and always full of energy Ive even had a run in wihh the law. Does this sound consistent to ADD to you?? Im at my witts end and really wanna suceed And dont know what to do..<|im_end|>

 It must be terribly frustrating to know what you want to do academically but feel so helpless to do it. You know you are smart enough to do well in school but something keeps getting in your way. I’m not sure if the problem is ADHD. What you describe could be accounted for by any number of learning disabilities as well as by an impulse control disorder. You absolutely need to get an accurate diagnosis.Most colleges these days have a counseling service available for their students. You can get some testing there to help you understand just what the problem is. Your parents don’t have to know about it unless you want them to. Once you have been evaluated, you and the counselors will then have a solid basis for developing a plan to help you manage school. It’s also possible that you will need some accomodations to help you do your very best.There are lots and lots of smart kids who have learning differences that make it difficult for them to be successful in school. Being able to sit quietly for long periods of time, to change subjects at arbitrary times, to focus on several different subjects every day, to take timed tests, etc. may be the traditional demands of American schools but they are not necessarily reflective of someone’s intelligence or abilities. Let’s face it. You’ll never have to do things like that once you get out into the work world. Even teachers get to walk around and to change things up a little when they get restless.I hope you will take steps to learn more about your own learning style and how to use it. Then I also hope you will stick with your goal of becoming a teacher. Too often kids with undiagnosed learning differences decide they are stupid and develop terrible self-esteem. We need more educators who understand that being different doesn’t mean being deficient or dumb. It just means they need to work a little differently. Good minds like yours (and your future students) shouldn’t go to waste.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 You are asking a far too complicated question for me to answer responsibly. What I can offer is some thoughts for you to consider: You are in your 60s. You are considering two very significant changes in your life that will have impact on both you and your husband.Before going ahead with either the surgery or the separation, I urge you to find an experienced therapist who works regularly with older clients and talk this through. You need input and support from a professional — especially since your husband is depressed.Therapy is not limited to relieving mental illness. Often we therapists serve as an objective sounding board for decision-making. Often we provide support and guidance for personal growth.As a senior myself, I’ve come to appreciate that it is sometimes more helpful to talk with an age-mate who understands issues around aging (and the life decisions that come with it) from a personal as well as a professional point of view. As actress Bette Davis once said, “Getting older is not for sissies.” Life decisions are more momentous because there is less time to make changes and less time to back away from those changes if we make a mistake.The decisions you are making are very, very important ones. Please don’t be impulsive about them. Don’t let other people pressure you into making them before you have given them the time, respect and consideration they deserve.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From a teen in Canada: So here’s the deal, I’ve never had a good childhood, i’ve dealt with issues like depression and suicidal ideation, and the one thing which has recently become more intense, was that I’ve always had trouble understanding how other people felt. Empathy is difficult for me, I find that I have to force emotions out of myself to at least appear sane to others.<|im_end|>

 I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of a letter, of course. You would need a face to face evaluation by a licensed therapist for that. But I can tell you that I don’t think you are sociopathic. It’s more likely that you are still working through the normal self-centeredness of adolescence.The teen years are an important time during which people work on figuring out who they are, who they want to be with, and what they want to do it life. It often is a time of unstable feelings and unstable relationships. It’s not unusual for a teen to look somewhat sociopathic at some point during the process. If you continue to question whether you are in the normal range, I do suggest you talk with a therapist. It’s likely that you will find it reassuring. On the off chance that there is some sociopathy, it will provide a forum for working on it.I wish you well, <|im_end|>"

I have taken antidepressants for 12 years but I just feel numb. I started taking Paxil 20 mg daily 11 yrs ago when my little brother committed suicide. We were very close. Then my Mom died 6 months later from cancer. Then 2-1/2 months after Mom died, my Dad committed suicide. I increased it to 30mg a few years later when my husband of 9 yrs left me because he couldn’t handle my being depressed. He acted very differently towards me after this all happened. He was never supportive or compassionate, instead he was abusive and cruel. I am still having a lot of trouble getting over this.<|im_end|>

I receive many questions about medication, oftentimes from individuals who, like you, have tried almost every antidepressant and still feel that their condition has barely or not at all improved. It could be that depression medication acts as a numbing agent and in some cases, may not be a very effective treatment for depression.Some people say that the medication helped them to feel less depressed but they also report, as did you, that it made them unable to experience any emotions. It might also be that the medication not only numbed your emotional pain but taking the medication may have prolonged your depression recovery.It is plausible that the medication may falsely give the impression that an individual’s emotional situation has improved but in reality, no real improvement has taken place. If medication serves as a temporary “band-aid,” numbing emotional pain, an individual may incorrectly believe that he or she has “treated” their depression. If the depression was never treated or it was simply “covered up” or “blocked” by the medication, then the real source of the depression may remain untreated. The harm in this approach is wasted time. That is, time not spent trying to understand or treat the real source of the depression. If the source of the depression remains, in this way, the medication may prolong or inhibit the improvement process.Please do not misunderstand my message. Medications can work to help decrease depression but they typically need to be used in conjunction with some form of psychotherapy. Used alone, medicine for depression seems to offer, for many, only very limited relief.A few months ago, there was a psychiatric pharmaceutical company running an ad on television that stated that studies showed that more than 70 percent of individuals who took antidepressant drugs still experienced depression. The ad also stated that individuals who took antidepressant drugs were encouraged to seek other forms of treatment such as psychotherapy. I mention this because it was interesting to hear a drug company that was marketing an antidepressant medication admit in a television advertisement that a majority of antidepressant users found medication to be largely ineffectual. It seems that even the manufacturers of antidepressants suggest that medication only is not a very effective form of treatment for depression. Effectively treating depression takes more than medication alone. It often takes psychotherapy in addition to or in place of medicine.You lived through several traumatic experiences. You felt depression, sadness and probably many other feelings regarding the unfortunate situations that have occurred in your life. The feelings that you experienced, regarding these issues, probably were part of a normal reaction to those life events. While those experiences where extremely painful, it might have been more beneficial for you to have felt those unpleasant emotions and learned how to manage them. It may have been helpful for you to have learned these life skills.I do not know if you should increase your medication or try another but if you have never tried psychotherapy, you should consider it. Maybe then you can learn how to “feel” again, deal with your past issues and finally find a way to decrease or eliminate your depression.<|im_end|>"

I have been dealing with anxiety for a few years now and I am just so tired of it. I’ve probably had anxiety since high school but didn’t really know it until college. I had a really hard time when I went away to school. I was lonely, upset, and stressed so I reached out to the counseling center. I have been seeing the same counselor now since my first semester of college (I will be going into my fourth year in August). I have gone through a few really rough times at school- crying everyday, feeling stressed an anxious even when I was having fun with my friends, just not knowing what to do or how to relax. Going to counseling has definitely helped me, but I feel like I need to do something else because I am still experiencing anxiety after all these years.<|im_end|>

 Thank you for asking this question. I admire you resilience in coping with this. GAD and separation anxiety can be difficult to cope with and the courage you are finding to keep looking for answers is quite commendable.I would make three recommendations the first is exercise. Exercise has a very particular influence on the brain in that it produces BDNF, a protein that helps with transmission of various neurotransmitters in the brain. Here’s an article I’ve written that includes information about this.The other activity that is getting widespread research and usage is yoga. Almost any style would be helpful, but the practice of yoga tends to be very helpful in coping with anxious feelings.Finally, you may want to talk to your registered dietitian — particularly one associated with your local health food store. The additive GABA is an amino acid that is not medicine and yet has had some interesting uses treating anxiety. You may want to research this and talk to your counselor about it. Here is some research on yoga and GABA you might find interesting.I wish you well with this and again I admire your resilience and coping. Keep challenging your anxiety.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: Can you offer guidance for how to provide limited help and set appropriate boundaries with needy, personality disordered family members?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Your difficult relatives are fortunate indeed to have such a compassionate and caring person in their family circle. You are certainly not alone in having aging or needy relatives who are less than wonderful. But knowing that isn’t very helpful, is it?I wish I had an easy answer to your question but I don’t. I do have some opinions but please do take into consideration that I only have a brief letter to go on.I worry about the present emphasis I see everywhere about the importance of “boundaries.” Too often, it implies putting up a wall. I think it’s more useful to define it as putting up a shield. Walls keep people out. Shields deflect the barbs of words and opinions so a relationship doesn’t hurt us.I therefore don’t agree that it is ever helpful to get “hard.” I do think you need to find ways to let the behaviors of the difficult people and the words and opinions of others roll off you.There is an old saying: “Consider the source.” You don’t have to take in what these difficult people or uninformed people say. You don’t have to argue. You don’t have to justify, apologize or explain anything. Ideally, you will find a way to smile and nod and say innocuous things like “I’ll think about that” or “Thanks for sharing” and move on.Then — and this is the important part — go to people who know the situation and who care about you for the hugs, validation, and support you deserve. You are blessed to have a stable and happy family. Don’t let the occasional visit with challenging people overshadow that.Compassion isn’t something that people have to deserve. We do what we can to ease the lives of elderly and/or difficult people because it is the right thing to do. But it is equally important to do right by yourself by turning to your own network for support so you can keep it in perspective.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hi, I am forty years old and currently single. My problem is a bit difficult to describe, but more or less it is the following: Even though I have no problem talking to women – or people in general – I somehow feel very strange when a communication with a girl/woman seems to be heading to flirting. It’s like something inside of me trying to hold me back and I feel like the need to get out of the situation. This may not be 100% of the times, but definitely a 90-95% for sure. This was not always the case. When I was younger, around 20, I remember myself wanting to be with women, to flirt and trying to find these things in life. Unfortunately for many years now this is not the case. I tend to believe that this was due to a very hard break up that I had when I was around 21. From discussions I had with a therapist she insists that this cannot be the case and that the cause should be in earlier years in life (when I was a child). Maybe it is important to explain, that I had relationships during the last 20 years though in almost all cases only when I was feeling wanted I moved on. I think there are a lot more that may explain my situation better, but I maybe these are enough as an initial approach. (From Greece)<|im_end|>

  It may be that both earlier experiences in your life and your hard breakup are informing your hesitancy. To move into a more intimate relationship may be anxiety-producing because you have loved and lost before. It tends to be that early relationships and experiences in childhood are linked in someway — not separate incidents. In any case it seems like your past is influencing what happens when you feel greater intimacy.I’d recommend the Keeping the Love You Find by Harville Hendricks. This will give you some of the elements of how attachment theory works. I’d would then talk about how you might take action in changing this pattern with your therapist.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From a teen in the U.S.: Ever since I was a child I had the tendency to imagine and create worlds and people inside my head whom I would interact with. I would spend hours upon hours just imagining different scenarios, conversations, and more people to add to the list. As I got older I couldn’t shake the urge of imagining things and soon enough I would retreat to my room playing music as loud as can be and hours would pass me by while I’m stuck in there doing nothing. I will pace my room in circles imagining this other reality and sometimes I will lie in bed in the dark to do the same if I cannot pace. What could this be brought on by? I have been diagnosed with depression and have been taking anti-depressants for years but this has always remained with me for as long as I can remember.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Since you are taking anti-depressants, I assume you are being treated by a professional. If you haven’t shared this information with your provider, you are doing yourself a great disservice. A professional only has what you tell them to go on.This habit could have developed out of loneliness as a child. It could indicate that you have an especially imaginative mind but don’t know what to do with it. Or it could be that there is an organic problem. Or it could be something else. Without investigating it, your mental health provider can’t help you figure it out.I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

 Hoarding is a complicated problem. Many people who hoard have powerful attachments to their stuff and strong beliefs about its importance. They assign value and meaning to things that other people can’t understand. Often their identity is tied up with their belongings.You can’t “make” your mother go to therapy. You can’t “make” her get rid of her things. If you try to dispose of anything, she will be angry and upset with you and will probably become even more protective of her stuff.However, you may be able to talk to her about how her home has become unmanageable and how her stuff is getting in the way of her relationships with the people who love her. If you fight with her, she won’t be able to listen. Instead, you need to stay calm and loving while you ask her to help you understand how the items she collects help her and what they mean to her. You may then begin to work with her to find ways to carve out some spaces in the house that aren’t overwhelmed by her collections.A book you may find helpful is Stuff: Compulsive Hoarding and the Meaning of Things by Randy O. Frost and Gail Steketee. In it, the authors describe their work in helping people who hoard begin to sort and organize their possessions and even let some of them go.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 From the U.S.: I have been plagued all my life with a lack of memory for practically my whole past. I have a handful of memories for my entire childhood; none for junior high school; very little for high school and, pretty much as soon as an event in my life is over, I have just a little bit of memory of what I experienced. But the fact of my childhood and early teenage years basically being erased in my memory banks, is the hardest to live with.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
At 69, memory issues are common, but you say this has been going on for your whole life. There are many possible medical reasons. I hope that you talked to your primary care doctor about it long ago.There are also possible psychological explanations. Chief among them is that life changed dramatically in some way at some point in your life that made memories of what happened before it no longer relevant. You see, memory isn’t like a video library. What we remember is selective. Usually, memories in some way confirm how we look at the world today.If you were seeing me in therapy, we’d be talking about why this is bothering you so much now that you wrote to us. We would look at whether something happened that changed your perceptions of the world so much that you discarded memories that didn’t fit. We might also discuss whether it would be helpful to you to try to connect with childhood friends for some reminders about what once was. It’s complicated.If this continues to trouble you and your medical doctor sees no reason for memory lapses beyond what is typical at your age, then by all means see a therapist who can explore it with you.I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

I am a 25 year old guy. I have no problem getting an erection while making out and foreplay, but as soon as I put the condom, I have difficulty maintaining an erection.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 This is an important question. Thank you for asking it. It is very common and some sources identify that nearly half the men using condoms experience it: You are not alone. It is important to note that in your case this is likely to be psychological rather than physical. If you are able to masturbate with it on — then it is likely to be about you anxiety with your partner.First look at the transition time. The act of stopping to put the condom on may be the problem. Ask your partner to keep stimulating you (or you do it yourself) while putting it on. Staying stimulated rather than getting hard again may help.Secondly, consider other forms of contraception, like spermicide, which doesn’t protect you from venereal disease in the way a condom does, but is an effective way of preventing pregnancy.Finally, keep experimenting with different condoms and talking with your partner. As your anxiety goes down and the skill level goes up you are likely to overcome your circumstance.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Lately I have had this constant nagging feeling when I get home. Like I’m worthless, maybe broken or damaged beyond repair. I am not suicidal as most I have found here but rather I have this horrible fear that I will die before I can fix my problems. before I finally get up and do something about it. At work I excel and am constantly receiving praise. Currently my mother lives with me and her and I have always had a horrible relationship. Though her complaints may sometimes be true, she is the child of an abuser and she says things so aggressively. She tells me I’m a 500lb loser that nobody cares about (I am overweight but certainly not 500lbs). Sometimes as soon as I come home she picks a fight and it like my whole day gets ruined. In my head I know just who I want to be and what I want to do but its as though I’m paralyzed. I want to lose weight but I lack will power and self control. All of my relationships end in angry emotional words filled with hate. What steps should I take to turn my life around and develop some sort of structure?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You feel as if you are “worthless, maybe broken or damaged beyond repair.” It is a nagging feeling. Each individual must find his unique way in life. Jung would call this individuation. Maslow would term this self-actualization. Existentialists would refer to this process as living authentically.If I may speak generally and of course I have no choice since I am unaware of all of the details of your life, persons in your situation have stopped the process of growth that I have referred to above. The unpleasant feeling that you have described seems to be the same one that I have heard described by hundreds of clients. It is an urging to move forward. Where does that urge come from? Well that depends on what theory you ascribe to and thus what language you would use that would be true to that specific theory.Though the theories use differing language, the message is very similar. To be happy, to live a life of meaning, you must follow that path of self-growth. That path may take you to another continent, to a completely new career, to a new life philosophy or to the realization that you must separate from your mother. The path of growth will not be easy in any case.One can think of a thousand reasons why moving to a new continent is impossible, why a career change is ridiculous, why it is preposterous to think of accepting a new life philosophy and how it is unthinkable to separate from one’s mother. The required changes, whatever they might be, are all hard, maybe extremely so but they are absolutely necessary to your life.If you were to ask Jung or Maslow or Nietzsche, they would tell you that all people, including your mother, must face this growth process.Jung considered murder the only unforgivable sin. You must not take another life but you cannot let another take your life from you. They are both sins.I have already stated clearly that I could be wrong in your specific case because I cannot be specific with knowing specifics. However, in general, when applied to “being” en masse, it is so very true.A good counselor/therapist would get the specifics that this Internet format denies me. I would highly recommend you begin the solution to this problem by finding a therapist who could provide you the additional insight that will help you along the path to self-actualization, individuation, authenticity etc.The “find help” tab, at the top of this page, can help you locate psychotherapists in your community. Goup therapy may also be very beneficial. I wish you the best. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 What neither of us knows is whether your mom is just playing with these fantasies or if she intends to act on them. The best case scenario is that she is bored, has no intention of following through and is just playing games. The worst case scenario is that she is intending to meet up with people who will initially be charmed by her stories and then angered by being played.I think you do need to have a straight talk with her about what you discovered and your concerns. Do not approach her with anger or judgment — just concern. Do not get drawn into a battle. She’s an adult. She has a right to live life as she sees fit as long as it doesn’t endanger her life or others. Ask for reassurance that she is going to keep herself and the family safe.Meanwhile: Just because your mom invites you to a fight, doesn’t mean you have to go along. The fights only escalate because you decide to participate in them. You really don’t need to fight. Your brother doesn’t need to fight. Your grandmother should not have to step in to settle family arguments.If your mother provokes, just calmly state that you aren’t going to fight and leave. Leave the room. Leave the house if you have to. But don’t fight back. You already know it doesn’t get you anywhere. It just stresses you out.I hope you are looking into a way to finance your education that will let you leave home. Work. Apply for grants. Talk to the financial aid office at your school. If you really do need to live there, arrange your life to minimize contact with your mom. Study at school. Work out at the school gym. You and your mother have a better chance to be friendly if you aren’t in each other’s space. You can live more peacefully and you can give your brother an important lesson in how to manage the situation.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I hope I’m just a perfectionist, but sometimes I feel like my behavior is too bizarre. I like order, routine, and organization, but I am not sure if I’m going too far with this. If fail anything I gave effort to I will not except it. I will beat myself up over it until I get it. One very unhealthy example of this would be my eating behavior. I want the perfect body and I don’t care how much mental exhaustion I have to deal with to get it. I fast for days and I refuse to eat foods that I deem as “bad”. If I do end up breaking this, which happens during breaks or family reunion dinners, I make up by extreme dieting next few days. Another example would be in school. I will study until I can no longer see words clearly on the paper or the screen, which some people might think is a good habit, so I am not exactly sure about this particular case. Another thing my friend thought was weird about a specific habit I have is washing my hands for exactly 30 seconds. I read about it somewhere that it takes 30 seconds for germs to actually come off, so again I’m not sure if not is actually abnormal. I just feel like people tell me my behavior is abnormal but I just think they’re exaggerating, because most people want to meet the average expectations. But I also do understand that many people close to me point out my obsessions in a negative way so I am just wondering if I am the one not seeing clearly or is everyone else in my life average achievers (sorry I don’t know any other term to use). One other mental process I want to point out about myself is that I see behavior in black and white terms. What I mean by this is that you’re either “perfect” or a “failure”. Clean or dirty. I don’t see topics such as politics in black and white, but behavior and characteristics that describe humans.<|im_end|>

One way to describe your thinking and behavior may be mental rigidity. In other words, you are inflexible in your thinking and behavior. You force yourself to think and behave in a particular way based on artificial, self-imposed standards. That type of “all or nothing” thinking and inflexibility, breeds feelings of negativity and disappointment.For instance, you wrote that you will do something until you are mentally exhausted. That seems unnecessary and extreme. Working until mental exhaustion seems like an inefficient way to do things. Take studying for instance. There are good ways to study and there are “not so” good ways to study. Though it may seem counterintuitive, cramming for a test is a poor way to prepare because it sacrifices the sleep your brain needs to perform adequately. Thus, it would be unwise to cram until mental exhaustion.I can never offer a diagnosis over the internet, thus it would be wise to consult a local therapist about the possibility of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). An in-person evaluation would be best to determine if a disorder is present. No matter your diagnosis, counseling could assist in refining your thinking and behavior. Ideally, it’s best to be flexible in your thinking and behavior. You want to be smart and efficient with your time and energy. You don’t want to over- or under-do things. It’s admirable to have life goals but it could be that your self-imposed rules are causing unnecessary stress in your life. Should that be true, counseling is the ideal remedy. Good luck and please take care.<|im_end|>"

 This may be a cross-cultural issue I don’t entirely understand. From my point of view, the problem isn’t with your in-laws. The problem is that you and your husband haven’t worked together to draw boundaries around your own family.The two of you are letting the older generation make decisions that, from an American’s point of view anyway, aren’t their decisions to make. I understand that the grandparents want to spend time with their child and grandchild. But I can’t imagine relatives announcing (not asking) that they will stay for months at a time in an already crowded apartment.I strongly urge you and your husband to talk seriously and calmly about to what extent you are going to continue doing things that are perhaps traditional in India, but are not at all the way western families operate. From an American point of view, you and your husband are adults, not children who need to do whatever his parents think is right. Your in-laws can only come to visit if the two of you let them. People can only stay with you as long as you agree to let them stay. Your in-laws should not have the power to decide when and for how long you will visit your own parents. It’s your husband’s job to tell his parents to treat the wife he loves with respect. It is your job to calmly but firmly tell them that their insults are not appropriate. But those are all American responses to their behavior.It doesn’t have to be one way or the other; Asian or America: You can decide on compromise positions. You may have to make changes gradually. As examples: You could limit visits to a month a year or state that relatives can certainly visit but they need to stay in a nearby hotel. You could decide to alternate visits between his family and yours to make things fair and even. You could ignore your in-laws dictates and decide your own travel schedule so that your family gets to spend as much time with you and your child as your in-laws.Change is never easy. But neither is the current situation. You are caught between two value systems — the one you were brought up with and the one you are living in now. I hope you and your husband can figure out how to balance the two, even though his parents probably won’t like it.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I had a dream, not just an ordinary dream, but it was very very real. I’m a Christian and very active in my church. In my dream, there is a woman whom I’ve never dated although I find her attractive. I’ve never had sexual thoughts about her. In the dream I go in a room, she is in bed but under the covers, nothing showing. There were several mirrors on the wall but covered in wood, like the wood over a castle window. I don’t know how I knew they were mirrors but I did. I go over to her, lean down, kiss her on the forehead and then the dream ends. What in the world could this mean????? I’ve looked all over for an interpretation but can’t find an answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Thanks for asking about the dream. I think it’s very interesting. It would be hard to know exactly but the dream would mean without knowing more of the context, but I know that dreams are trying to tell us something that’s usually very important.Dreams tend to offer themes and these themes are disguised in various ways so as not to arouse our anxiety.You could probably find dozens of therapists trained in a variety of different forms –from psychoanalysis, Jungian psychology, to Gestalt and all of them would have a different version of the dream. But since you’ve asked me, I’ll tell you what I notice. That is all. Take any interpretation with a grain of salt. Find an interpretation that works for you.The two essential points in the dream are that something is covered. The first thing you describe is the fact that this woman’s body is covered. The second is that there are mirrors, but they are covered too. So why would this be? One possibility is that the mirrors are covered so there would be no opportunity for self-reflection; the woman’s body is covered so there’d be no temptation.The kiss on the forehead is an interesting way for the dream to end. The most important element is what the gesture rules out. This is a non-sexual gesture. Appreciation rather than a sexual awakening.My psychoanalytic, Jungian and Gestalt colleagues will be shaking their virtual heads — but they can comment if they like.Finally the meaning of the dream — regardless of the interpretation I’ve offered — has to do with how you felt as the dream ends. Were you complacent? Was the kiss in the forehead an acknowledgement of the relationship as it is enough? Or was this a dream that ended with anxiety and frustration? Understanding the feeling in the dream often tells us what we need to pay attention to.Hope this was helpful.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I’ve been in a 6 year LDR with a bf who I LOVE but I absolutely hate how the LDR has turned into a complete nightmare for me. We met right before I transferred away for college & he left a year later. I was in CA and he was in NY. We made it work but only because I would pull tooth & nail to get him to agree for me to come visit. This happened every 2-4 months when I reached my limit for being away from him. His dream was to work abroad after college so he left to Seoul. That was 3 years ago and he’s been throughout Asia since, changed careers twice and is now starting his own company. My issue is multi-faceted: 1) I’m starting med school next year and have made it very clear that I needed him to be a part of this extremely impt process 2) He has a girlfriend that he’s lived with for 2 years and been with for longer. I know about her, she doesn’t know about me. I don’t date other men but he has gf’s that I’ve known about since we started but due to the abuse our relationship has taken I’m now against him having his live-in gf because of the wedge it’s put in our relationship. We’ve gotten to a point where his travels and lifestyle has reduced our relationship to texting and maybe a 5 minute phone call weekly. He’s great when we’re actually physically together. I just absolutely hate who he is or isn’t for our relationship when he’s away. How do I express my desire to close this relationship without making him feel like I don’t support his work? Have I let this go way too far with the travel + gf’s (Why buy a cow when the milk’s free)? We’ve planned for kids, marriage, I live with his parents. Help I’m so confused when I wake up at least once a week infuriated and wanting to and have attempted to break up with him because this relationship has been reduced to bits.<|im_end|>

 I’m not sure what you are waiting for. I’d say it time to walk away from him and into your life. It sounds to me like you have always put more into the relationship than he has, and you have no reason to worry about him. He is living with someone else, for Pete’s sake! How can you be planning marriage and children when he has never really been a true partner?I’m not sure why you are worried that if you break it off with him it somehow implies that you don’t support his career. That’s all you’ve done, and where is he now that it’s your time to focus on medical school? Is he running to be by your side?To be even more blunt, I’m not really sure you have a relationship to walk away from.  Does texting and a 5-minute phone call really constitute a significant relationship? I don’t mean to be harsh, it’s just that it seems to me that you have made enough sacrifices and have not received much in return. Medical school is difficult and time consuming and it’s also your time to shine. Let go of him, let go of the past, and open yourself up to all the possibilities in front of you.  Chances are that when you do, a real partner will show up and walk this path beside you.All the best,<|im_end|>"

From Indonesia: I am sorry if my English is not that good. I’ve been diagnosed with pure Os for 10 years or so, and I’ve been drinking SSRIs for 2 years, which helped me a lot. Now my obsessions are lowered and there is only one kind of fear that buggers me a lot. I am afraid of being influenced by someone’s opinion, when that person doesn’t like the things that I like. I am afraid that by understanding her/his perspective, I’ll stop enjoying the things that I do enjoy. It works on some emotional level even when I understand how unreasonable is that fear of mine.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Thank you for writing. Let me see if I can help: Researchers have not yet discovered why some people develop obsessions. It likely has something to do with your neurology. But whatever the cause, it can be debilitating. It can interfere with a person’s social and occupational life. Like you, people with obsessions know the obsessions are irrational and want them to go away. But wanting them to go away is rarely enough.Medication is often helpful. You said that SSRIs have reduced the number and intensity of your obsessions. For that reason, I do suggest that you return to your prescriber to talk about whether a change in dosage or a change in the type of SSRI would be helpful. It might also be advisable to augment the SSRI with another medication. Sometimes medication that has been working for a while becomes less effective. When that happens, a prescriber might consider another type of medication.You didn’t mention therapy. I encourage you to consider adding therapy to your treatment. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is often effective in further reducing the unwanted and intrusive thoughts. The goal of CBT is to help a person change the way they think, feel, and behave.It is unlikely that you will completely stop worrying about things. OCD is a chronic condition. But you can become more in charge of your thoughts and less stressed by them. I’ve had success with a number of clients who came to me after years of suffering. A combination of good medication monitoring and regular therapy helped them a great deal.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I am 16 and have been thinking how to word this for days. Firstly, I am terrified by all social situations and people terrify me. To cope with this I like to analyse situations in my head before I do them. Sometimes I see small details and they get to me really deeply. When it comes to confronting the problem I get angry with myself and them. When this happens I often just forget all emotions and memories (everythjng i am) and start to have urges and feelings. All my emotions are usually certain or confused at this point. I don’t do happiness or sadness when this happens. I just am a blank canvas. Sometimes when this happens I start to have homicidal thoughts towards the other person, I can stop myself but I hate myself afterwards. To escape from this I have my own world in my head where all my problems are solved. If I can’t calm myself down enough to do that I self harm. Usually this is with a hammer and in places it can’t be seen as a knife would be noticed.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Being terrified of social situations, high levels of anxiety, and feelings of being overwhelmed are signs of a panic or anxiety attack. Your response in those situations is to become angry at others, homicidal, in fact. The way you handle the aftermath of the panic or anxiety attack is to engage in self-harm. In essence, you’re punishing yourself. You seem to have developed a maladaptive and unhealthy way of dealing with this set of issues.Mental health intervention would greatly benefit you. A therapist could address your social anxiety and your tendency to engage in self-harm. People feel anxious around others when they don’t think highly of themselves and assume that others feel the same way about them. They lack self-confidence and become excessively self-conscious when they’re in the presence of others. With the right intervention, social anxiety is a highly treatable condition.You should report these symptoms to your parents and ask for their assistance in seeking mental health treatment. Speaking to your parents about these issues might be difficult but I would encourage you to try. Medication and psychotherapy are proven treatments for both social anxiety and self-harm. Writing to us at Psych Central is a good first step. The next logical step is to speak to your parents and to seek the proper mental health treatment. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Over the past 6 years or so, I have experienced various symptoms of depression which i seemed to be coping with until recently. I have started to suffer from sleep paralysis and hallucinations which are affecting my desire to sleep and making me paranoid and fearful.The hallucinations started off small (e.g spiders or towels hanging from the ceiling) but the other day i was paralysed in my bed and saw a figure dressed in all white (similar to a KKK outfit but with no eye-holes). It was staring at me from the entrance of my room while i wasd paralysed and it was not going away so i tried my best to free myself from the paralysis to atack the figure but when i jerked myself out of bed the figure disintigrated. I casn not stop thinking about this and have started to sleep with the lights on or try and stay awake all night. Thanks for your help<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Sleep paralysis might be an indication of a sleep disorder. Inform your primary care physician about your sleep problems. Your doctor may prescribe a sleep medication to help you sleep through the night. Being able to sleep through the night might make sleep paralysis less noticeable. We all experience sleep paralysis. It is protective to stop us from physically reacting to the content of our dreams. On occasion, we enter a state where we are in between sleep and consciousness. That is when we become aware of sleep paralysis. As we continue to wake up, the paralysis goes away. It can be frightening but it is harmless.Your doctor will also likely suggest undergoing a sleep study. A sleep study entails your staying the night at a local hospital or clinic. While asleep, technicians will measure how well you sleep and closely monitor what is happening while you’re sleeping. A sleep study can identify whether or not you have a sleep disorder. Many sleep disorders are highly treatable.I would also recommend being evaluated by a mental health professional. You stated that you have had depression for six years and you have recently noticed it becoming worse. There is likely a correlation between the worsening of your depression and your sleep problems. Effectively treating your depression symptoms will likely improve your sleep.Sleep is very important to maintain emotional stability. Without sleep, it’s nearly impossible to able to function well or effectively. I hope this problem can soon be resolved. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I think my emotions are suppressed and its taking a toll on me and my relationship with my spouse. I can never say what I intend to say as the people around me do not accommodate that as I live with my in-laws. My privacy and my space is intruded at times. My anger is building up and my tolerance level has gone down. I am sending nasty msges to my husband for his unbelievably irritating family and we are having arguments. I live with threats from my husband that if I tell of his people, then I have to leave his house. By the way, I have my own place but we don’t live there because my husband is overly “filial” and his parents want him to live with them. Can you help me?

 From what you’ve written, it seems you are very unhappy with your living arrangements. When you complain about your in-laws, your husband threatens to make you leave their home. Your letter did not specify this, but it seems as though your husband is unwilling to leave his parents despite your unhappiness. Thus your predicament.As I see it, you have two options: find a way to live peacefully with your in-laws or move out.Continuing to live with your in-laws certainly is not an ideal situation but it may be necessary to stay in your marriage. You don’t have to suppress your emotions, but you might have to suppress your complaints. Complaining would only make the situation worse.Only you know how much of this situation you can tolerate. If you are no longer willing to accept this living arrangement, then you might need to move out.Living with your in-laws, rarely works. Sometimes, depending on the country you live in, it is customary. But customs are not necessarily right. Living with your in-laws has already caused problems between you and your husband. He needs to worry about the damage that is occurring to your marriage.Finally, you should consider marriage counseling. With the help of an objective third-party, you and your husband might be able to develop a satisfactory living arrangement. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

To start, the relationships I get into begin wonderfully. I am intent on being in a relationship with a certain person, and so I do whatever is necessary to get them to fall for me. I become obsessed with learning everything I can about them. I “love bomb” them, so to speak. I learn all their strengths and all their faults, but eventually they lose their luster to me and I abandon them in pursuit of something else. The feelings just seem to die overnight. Ironically, I am a very private person. I like to control how people perceive me, and I really don’t like it when people talk about me and learn things they don’t need to know. Therefore, I am guilty of “gaslighting”. If I don’t want someone to know that I had dinner with my father last Tuesday, whoever told them will be called out as a liar by me. I have sexual fantasies about almost every person I meet, but when I get the chance to act on those fantasies I find it difficult to follow through. One minute I’m high on my own thoughts, and the next minute it’s all gone once they are in my grasp. When I am not doing any of these things and when I am not working, I am completely alone. I can resist contact with others like my family and friends for months. Loneliness gives me more pleasure than anything else. If I couldn’t be alone, I’d go mad. I’ve been called a psychopath/sociopath by some of my exes because they felt like I disregarded their feelings constantly and because I left them very easily, without regret or care for how it hurt them. I’m just not willing to invest in someone that I’ve lost interest in. The people in my life have brought to my attention that this behavior is inappropriate, atrocious, and disturbing. However, I don’t think so. I don’t understand how gaslighting and love bombing count as abuse. Is all of this some form of detachment? Or am I just harmlessly different?<|im_end|>

 Based on the description you have provided, your behavior does not necessarily seem outside the norm. When people are dating, they are trying to find a match. Both people tend to be on their very best behavior. When you first meet someone new, you’re trying to learn everything you can about them. That takes time. Once you realize they’re not for you, you end it. It would be odd to stay with someone with whom you are not a match.You didn’t elaborate on how you end these relationships and that might be the problem. I would need more information about the manner in which you end these relationships to determine if it is a problem.I’m not certain that I fully understand your example of “gaslighting.” Gaslighting, as I understand it, is essentially manipulating someone into believing something that isn’t true. In your example, you “call out” people as liars, who are not guilty of lying. That type of behavior will most certainly cause you to lose relationships. Not many people are willing to tolerate that type of abuse.If you want an objective evaluation of how you behave in relationships, then try counseling. The therapist will analyze your relationships and determine if there is a problem. The fact that people repeatedly tell you that your behavior is problematic would suggest that you are the common denominator and thus may be the source of the problem but you need an objective opinion. I don’t have enough information to give you that objective opinion. Counseling is the solution. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 I’m very concerned that you didn’t have some therapy after the birth and adoption of your first baby. Even when giving up the baby was the right thing to do, it is not at all uncommon for women who have surrendered a baby and not had therapy to have a “replacement baby” to ease the sense of loss and longing.This is too big a decision for you and your boyfriend to make on your own, especially since you do not have the resources to be independent. You probably do need to involve your family. But before you do, I strongly urge you to have a few sessions with a therapist who has experience with adoption issues. Your local Planned Parenthood health center has specially trained staff who can talk with you about all of your options. (See more at: https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/pregnancy/pregnant-now-what). The therapist will help you clarify what you want to do and how best to involve your parents.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My dad is emotionally, verbally, and sometimes physically abusive to me. He has threatened to disown me and I now wish he would have. I am very afraid of him and my mother has now also became emotionally abusive to me. I cut myself about 10 times each night on my hips where no one can see and I tend to find myself crying for no reason. I make things in my head and later I cannot remember what actually happened, what did not, and who is real or just a figment of my imagination. I have very restless sleep and i have a loft-bed and will sometimes punch or kick my cieling in my sleep and will wake up with bloody knuckles. Sometimes i will wake up in a heap on the ground after falling the nine feet down to my hard floor. My house appears good on the outside but on the inside it is not a good place to be. My dad has even thrown a cat on me while I was in the shower, this was about two years ago but I still have the scars. He tells me I’m worthless and a stupid disapointment to him and the rest of my family. I think about suicide quite often and I have recently became bullimic because he will tell me I’m fat and ugly. I feel lost all the time and am always afraid to be caught insecure. I will often lie on the floor crying curled up in a ball with my blade I ripped off of my dad’s razor. My parents know i cut but they said they only cared because it could result in something looking bad on them. I am afraid in my own home. I am afraid of myself. I am afraid of everyone around me.

 I am very sorry for what you are enduring. You are frightened for your safety in your own home. You cannot protect yourself. I would strongly encourage you to call and report your situation to the Child and Youth Services in your state. The telephone number is 800-252-2873. Report to them what you have experienced. Be as detailed as possible.If you feel that you might harm yourself, then call 911. You should also have in your possession the phone number to the National Suicide Prevention Helpline: 1-800-273-TALK (8255).Another option is to inform a faculty member at your school about your situation. School officials who become aware of your situation are mandated by law to call child protective services.It is imperative that you report your situation to the proper authorities. You need help. I know that asking for help may be difficult and frightening but it is important that you do it anyway. No child should have to experience what you have described.

I’m a junior in high school and I’ve never had any friends in school or outside of school. I was bullied from 5th grade to my sophomore year. It got so bad I begged my mom to let me be homeschooled. I have always been a shy person especially in school. Sometime during the summer of 2009 is when my shyness got extreme. I left my old school and went to a new school for 8th grade. The first day of school I was extremely nervous. The kids there were nice but I was so affected by the bullying I had endured at my previous school that I became scared of everyone. I became disconnected from people. I sat a lunch at a table with no one but myself. If people tried to talk to me I ignored them. Once that worked I started hiding in books. I read during lunch so on one would talked to me. I did that for a long time. When I got to highschool I became invisible to people. I was scared of my peers. I skipped lunch everyday. I did out in the bathrooms because I was affraid of walking in the lunch room and having all eyes on me. In class raised my hand because I was affraid of everyone looking at me. I’m 17 and I’m terrified of going in stores by myself. I don’t like people looking at me. I have to go in with my mom. I have panic attacks when I go in malls. I freak out when I see groups of teenagers. When I walked past them my heart starting racing and my hands get sweating and my face feels flushed. My mom doesn’t understand that I’m going through something. She tells my its just a phase. I’ve been getting panick attacks of going into places I know have peers in them since I was in 7th grade. I avoid being in situations with a lot of people. Whether it be stores or malls. My mom says that “I’m almost 18 I need to have social interaction.” My answer is ” I can’t people make me extremely nervous and anxious. I don’t know what to do. I’m worried about what I will do once I graduate. I’m almost 18 and I rely on my family for everything. I don’t drive. I have no goals. I’m very smart but I don’t want to go to school because of the fear I get around my peers. I feel like I won’t ever get a job. I in my house for 89% percent of the time.<|im_end|>

 The continued avoidance of that which you fear is effectively worsening your social anxiety disorder. Removing yourself from an anxious situation is reinforcing. It makes you feel better. Feeling better is a “reinforcement.” The first law of behaviorism states that “if a reinforcer follows a behavior, then that behavior will increase in the future.” In your case, that behavior is avoiding social situations.For instance, take the example of your being frightened to go to the mall. It probably happens this way: enroute to the mall, your anxiety builds. By the time you arrive, your anxiety is severely heightened. The severe anxiety makes it difficult to leave your vehicle and you ultimately return home instead of going into the mall. Upon leaving the mall, your anxiety diminishes significantly and by the time you arrive home, your anxiety is virtually nonexistent.By leaving the situation at the height of the anxiety, you have made your social anxiety worse. Ideally, you should have gone into the mall despite your high level of anxiety. It would undoubtedly have been difficult to “sit with” that high level of anxiety but it would have eventually diminished.Without treatment, social anxiety disorder tends to become worse. At this time, you find it difficult to leave home. Social anxiety is negatively affecting many aspects of your life. I would recommend seeking professional treatment. Very effective treatments exist for social anxiety disorder. Choose a mental health professional who specializes in social anxiety disorder. You may also want to choose someone who has specialized training in exposure and response prevention therapy, which is a specific cognitive-behavioral therapy designed to treat social anxiety disorder. You are a perfect candidate for treatment. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

It has been more than a year now , I feel alone, depressed, don’t feel like talking to anyone, just like to be alone. Also have been too much emotional these days. I don’t have any girl friend or even a person who cares for me , except my mother, in my entire life. This all has started because I cant see my mother not getting respect from my father after staying with him for almost 30 years. I feel this so much , but I am not able to speak on this with either of them. I just keep on crying from inside. I cry while sleeping thinking of all this. This is affecting my behavior and I am no more a social person. I have lost all my friends. Even in office I just talk work. Some of my close friends say that I inspire them with the way I work, but when I come back home I just see all those things which I have seen over the years which makes me to forget the kind of person I am or I was to be. I have never got love. Because of all this my self esteem is gone way low. I am confident when it is work, but when colleagues go for tea break or lunch together I am uncomfortable to go with them as I don’t know or I am not confident on my behavior. I don’t sleep well, I stay awake late nights, get up late in morning. I have lost weight not eating much. Also about my past , I am not been able to do much friendship in school and college as well. Even in my family I have always been kept aside for all important things, they just think that I cant do it just because I don’t speak much. I am fed up of all these, these days and I am seeking for an advice or help. It would be glad if someone can talk to me or can help me to find way out of this. Thanks in advance !!

 Thank you for writing in with your question. It can be very difficult watching people you love being mistreated and feeling that there’s nothing you can do about it. I’m sorry that this is the case for you. However, you are an adult now and it is time for you to begin living your own life.It sounds like you are a hard worker and have had success in your career, perhaps you can draw upon these skills and talents to help you expand your life in other ways. You can improve your social skills and begin to form meaningful relationships outside of your family. The only way to build confidence is to practice. The only way to feel comfortable around people is to be around them.It may be helpful to start small. Go to lunch with only one or two coworkers at a time, or make sure to walk out of work at the same time someone else does and strike up a conversation while you walk. Sometimes it helps to make friends in new situations so there is no pressure, such as a coffee shop or by taking a class pertaining to a hobby or interest. You could also benefit from speaking with a therapist or counselor because it sounds like your concerns may have led to some depression.As sad as it is, you cannot fix your parents’ relationship, but you can learn from theirs in order to have a healthy one yourself. And, you can show your mother respect by having a full and happy life and giving her a safe, happy place to spend time once you have your own home and family. Rather than spending your time worrying about her, spend it making her proud of you.All the best,<|im_end|>"

 When I read your letter, my first response was “of course she’s irritable.” You have a complicated and lengthy history of traumatic events. Without specific treatment, most people in your situation develop symptoms, often several symptoms, irritability being one of them. It is no surprise to me that you are tired and tired of it.I’m sorry you haven’t found helpful helpers. Since you can’t afford private treatment, I do urge you to look into whether there is a community mental health center nearby. Often such centers have a sliding fee scale. You might also look into whether there is a women’s center or domestic violence center near you. Often, they too offer low or no fee services. Your physician may be able to provide you with some recommendations.In addition, I encourage you to participate in one of the forums here at PsychCentral. Members provide support and advice to each other. I think you would find it a relief to chat with people who understand and who might have some practical ideas for managing your feelings.You deserve and need good trauma treatment. You are only 52.

Lived an eventful life up until the summer of 2011 when I began to smoke marijuana frequently. Noticed that I began to feel emptier, like I didn’t know who I was but thought it was because of the cold weather coming up(I usually get a little gloomy during winter.) I disregarded it and continued to smoke until January 2, 2012. I remember the night very clearly – I smoked up and tried to go to sleep, but my thoughts kept looping in circles and I felt that I finally convinced myself that I was insane. I felt a part of my brain shut down. When I woke up, I felt like I wasn’t in my body and that everything was dream-like. I developed anxiety and it’s beginning to really hinder my ability to do well in school and social interactions frighten me. I feel like everybody hates me.

 Your concern is a relatively common one. I receive many letters from individuals who have used an illicit drug and subsequently developed similar side effects. The side effects are frightening and psychologically damaging. These repeated negative experiences underscore why drug use is so dangerous.Psychoactive drugs have a physical effect upon the brain. When we consume a substance, it enters our blood stream. There is a protective mechanism in the body called the blood-brain barrier. This barrier keeps unhealthy substances from entering the brain. It is almost 100 percent efficient, but some substances get through. These are the psychoactive substances. They change the brain chemistry. Users hope the change is temporary but that may not always be the case. Drug usage is dangerous. It’s a risk and any user needs to consider that risk. Can drug usage cause serious psychological problems? Yes, undoubtedly so.If you are currently using illicit drugs, then stop immediately. I would also suggest being evaluated by a mental health professional. A mental health professional could gather a detailed psychosocial personal history and determine what may be wrong. He or she can also provide the appropriate psychosocial intervention to assist you with your symptoms. During the evaluation, a mental health professional may also suggest that you see a psychiatrist. A psychiatrist may prescribe a medication to assist with your anxiety and your “dream-like” symptoms.I understand that dealing with your symptoms is difficult. It is important to see a professional. It is the right course of action. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I really want to run away from home (I’m 18 yo) because of my toxic family. I really feel like I’m on the edge from just going insane because I feel helpless/hopeless. I’m someone who is forced to be isolated and I have low self-esteem/poor confidence from what I believe is emotional abuse from my childhood. The people I live with are belittling and make me feel bad about myself. They’re the reason I have low self-esteem issues and I feel worthless/incapable. I want to defend myself but I don’t know how to cause I’m scared to and I’m honestly not used to defending myself. It’s even come to the place where I might have to physically defend myself. Can you please advise me on what I should do to build my confidence and courage so I can stand up for myself? What should I do about wanting to run away from home even though I have nowhere to go, but sometimes home really makes me want to snap? (From the USA)<|im_end|>

Thank you for writing to us. In spite of all their belittling and emotional abuse there is an invincible and unbelievably strong part of you that had the courage to write this email. The part of you that knows the situation you’re in isn’t healthy and has your best interest at heart is the part we want to honor. Don’t let go of this feeling of the need to take care of yourself. It may be difficult, but it is the healthiest part of you and we want to recognize that it is alive and well and needs to be nurtured.You need to plan. A plan for your independence and living out and away from your dysfunctional families influence. The work for you right now is to look at your options. Whatever they are they need to lead you out and away from this house. Look at all possibilities. Perhaps it is time to join the Armed Forces, go back to school, or take a job where you can live more independently out and away from your family. The first part of the plan is to deeply investigate what are your options. The second part will be to act on them.The sooner you can do this the better, but give yourself a deadline. Will it be three months? Six months? A year? You need to motivate yourself toward the goal of getting out by making that the most important goal in front of you.One of the most effective forms of goal setting comes from what is known as S-M-A-R-T Goals. This acronym stands for Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Realistic, Timely. I am advocating for you to start planning goals for yourself that use this formula.The feeling of wanting to run away from home is a powerful one, but usually people who run don’t have a good enough plan to sustain themselves. If we are using the above method the first thing is to begin with a specific goal in mind. It could be to move out, it could be to save two thousand dollars, it might be to contact the woman’s shelter in your county for counseling. Whatever the goal make it clear and specific.Secondly, make sure this goal is measurable. A goal that says “I don’t want this to keep happening” is neither specific nor measurable. A goal that says I want to move out within a year and save 40 dollars a week so I can pay the deposit and the first month’s rent is both specific AND measurable.To make a goal actionable means you need to be able to do something toward it. The action, in this case, might be to get a job, or open up a savings account, or start looking at the cost of apartments or start talking to people who have done it. Goals must be something we are taking action on to achieve.The realistic part is essential. You don’t want to establish a goal like: “I’m moving into my own apartment next week,” if there isn’t any resources or opportunity for that to happen. Of course, what is realistic is something that can change one way or another with a shift in circumstances, but when you establish the goal make it one you can reach.Finally, pick a timeline that is reasonable and can keep you motivated. “I want to move out within ten years,” won’t help. A goal that is too quick would lead to failure and defeat. Make the goal something you’ll have to stretch for but not something that robs you of the engagement necessary to stay motivated to achieve it.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I have been in an unhappy marriage for five years, since our daughter was born to be exact. Although she makes me feel so lucky and a very happy mom, my husband and I seemed to agree to be a team and work together for the sake of her happiness. I always thought that doesn’t matter how difficult our relationship gets, I would never leave him because I don’t want our daughter to grow up with divorced parents. I promised this to myself, until I met “The One”.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
  I can’t tell you what to do. I can tell you that using “The One” to crowbar yourself out of your marriage is a mistake. Moving from one relationship to another without taking the time to heal generally results in repeating some version of the same situation. You need to take the time to make sense of why you were drawn into such an unloving marriage and to learn new ways to be in a relationship.If you want to leave your marriage, leave it for all the reasons you gave in your letter. Those are the reasons that matter — not the entrance of the new guy — and those are the reasons you should give your husband if you decide to separate. Neither of you should be distracted from those realities by focusing on “The One.” You should be talking about why your relationship is failing.Frankly, I don’t believe in anyone being “The One.” I think you are drawn to this guy because he is such a contrast to the man you are with, and he offers you a way out.If “The One” truly loves you, he will give you a year to recover from the marriage, to find your own identity outside of that relationship and to look at him clearly (without the stardust of being favorably contrasted with your husband).I sympathize with your desire to give your daughter a positive model for adult love. I understand why you want to give her the kind of stable upbringing you had. But it’s also important to consider whether the environment you and your husband have created for her is the healthiest.Fortunately, you and your daughter’s father do know how to be a solid parenting team. That shouldn’t change if you divorce. He should stay in her life.You and your daughter are both young. If you do divorce, you have plenty of time to recover and to find new love. You have plenty of time to work on making the kind of family you’ve always wanted.I wish you well, <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: Basically I got pregnant in a long distance relationship and after 8 months he finally moved to be with me. But I’ve read txts where he tells his mom he’s going to abandon the child and come back home to them after he makes enough money to pay off his debts. He tells me he’s just telling them that to calm them down. And the past few months before he moved to me, he was talking with other girls I didn’t know about and even was planning to date one of them “if he and I didn’t work out” and he was telling her he loved her and all this.<|im_end|>

 I think it’s time to face facts. It takes more than biology to make a father. Your baby doesn’t have a committed father now and probably won’t have one in the future. This man just isn’t into you or into making a family with you. Take a big step back. Don’t invest another minute of your time or your heart. You simply can’t rely on him now. People do change but only when they want to. Pull back from him unless and until you see evidence that he is sincerely interested in being the man you and your baby deserve.I hope you have family and friends who you can count on. Bringing a baby into the world should be a joyful and tender experience, not one fraught with stress and grief. Ask a good friend or relative to be with you during delivery so you can focus on the baby, not on a guy who doesn’t deserve your love.I wish you a safe and happy birthing. <|im_end|>"

I really hope I get an answer because it’ll go a long way to help me out in life. And in my part of the world therapy isn’t too common so life’s problems are blamed on several other weird stuff. I am 21 and it feels like my life’s crash down already. I got admitted into the university, everyone in my humble home had high hopes for me. I aced all my entry exams and got admitted with 2 scholarships. In my first year in school all seemed well, then I got myself involved with a girl. I did love her very much. I still do. But she left me. Though it wasn’t said to my face all indications pointed to the fact that I couldn’t treat her right or take care of her. I was devastated when she left. Around that time my Uni grades became horribly bad. So bad I knew I’d get 2 extra years in a 5-year course when I was in my second year. After a difficult job of pulling myself together. I found my self involved with another girl who had similar problems with mine. Her boyfriend was ‘mean’ to her & she felt she deserved better. I thought I was moving on only to realize I was just being used to forget the ‘mean ex’ or make the ‘mean ex’ jealous. 2 heartbreaks? Funny thing is sometimes I feel that’s the least of my problems. My biggest problem is graduating and making my parents smile once again. I’ve been thinking if disappearing for a awhile will help? I don’t want anybody thinking about me. I just want to be left alone. The first girl claims she misses me and the second girl seems comfortable with just the sex. I just want to be left alone … Is it normal? Will disappearing help?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 My suggestion would be to keep your eyes on the prize. Disappearing takes time away from your goal. This is a time in your life when you want to start attaining goals that you have set for yourself and completing your work at the University sounds like the most important thing in front of you. You want to be thinking about your needs and goals and prioritizing your own self care.What also seems clear for right now is that these two relationships became overwhelming for you emotionally. This may not be the best timing in life to try and balance a serious relationship with your studies.I would set my priorities so that you can accomplish your goal of completing your work at the university. After that you may want to look for more intimate connection with someone.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I was with a guy for six and a half years and we broke up, and i have been with a girl for three and a half years now(and still going). Just a year or so ago he had raped me. and i keep finding myself getting very angry and emotional all the time. my girl friend and i break up constantly because of my actions and how angry i get. I find myself in a happy mood one minute and the next i am so angry that i am on the verge of crying. i just don’t understand what to do or how to help myself. And i am afraid to go to a real live person face to face because i am not so great at talking out loud. im hoping someone here can help?<|im_end|>

 As you stated, you “just don’t understand what to do or how to help yourself.” You have described the very feelings that should lead you into therapy. There’s no reason to be frightened of therapy. The job of the therapist is to assist individuals who are struggling with life problems. The best advice that I can give you is to seek professional help from those who are exclusively trained to deal with the very problems with which you are struggling.If you had a legal problem, no one would expect you to represent yourself in court. It would be expected that you would seek the assistance of a lawyer. Likewise, when people are struggling with psychological problems, it’s expected that they should seek help from a mental health professional.By waiting to seek help, you risk making your situation worse. Undoubtedly your partner is being affected by your emotional instability and anger, which has the potential to damage the relationship. Please consider seeking the help of a trained mental health professional. If you do so, it would be advantageous to choose a therapist who specializes in working with rape victims.Leave it up to the therapist to make you comfortable and to help you to openly discuss your feelings. Don’t be afraid to try more than one. Choose the one who makes you feel the most comfortable and is the easiest to talk to. Studies show that this will be the most productive therapist for you.Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I think scary thoughts sometime, it’s been happening since i was a kid and ever since i had my daughter it’s been worse. I see a dirty napkin and my mind forces me to think of me eating it, i won’t use dishes or even walk in my own kitchen. I think bad sexual thoughts, but what bothers me the most is that i can’t fall asleep because i make a popping sound with my lips over and over. When i was younger i prayed for 2 years straight because i was scared i didn’t believe in god. When i was younger i would wash my hands so much my skin would fall off, then my mom told me i need germs to be healthy and i stopped washing my hands at all. I think it could be ocd but i don’t know. I worry about every little thing and i feel so depressed because of things that haven’t even happened. But it’s so bad at night because of the need i have to make my lips make a popping noise over and over before i fall asleep. I can’t control it or stop it. I get nail clippers and clip all skin around my fingers and toes off, some parts so much that it bleeds. I get days where I’m so jittery and i feel almost like I’m not really here or like I’m about to die or something is off. I want to talk to someone for help, but nobody understands. When i was younger the problems were so much worse, but ever since i became postpartum they are starting to bother me again. Some things i don’t even want to type anonymously because they are so gross. I just want to be happy but i feel like it’s impossible<|im_end|>

Much of what you have described may be consistent with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or related anxiety disorder. Having recently given birth could have exacerbated your symptoms. However, a diagnosis is only possible via an in-person evaluation by a mental health professional. They can determine what may be wrong and design a treatment plan specific to your needs.You mentioned that “you want to talk… but nobody understands.” That may be true of laypersons. They are not trained to understand mental health problems. However, mental health professionals would understand and they would know how to help you. Choose a therapist who specializes in either postpartum disorders and/or anxiety disorders. Studies have shown that behavioral and cognitive behavioral therapies are highly effective for anxiety disorders. Good help is available.Start by calling four or five therapists who specialize in anxiety and ask them how they would help you. Choose the one with whom you feel the most comfortable and that will likely be your best choice. Your PCP or OB/GYN might provide you with a referral if you ask for one. You might also consult a psychiatrist for medication. The sooner you take action, the sooner this problem can be resolved. Good luck and please take care.<|im_end|>"

I will try and be as brief as possible: 3.5 yrs ago I fell deeply in love with a man who is 13 years my senior. I had never felt this way and neither had he. We were together full time for 1.5 yrs however it was a long distance relationship taking up to 10 hours each way to see each other. We adored each other and wanted to make it work so made an effort to meet up every 2 weeks. The distance took its toll and when I felt ready to move in with him, he suddenly became very scared (his mum committed suicide 3 yrs before I met him and was quite abusive to him when he was a child) and took a step back which caused no end of heart ache. I knew he still loved me however it was simply impossible to continue as we were. Eventually the frustration of being apart caused us to separate. We decided to take a break- not to break up. But he went into denial and although we were in touch most days during the break, he said that he wanted to stay single. I was dying of heartache and 6 months after our so called break met another man who for the first few months became just a lovely friend, consoling me about my break and helping me, eventually the new chap and I started having a relationship although I had mentioned nothing to the first man (love of  my life) as in my head I thought he no longer wished to be together. After some time he found out and told me that he wanted to get back together by which time my trust had flown out the window. The new man was so lovely and kind and fun and all the rest of it but we lacked much sexual intimacy. Fast forward nearly 2 yrs and they are still both in my life, I am in love with both and both are in love with me. I live with the new one but I am dying inside being away from the first.  I have seen him and we both don’t understand what’s going on. Its so painful and I feel so guilty. Sex is still an issue with new man- I love him dearly rather than passionately. Help me please if you can. (From the UK)<|im_end|>

 I would like to offer a perspective that may be helpful in these types of situations. Of course, it is hard for me to know all the particulars, but there is something happening, which involves a lack of intimacy that seems important to highlight.In different ways both men were available and unavailable simultaneously. Your first love was emotionally and physically intimate, but was distanced geographically. When it was possible for that to change — he changed. The second man is available geographically, but not sexually. The red thread is that neither is fully available and, by your descriptions, never have been.This leaves you in the constant position of wanting and not having love. You are living with one and want the other, but you no longer trust the other enough to leave. The constant in all of this is you are drawn to each man’s potential, but not to their reality. By staying in love with both, you keep yourself from being fully intimate with either.The situation is not meant to be resolved, which is what is most likely causing you depression. The illusion is that there is a right choice to be made, but the situation has evolved so that there is no right choice — only more of the same wanting and not having.The way out of this is to understand more about your own process of being with unavailable men. For this I recommend individual therapy. A good relationship therapist will be able to help you sort through both the origin and ways to correct this process.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Sometimes when someone does me wrong I will bring it up to them the next I see them. I’m very bold in my expression I am calm but usually I will be insulting and ask them why they did it. I’m usually quite the ass and wish them the worst luck in life. Simply because I believe that everyone should show some remorse for being rotten. Most people don’t seem to care less and say that I need professional help. I guess my question is do I? When I talk about these situations I’m not talking about simple mistakes. For example a woman I met in a online dating site 7 years ago after 3 weeks of deep conversation suddenly broke all communications and that was it. No explanation. I let it go. But today I saw her on the same site still and basically told her that it was a bs thing to do and that I’m glad she’s still struggling to find love because she didn’t even give me a chance and that’s what she gets for not even trying. She says I should seek help. It’s not normal to hold that kinda anger. Thing is I haven’t thought about her in years. Just suddenly seen her today and messaged her that simply because it would have taken 2 sentences of saying sorry not interested instead of just ignoring someone with no reason. Do I need help? Because this type of situation has happened often in my life.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
You believe everyone should show “some remorse” for being rotten. It would be nice if that were true. Our world would be a different place if that were the case but unfortunately, it’s not. Your solution to this, it seems, is to be equally as “rotten” or abusive to the person who you feel wronged you.The woman who stopped all communication with you had the right to do that. The two of you were dating and she apparently no longer thought you were a match. That is the nature of dating. Undoubtedly, she could have ended it differently. She was wrong to do what she did, however it was equally wrong for you to do what you did. You were both in the wrong.You could’ve treated the woman on the dating site differently. You could’ve asked her why she ended all contact with you. You could’ve inquired about what didn’t work in the relationship, but instead you chose to say something hurtful. You seem to be operating from the perspective that if someone hurts you then they deserve your revenge and abuse.It would be wise to consult a therapist (in-person) about this matter. The two of you can examine these situations in more depth and determine what went wrong and how to have a more appropriate reaction.The more insight you have about this issue, the easier it will be to navigate these types of problems in the future. Finally, I must congratulate you on your willingness to inquire about this issue. It would suggest that you are open to change, should it be necessary. Good luck with your efforts. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My 10-year-old son has been repeatedly stealing. My husband and I have spoken about this with him several times. He always promises us that he will never ever do it again and that he has realised his mistake , but a couple weeks later he brings home something that is not his. He has so far been caught at a grocery store where he was forgiven, stole from me at home to buy few books. All our efforts have been futile. Today he bought home a couple of toys that he stole from his friends. We would like to take him to his teacher tomorrow and make him return the items, but fear that he will be socially scarred for life and worse, he may stoop in to do worse things for us exposing him to his freinds ..

 It is clear that you are suffering deeply. I’m sorry that you’re having such a difficult time living. My heart goes out to you.You mentioned that you were sexually abused twice in your life. The abuse that you suffered very likely has a lot to do with how you’re feeling. It also likely explains why you have difficulty trusting others. You were hurt and understandably you do not want it to happen again. Relationships are difficult. You don’t want anyone to get too close. You are guarded. In an effort to essentially hurt yourself before someone else does, you purposefully harm yourself. It may also be your way of gaining control. What you may be experiencing, at least in part, is post-traumatic stress. Post-traumatic stress is a common response to trauma. People who have experienced traumatic experiences may feel emotionally numb. Some describe this numbness as being almost detached from life.With regard to college, maybe it wasn’t for you or maybe it was. With your emotional problems, it’s not fair to judge how suitable college is for you. You went to college because that is what your family wanted. You view that as something negative but try to think about it from a different perspective. You are learning about what makes you happy; you are experiencing life. Maybe you are meant to be an artist, a musician, a gourmet chef or a college professor. It is the wrong point in your life to come to conclusions about your future career.You wrote that you essentially do not know how to continue with living. I would concur with this statement. You need guidance. Everyone in life needs guidance. You need the help of a wise, competent and knowledgeable therapist who can help you overcome this unpleasant time in your life. You mentioned depression, experiencing passive suicidal ideation, and having panic attacks. What you didn’t mention is whether or not you’ve ever tried counseling. You could greatly benefit from counseling. If you have not tried it, then you have not given yourself an opportunity to improve your life. Life has ups and downs. Your life may be unpleasant now but do not believe that it will always stay that way.I hope you will consider therapy. Please click on the find help tab to find a therapist in your community.

Q: So I graduated high school, by now I thought I’d be a famous musician. Sadly this has not been the case. I’ve lived with my parents for a year doing absolutely nothing but playing games because I can’t afford to do anything else and nobody has been hiring, when I check up with the hiring manager they just tell me they’ll call me if they need me…<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You thought you’d be a famous musician but you aren’t practicing or playing out? Huh? Talent isn’t enough. Becoming famous at anything takes about 10,000 hours of practice and a fair amount of luck. People who make it are those who would play in a closet entertaining the coat hangers if that was the only venue they could get.You won’t find a gig or a job in your room. It’s time to get out there. Find a group of young people who want to play out and start getting together to practice several evenings a week in someone’s garage. Yeah – I’m serious. Make a garage band. That’s how most people get started. Advertise in your local paper for the drummer or bass player or whatever you need and get going. If you get good enough, you can start offering to play out for a “pass the hat” in order to get some attention. Then see how it goes. Lightning might strike and you and your band might get discovered but worst case you’ll have some fun and make some friends and contacts.As far as employment: Haven’t you heard? Volunteering is a way to build your resume and to get the attention of people who can help you find a job. If you can’t make money right now, you can at least get yourself some skills and develop some connections. Volunteer to teach kids your instrument at your local community center, start a gaming club for troubled teens, work at the local food pantry. While you are there, be an active, enthusiastic member of the team. Let people know that you also need paid work and it might evolve into a job. Even if it doesn’t you’ll have more to put on your resume that a high school diploma and a high score on a video game.I agree that you are in no way ready for college. But while you are volunteering and working on your band, you could benefit from taking a course or two at your local community college. Consider taking a class in arts management, or songwriting, or music 101. You will be helping that resume and you’ll be meeting people your own age. It will also help you decide if you want to further your education.Bottom line? Stop the self-pity party and get going – especially if you don’t feel like it. If you don’t do some things differently, nothing is going to be different.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I just wanted everything to go away: I’m 14, and am currently in high school, year 10. As a kid, I was forced to study way ahead of my grade, and my mum used to teach me. Every time I got a question wrong, I used to get smacked with a rolling pin. Or when I made my mother angry, I was smacked, then dragged and thrown into the bedroom. I wasn’t allowed to cry, otherwise she’d punish me more. It was more when I was younger, but I learned not to make these mistakes. I sometimes used to get bruises and stuff. But afterwards, my mother would make it up to me by saying things like “I love you” and “You will always be my cute daughter” and buy me snacks. Otherwise, I enjoyed my mother’s company. But it would confuse me, and still does. The memories sometimes haunt me, flashes of my mother dragging me into a room, and the sinking feeling in my heart as I know there’s nothing I can do to escape. It’s just so confusing. I still don’t know if what she did to me is considered is “abuse”…I know it’s stupid but……it’s so confusing. My father helped me a lot although he was almost always working, he took me outside for breaks in studying and protected me from my mother sometimes. There has always has been two “sides”. My mother’s side and my father’s side. I always had to choose, whose side I was on, but I don’t know. I still don’t know. My parents always fight, then somehow make up, then fight again, and the cycle continues. I don’t know anymore. It’s just so stupid, and I always try not to get involved, but I always get dragged in. I just want it to all go away, but it doesn’t. When I turned 13, I realised I’d drifted off from my father, mostly because he was taking care of my other two sisters, and I was alone. To be honest, I liked being alone. I don’t have to pretend, and I don’t have to act. My mother had also stopped teaching me, she let me have my independence. But since my father was usually out, it left me and my mother alone. She always tries to justify and persuade me onto her side, telling me all these things which I really don’t care about, but it just hurts me. I feel like I’m being torn apart in half. I don’t want to choose a side. Can’t we just live in peace? I have always considered running away, but I have never had enough courage to do so, under the fear that my mother will always end up finding me and scream at me and punish me. I don’t know what to do. I’m sorry for rambling, I’ve never shared anything like this anywhere. Thank you.<|im_end|>

Please don’t apologize for “rambling.” You have not done that. You are simply telling your story. All of those details help me to understand what you are going through.What you have described is abuse. Your mother is guilty of abuse. Your father is guilty of ignoring her abuse. You shouldn’t have had to endure this abuse.In the United States, if a child is being abused, they can be removed from their parents. There are hotlines where abuse can be reported. I don’t know what the laws are in your country but in all likelihood, a similar system exists. Google “child abuse and the name of your country,” you might find the necessary reporting information. Local hospitals, churches or counseling centers may also be able to assist.Running away would not be a wise idea since you don’t want to risk being homeless. Is there anyone with whom you can live, at least temporarily? A family member whom you trust?It was brave of you to share this information. As you wrote, it was the first time you have done so but it shouldn’t be your last. Your next step should be reporting this information to the school guidance counselor or a trusted faculty member. They should be able to help you find the necessary services to remove you from this situation. I hope this answer assists you in knowing how to proceed. Please don’t hesitate to write again if you have additional questions.<|im_end|>"

When I was in the seventh grade I always joked about depression. I never knew how serious it could be. My mother abandoned our family when I was little and got into drugs. My dad has been a single parent almost all his life. In 8th grade I started to realize that it was not a joke, because I had it. I stayed in my room, I drew away from my family and sports, and then one day I cut myself. It was the only feeling I had experienced in quite a while. And then when that became a habit, I stopped eating. I know this is serious and it should stop but I have no idea of how I should tell my mom, who has come back and I thought she deserved another chance. I just recently moved in with her about 4 months and all it’s done is made everything so much worse. I want to go to the doctor and let him help me. (age 15, from US)<|im_end|>

 I’m sorry that you are feeling depressed. Writing in was a great step forward in getting some help, but I agree, you probably need more than just this. I think it was kind of you to give your mom another chance, we all deserve them, but giving someone another chance doesn’t mean you have to live with them. If you were happier living with your father, maybe you should consider going back or at least splitting your time between them.As for getting some professional help, don’t worry so much about telling your parents “why” you need to talk to a therapist, just let them know that you do. The therapist can help you explain the details later. You can tell them that you have been feeling sad or that you have been struggling with some stressful situations at school and you want to talk to someone who can help you.In the meantime, rather than not eating or cutting yourself to deal with your pain, please try to find some positive coping skills. You can talk to friends, exercise, keep a journal, volunteer at the animal shelter, etc. These types of things can help a great deal without causing you physical damage. I hope things improve soon.All the best,<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: 7 years ago I fell head over heels for my kids father. before the kids and I came along he was with his girlfriend for 18+years that he cheated on with me. We had two little girls. After being told that I was the one and I was gonna be the one he will married, he couldn’t picture me being with someone else other then him. Like any women I fell for it.

 What a hard life lesson! It’s generally true that a man that will cheat with you will eventually do it to you. This man isn’t worth your time or your love. Never has been. Never will be. I’m sure there must be some positive qualities or you would not have stuck by him for so long. But now that he has shown the truth of his character, I hope you will do everything you can to put lots of distance between you.The good news is that you are only 31. You have lots of life ahead of you. Learn from this hard experience and look for a man who will love you and only you and who will be the father that your kids need. Don’t waste another second of your love or your time on the old BF. Make yourself available to a healthy guy.If you find it hard to let go, please do consider seeing a therapist. Your self-esteem has taken a major blow. You may need some help and support to build yourself back up again. You deserve it. Your children deserve to have a mother who feels good about herself and who can show them what love and a healthy relationship look like.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

At 18, you don’t need your family to listen to you or to believe you. The only person who has to believe that you need and deserve treatment is you. Instead of spending your energy on arguing with your family, explore how to get the treatment you need. Instead of channeling your pain into self-injury, get help to feel better.Since you were diagnosed, I’m assuming you saw a clinician who is qualified to do it. That person can give you a treatment plan. If you can’t afford to follow up with an individual therapist, there are alternatives. You may find it helpful to take a look at this article.Taking charge is likely to make you feel better. Doing the hard work of therapy now while you are in your teens will set you on a path for a happy and productive adulthood.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My question is of a sexual nature, and I’m a little embarrassed about it. It’s something I keep to myself, but now I’m wondering – do I have a fetish or am I just a S&M freak or something like that? Ok, here’s the thing. The last couple of fights my boyfriend and I had he said he was going to punish me, and teach me a lesson.<|im_end|>

There are many theories about why people are aroused to S/M or Dominance/Submission. Which is the correct one? Are any of them correct? The one thing that we can be very sure of is that historically, sexual arousal to these things goes back as far as written history.Is it a problem for you? Is it hurting you psychologically? You are now feeling some guilt associated with your sexual arousal and that could well be a signal that indeed it is hurting you. A therapist could better evaluate this for you, after a thorough interview with you.The thing that concerns me is that these activities seem to spill over into your non-sexual life with your boyfriend. If it were simply a “game” that you played in the bedroom for sexual stimulation then you would be able to read about and study the lives of millions of people world wide who share your interests in D/S. Perhaps it is a harmless activity that you and your boyfriend engage in for sexual stimulation that only appears to involve normal times. I can’t answer that question through email communication.Millions of people do associate sex with guilt but that does not make it normal or healthy. Not all guilt is a sign that psychological damage is right around the next turn. The guilt can’t be ignored. Please find a therapist with which you can discuss this issue. I hope I’ve helped.<|im_end|>"

This has been an on-going thing for almost my whole life since I was born, my family won’t do anything about it so I’m just in need for advice. My mother has been in a mental hospital before for only a week, due to family issues. Every day, she leaves and comes back and something sets her off, during her episodes she thinks people are watching/talking to her on a voice machine and that they screw with her body… or that my grandparents put her on this voice machine… she also tends to blame me for random things and throws sharp knives away because she thinks my young brother is going to stab us in the middle of the night, when he is NOWHERE NEAR VIOLENT AT ALL, he’s only 3. I am just wondering if signing her up to a mental hospital, or maybe therapy will help it mentally abuses me and will do so my brother once he is older.<|im_end|>

 You are right to be concerned about your mother. She engages in unusual behavior. The only way she could be committed to a hospital for treatment is if she is a danger to herself or to others or if she is unable to care for herself (i.e. gravely disabled). Generally, hospitals are for emergencies.She could benefit from consulting a psychiatrist. Psychiatrists are medical doctors who specialize in treating psychological problems with medicine. The psychiatrist could evaluate her symptoms and prescribe medicine to treat her symptoms.She would also likely benefit from working with a psychotherapist. Talk therapy could help her to distinguish reality from non-reality. You should encourage her to seek help from the aforementioned types of mental health professionals.You might also try family therapy. Family therapy could be very beneficial because it involves all members of the family learning new communication and interaction skills.Generally speaking, no one can be forced into treatment unless they are a danger to themselves or to others. Try your best to encourage your mother to seek help. If she refuses, then you should consider consulting a mental health professional who can teach you the best way to deal with your mother’s untreated symptoms. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I am now a rising sophomore, but am being treated like I graduated elementary school. My mother and I do not understand each other at all. Firstly, we have very different mindsets. My mom was raised in Somalia, so she was a teenager in Somalia. I’m a teenager in America, so when it comes to raising me I just feel as if she doesn’t understand where I am coming from.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You’re right. Your mother doesn’t understand you. But the fact is, you don’t understand her either. Your story is very typical of what happens when cultures collide. Your mother is trying to raise you as a good Somalian woman. You want her to be a middle American mom. Instead of trying to figure out how to navigate the differences in cultures, the two of you are locked in a battle. You are as much at fault as she is. (Relationships do go two ways, you know.) I don’t think she is trying to mold you into a version of herself. I think she’s afraid she is going to lose you to a way of life she doesn’t understand.I suggest you drop your end of the fight. Talk with your mother about what it was like for her when she was a teen. Ask her what was expected of her then. Talk about why she chose to come to America and whether she understood that you would be growing up very differently than she did. This isn’t something to fight about. It’s something to be curious about. Show her that being Americanized doesn’t mean that you disrespect her or her values. Then see if there are some common goals you can work on together.This will take some time and patience on your part, But if you take the high road and show her how mature you can be while you discuss these difficult issues, I suspect she will start to bend. You have time. Really you do. If you work on this gradually, you may be able to salvage your relationship with your mother and have a more typically American rest of your teen years.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

about 4 years ago, I was diagnosed with both dysthymia with major depression, and post traumatic stress disorder. My mother left not long after. she was abusive and convinced my dad to be abusive. I spend most of my free time with my grandma, who lives about 25 miles away. since I am blind, I either get a taxi there or someone drives me. While talking with my grandmother sometimes, she acts like my mental health issues are nothing to worry about or be careful of. she is a wonderful person, yes, but she can be judgmental and opinionated, 2 things that almost always set me off. For example, she’s of the mind that you can get over dysthymia like she did with her major depressive episode. She does not seem to hear me when I try to explain what the doctors have told me, saying things like “what to hell do they know?” and claiming my mental health diagnoses are a “fashion in medicine”. I feel that she will understand my feelings, but I do not know how to talk to her about them. She really is the only family member who cares about how I feel. She has a friend who has dysthymia+mdd, and often complains about how negative this friend is when she’s not around. I wonder if she does this about me. when I ask her, she says no, but of course she would. is there a way to make her realize I am sick and that no one is making it up, it’s not just going to go away or I’m just going to force my way out of it?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 My guess is that your grandmother doesn’t accept talking about your diagnosis because she loves you and doesn’t want to think anything is wrong with you. You’ve said she is stubborn and opinionated. Yet you continue to argue with her. Why? Why is it so important to convince her that your are ill? Why not focus on the good relationship you apparently have with her and enjoy your time together? With all you’ve been through, you need comfortable time with someone who loves you a whole lot more than you need to win this argument.Many people do recover from depression and PTSD. It takes time and attention but it can be done. It’s not about “forcing yourself.” It’s about taking care of yourself. Work on your mental health issues with your therapist. Read what you can about your diagnoses and figure out ways to support your own healing. Eat right, exercise, and find things to do that give you joy. Start and end each day by counting your blessings. It will help. Really.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I have been depressed lately not just sad but depressed. I have lost 60 lbs since February. I used to be very active no I just sit in a chair for 7 hours a day then lay in bed for the rest of the day. I don’t talk to any one. I don’t do anything. I literally feel worthless anymore. All of my in-laws have picked my husband’s ex over me, he doesn’t stand up for me. I have started cutting. I told him I didn’t want to live anymore and that I don’t plan on being here by Christmas. He just yells at me and tells me he doesn’t know what to do. My psychologist wants me to see psychiatrist and I have been trying since September, but every time I try to find one they either don’t take my insurance or don’t take new patients. I feel like I am at my rope’s end. Like it’s not worth fighting any more. Is it better to go into a hospital and tell them you need help or let someone see your cuts and forcefully get admitted or just call it quits since no one gives a good dang anyways and just make the big cut?<|im_end|>

 You seem to be exhibiting symptoms of depression. People with depression often feel hopeless. This tunnel-vision view of their lives makes it difficult for them to see that things can change and do change. Their subjective reality is limiting and incorrect.Objectively speaking, depression is a highly treatable condition. Many people have reported that psychiatric medications for depression are immensely helpful. If you were taking psychiatric medication, your symptoms might have improved. I would encourage your trying to see a psychiatrist and not stopping until you do. Have you tried your local community mental health center? Most community mental health centers have psychiatrists who are able to see every client who wants help, regardless of whether or not they have health insurance.The most moving examples of why suicide is wrong can be found in a New York Times article called The Urge to End It All. The article recounts the lives of individuals who attempted suicide and survived. The individuals featured in the article reveal that they never really wanted to die. They just wanted their pain to stop. Attempting suicide was their maladaptive response to their stressful life circumstances. Each person featured in the article was grateful to have survived and now realize that their problems were solvable. None of them have thought about suicide again. You should read that article.The direct answer to your question is you should seek help. If you feel that you cannot keep yourself safe, then go to the emergency room. They will provide you with immediate assistance and treatment. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 I’ve been told to have anger management issues and I have been noticing so. The reason is because whenever get angry I completely explode and everything I’ve been holding in suddenly comes out. Situations would be: 1)Having a fight with my boyfriend or jealousy I would feel like physically damaging him AND myself (although I have never done so but I have said very hurtful things); 2)When I am repenting from something and I can’t manage to express it I get angry and become even more vicious taking it out on everybody; 3)If I cannot handle my emotions I get very angry. 4)Whenever I am angry my hands begin to shake nervously and the vains on top of them pop. My anxiety becomes umbearable and I get short of breath, I beggin to cry and get nauseos. As a consequence to all these things I lose control and throw things around breaking them. I wonder if maybe this has to do with my childhood? My father was this way and I could never express my feelings until I would rampage.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I would concur with those who believe that you have an anger management problem. Your anger is clearly an issue that needs to be dealt with. You have difficulty controlling your behavior. Though you have not physically harmed another person, you have engaged in verbal abuse. The risk is that you will, in the future, no longer be able to control your physical aggression and will harm someone.Your anxiety also seems to be out of control. You described being out of breath and feeling nauseous. Those symptoms may be indicative of a panic attack.You asked whether your behavior could have been learned from your father. The answer is yes. We learn our problem-solving skills from our parents and other role models. The good news is that learned behavior can be replaced with new, more appropriate learned behavior. This typically requires therapy. A therapist can teach you more appropriate and healthier problem-solving skills. Therapy would be the most efficient way to tackle this problem. The find help tab, at the top of this page, can assist you in locating a therapist in your community.You may also want to consider an anger management support group. Many of those programs can be very effective. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I was with my ex girlfriend for a year and half.  A few months before our breakup she moved a few states away and we tried to maintain a long distance relationship.  I did not go with her, because I was nearly finished with college.  At the time it seemed like a spur of the moment decision on her part to leave the area, but she really wanted to move out.  When she was away, we talked about moving in together and other promising things about our future with one another.  Ultimately, she met someone out there and left me for him.  I was angry and upset and we talked about the situation at length. She said didn’t want to be with one person for the rest of her life.  I told her we should stop talking and said maybe we could be friends down the line.  A couple of months passed and she contacted me telling me heart felt things and insulting her own actions in regards to how we split.  I was excited to hear from her, but I told her it wasn’t a good idea for us to be talking to one another being that I still had feelings and she was still with her new boyfriend.  But, to my fault, I ended up contacted her a few times; sending casual “hi, what’s up?” emails.  She came back home to visit for two weeks and we ended up hanging out a lot.  She told me she still loved me and we were intimate and sexual with one another.  Emotionally though she seemed very back and forth about me and her current boyfriend.  Also she seemed guilty one moment for hanging out with me and then was alright about it the next.  Obviously she is confused and giving off mixed signals, and I feel like I’m being led on.  We have talked openly about the situation before but didn’t really come to a conclusion.  She told me she is uncertain if she is going to continue living there or if she is going to live back in this area.  Either way, I know this situation isn’t healthy for me and I should definitely disengage from it.  But I don’t know what I should or shouldn’t say or if I should even say anything at all and just walk away from it.  Thanks for your help.<|im_end|>

 Thanks for your email. Letting go of a past love relationship can be very difficult, especially when you felt a strong emotional and sexual attachment. I’m glad that you can see that holding on to this relationship isn’t good for you and that it’s time to take responsibility to change.The underlying question for you to answer is why you are reaching out to and trying to engage in a relationship with a woman who moved away from you, found another boyfriend, clearly states that she doesn’t want to be with one person, and is willing to cheat on her current boyfriend with you. Are you afraid you won’t find someone else to love you? Are you trying to get her to choose you over her current boyfriend?She isn’t the only one who’s confused and sending mixed signals. You have both sent mixed signals to each other. From what you’ve described, you aren’t far enough down the the road to “be friends” without becoming intimate, so I suggest that you set strong “no-contact” boundaries with your ex and stick with them. No contact means no contact. It’s time to start spending your time developing yourself and seeking a relationship with a woman who wants to be in a committed relationship with you, instead of holding on to an unhealthy past.Take good care of yourself!Julie Hanks, LCSW<|im_end|>"

 For years i hated my sister so much. there are things she does that i really hate. my family is divorce. My sister and i are with my mother. She had surgery years ago due to stress. I listen to everything my mother says, i fix the house when it comes to plumbing, computers, TV, networking, bathroom tiles, ceilings, etc. i work every hard and i really dont ask for anything and i respect others. My mother tells me not to yell at her or tell her what to do and my mother can not discipline her because she is worried she will have surgery again. I cant do anything because i dont want to stress my mother as well. therefore my sister can do what ever she wants.<|im_end|>

 I’m so sorry you are under so much stress. Somehow you’ve been made into the man of the house when you’re only 18. Your sister is only part of your problem. She couldn’t get away with any of this if the adults in your life didn’t let her. The only comfort I can offer you is that you are learning how to be a responsible adult with many skills and your sister is learning how to be a spoiled brat. I don’t know if everyone expects you to take care of things because you are the oldest, the boy, or both. But, whew! This is really too much to ask of a young guy.Don’t waste your time trying to change your sister. From her point of view she has no reason to change. Her relationship with your mother is their relationship, not yours. Bow out of any attempts to discipline her. It’s not your job. It is only stressing you. And it isn’t doing any good.Instead, focus on your own relationship with your mom and the other relatives in the family. Since you shoulder so much, they probably have no idea that you are stressed out. Be your most mature self and ask for some help. Encourage your mom to get some counseling so that she isn’t stressed by sis and so she can learn new ways to handle her. See if your dad is willing to take on some of the repairs. He may be divorced from your mom but he’s still your dad and it’s reasonable to ask him to help you.Then start to figure out what you want to do with your life and take some steps to get there. You’re in your senior year. I hope you are letting yourself enjoy this last year of high school at least some of the time. It’s also your time to think about what you want for your life after graduation. Sit down with your guidance counselor and take a look at your options. Not interested or ready for college? There are many options that could take you away from home for awhile so that you have the chance to grow. You might find it helpful to take a look at my article “Are You Ready for College? Alternatives for the Unsure” that is in our library.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I have a sister that is in her thirties and I think she has a mental disorder. She is a paranoyed person. Things that to me is stupid she worries about. For example we were doing remodilng in our home and we were working on the bathroom and we took the bathroom door off and she came to my house and had to use the bathroom. It was just her and I there and she had to use the bathroom. She went through and shut all of my bedroom doors and checked to make sure that no one was in the house because she was afraid that someone would see her in the bathroom. She is also a depressed person and real hard to get along with. She has a daughter,her name begans with the same letter as mine and when we are all together she gets our name mixed up she calls her daughter by my name and just keeps doing it. My mom babied her and always has. All of my brothers and my one sister know she has a problem but we are not sure what it is. She drives all of us crazy,its hard to be around her. She is always asking my brother if he is mad at her because she thinks that he isn’t talking to her enough. She always wants pitty. She is a single mother and doesn’t work and expects her family to keep her. She has trouble taking orders at jobs because she gets mad. She got into trouble one time when she was in her twienties for hitting a co worker with a six pack of pop in the face. My brother told me when he was a little boy she used to bite the blood out of him and he would tell my mom and my sister would denie it every time and my mom would beleive her. My mom just doesnt relize she has a problem and I think she does. She told me that she went to the doctor last week and they told her that they thought she had bipolar. She doesn’t belive it. Im tired of my mom making excuses for her and defending her when she is wrong.<|im_end|>

I cannot give you a diagnosis for her but I can say that in life there are things you can change and things you cannot. You have attempted to change your mother and sister. At this time, realize that your efforts are not achieving much success. At some point you should begin to disconnect yourself from those people whom you cannot help, so as to minimize the negative impact they have on your life. Begin to unplug emotionally and interactively. You can’t let someone who is in denial degrade the quality of your life.<|im_end|>"

I am 25 years old and I have been with my boyfriend for almost a year and a half now. We met at work and we spend almost every day together. For the most part, our relationship is very healthy — we balance each other out very well. He brings out the character in my personality and we both help each other think critically. He makes me laugh a lot and we’re always there to support each other — he’s a great companion. We argue about once a month (the time of the month for me) over silly issues but we’re generally very good about solving them.<|im_end|>

 Three years ago, your boyfriend and his ex were maybe 20 or 21. They made some poor decisions when they were very young and suffered a tragedy together. It’s now part of the fabric of who they are. Nothing you can do is going to change that. Your boyfriend has done his grieving for the baby and for what might have been and moved on as best he can. But as with all important griefs, when it is put in front of him, some of the intense feelings still come over him. Of course he cries. That’s normal and appropriate. It only shows that he is a good, caring man who has had a loss. You wouldn’t want him to be anything less.Loving him means appreciating that and understanding that his past is, of course, always going to be a part of your life as well as his. If you do make a future with him and decide to have children, your pregnancy will not be his first. He will have memories of another. He will probably be extra concerned about you during your pregnancy and extra worried about whether your baby is okay. The birth of his first child with you will be inevitably colored with feelings from the loss of the other child. He will probably love the children you have together all the more because he understands as most of us don’t just how precious life is.The problem with dating grownups is that they have lived a life before you met them. So have you. Each of us is the sum of our experiences (both good and bad), including our experiences with others. If you can’t tolerate these ideas, then you shouldn’t be with someone who has been with anyone before you. As you get older, that will become more and more of a challenge though. For that reason, I do think it would be helpful for you to think about doing a little therapy. You have what you say is a wonderful relationship with a caring man who loves you enough to put up with your really low comments and accusations when you fight. At this point, it’s your insecurities that may sink this relationship, not his past. You risk throwing away a perfectly fine relationship because you are preoccupied with things you can’t change or accept. You need to figure out what that is about and resolve it if you are ever to have a happy and relaxed relationship with any partner. I hope you agree that you owe that to yourself.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I have been diagnosed with depression but, lately I have come to realize I have many more problems, that I didn’t even realize till the other day..I am a compulsive liar. I will lie about anything, even simple things for no reason. Sometimes I won’t even realize that I have lied until later on. And now looking back in my life I have always done it. It’s like an addiction. I can’t stop no matter how hard I try. I will lie about the stupidest, pointless things..for absolutely no reason.<|im_end|>

 I find two things very encouraging about your letter: one is that you recognize you have a problem with compulsive lying, the other is you want help with it. There are some people who lie and have no desire to change. For them, lying is a way of life. It is something they do on purpose because they are trying to project a certain image. With few exceptions, many of those individuals are not able to be helped. Usually that is because they have no desire to be helped. They would not want to see a therapist, and feel that they have no reason to change. That is not the case with you. You want help. You want to change. You don’t like how the lying has negatively impacted your life and the lives of others. You have lived with its consequences and you are tired of it. It is a burden for you, not something that you use to further yourself in life. From my perspective, there is hope for you.You say that you cannot stop lying. You may not be able to help yourself but a therapist could. The therapist could also help you with the other issues you are experiencing such as your extreme mood swings and your marital problems. Borderline personality disorder is treatable but it requires hard work and a dedication to improving your life.One interesting aspect of your letter is that you feel as though you are “split in half.” Some research has shown that individuals who have difficulty with compulsive lying have described a similar feeling. The good news about the research is that it shows that lying is a problem that can be dealt with in therapy. That is very encouraging.Here’s a link to a website where you may be able to find a therapist in your community. I hope that you will strongly consider therapy because it can help you. You are worried that a doctor will not believe that you have borderline personality disorder. That fear may be unrealistic. What matters most is that you find mental health professionals who are able to help you solve the problems in your life. The first step is making the call for an appointment. That should be your next step. I wish you well and hope that you are able to find the help you need and deserve. Thanks for writing.<|im_end|>"

 I don’t think you need insight. You need to believe what your own wise inner self is telling you. This guy may be wonderful in many ways but he is in no shape to give you what you want in a relationship. He has major healing to do. On top of that, you say he is racist and addicted to media. Those are two more good reasons why he isn’t the guy for you.Meanwhile, you have issues of your own. Yes, you are expecting too much from him. In fact, you are expecting too much of anyone older than 15. Most adults your age have a past. Most have loved and lost at least once. It’s unlikely you are going to find someone for whom you are the first and only. That doesn’t mean you can’t find someone to love you deeply and exclusively. It does mean that you need to stop competing with your own imaginary ideas about a person’s past.I hope you will make an appointment to see a counselor. You do deserve to find love. You do deserve to have less anxiety about attachment.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Depression as I feel very lonely and upset all the time even though my life is perfect.

 You seem to be experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety but to know with certainty, you should undergo an evaluation with a mental health professional. He or she would be in the best position to determine a definitive diagnosis.Anxiety and depression are two of the most common mental health disorders. They also tend to go hand-in-hand.Your feeling dizzy with headaches and neck pain might be indicative of anxiety but could also be the result of a medical problem. Medical problems should be ruled out before considering psychological causes.Contact your primary care physician about your symptoms. He or she could assess your symptoms and refer you to a mental health professional.I receive many questions from people who say that they’ve suffered with psychological problems for many years, sometimes their entire lives. It doesn’t have to be this way. Anxiety and depression are both highly treatable conditions. Study after study has showed that medication and counseling can effectively reduce or eliminate anxiety and depression symptoms.Your mental health is just as important as your physical health. Depression and anxiety symptoms diminish the quality of your life. Without treatment, you will likely continue to experience a diminished quality of life. If you’re willing to participate in treatment and are working with a competent mental health professional, you should expect a significant reduction in your symptoms and thus a better quality of life.

From a 16 year old girl in the U.S.: I have been struggling to control my emotional responses, usually crying, since as long as I can remember. I’m not sure what triggers it, but I am certain it only happens with any adults, including my parents. Whenever the conversation turns to anything but small talk, there is a chance that I could become tearful. I’ve seen it also occur when a teacher jokingly makes fun of me or even another student; even though I am aware of their lightheartedness and even may find the joke funny, I still get teary.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Sometimes it is very difficult to determine what is cause and what is effect since they often go in a loop. Does your teariness cause depression and insomnia or does insomnia and depression cause you to feel fragile around adults? Do you feel especially fragile with adults because you know they will react with concern? Or do you long for their concern but don’t want to admit that you need their help?Whatever is the case, you don’t need to live with this. You say it’s been going on for years. Isn’t that long enough?I think it’s time for you to talk to someone who can hear the whole story and offer you the support and help you really do need. You made important first steps in admitting that you do have a problem and by writing to us here. Now, please, take the next step toward self-care and healing by making an appointment with a mental health counselor who can give you regular attention and help.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From a teen in the U.S.: i’m positive that i am depressed. i’ve had countless episodes where i have felt empty/numb inside and shut everyone out as well as having lost interest in many things. i’ve only recently started cutting myself, but i’m working on stopping the habit.<|im_end|>

 Thank you for writing. You are not bothering me. Your problem isn’t trivial. You have written an articulate letter in which you’ve done your best to both present your problem and be sympathetic to your parents’ beliefs. Many, maybe even most, people do need some help following a traumatic death. That situation plus the fact that there is a family history of depression are enough of a reason for you to see a professional.I think the place to start is with your medical doctor. I don’t know if there is a medical component to this or not. If there is, treatment can be offered. Of equal importance, though, is that physicians can often do what a teen can’t. Your doctor can tell your parents that you need an evaluation for depression. She or he can also suggest some changes in life style that would benefit you at this stage of your life.If you parents are not open to having you see a doctor, think about other adults you trust and they respect who might be able to help you have a calm and clear discussion with them. Is there a relative who can give you support? How about a church elder?At 17, you should be getting ready to leave home. Your isolation is part of your problem. You need more social contacts in order to become more socially secure. If your parents are committed to home schooling, find other ways to get out with people your own age. Join something. Participate in a sport. Volunteer where other teens are doing good work. Maybe find a part time job that will both get you out into the community and let you save some money toward future schooling or a place of your own.You have made an important start to your adult life by taking care of yourself by reaching out for some help here at PsychCentral. Please find the courage and strength to take the next steps.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

When I started my job at a grocery store 3 months ago I would have really bad anxiety. I was generally an anxious person before but being a social environment only made it worse. I’m very bad with people and putting on that happy/cheery customer surface attitude. It got to a point at times I was choking back tears because I was so anxious. My sister did let me have some of her prescription anxiety medicine at first, which is know is wrong. I also took kava root and 5-HTP on top of that. I was more comfortable being really tired all day than being anxious. Since then, I have been self medicating with a supplement called Phenibut and on occasion 5-HTP on top of that. Phenibut is said to be effective for social anxiety and can help bring you out of your shell. I take the maximum serving size listed (which is roughly 1060mg). after I got used to it it has been very helpful. I’m not intimidated by my male coworkers anymore, I am comfortable answering the phone and I can talk to customers without fear. This is something that works for me. Obviously there is no therapy attached to self-medication, but if it is effective, does that still make it wrong?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Self-medicating can be dangerous. Phenibut has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. It has not been studied in people so its effects are not well known.A major concern is its abuse potential. Tolerance can build quickly. The obvious danger is that you are taking a drug that has not been extensively studied. Its safety is questionable.The FDA has “serious concerns” about drugs without required FDA approval. The FDA requires a rigorous, evidence-based system of drug approval in which both safety and effectiveness must be demonstrated. It is the standard by which drugs are deemed safe in the United States.I would advise against taking unapproved drugs, especially when there exists the potential for abuse. You don’t know the effects of the substances that you’re putting into your body. It’s an experiment, one that has the potential to damage your mind and body.Dietary supplements should only be taken under the supervision of your healthcare provider. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I have been wondering this for some time, especially in the last few months- Am I a sociopath or am I crazy..? For starters, I had behavior problems as a child, which developed around the age of 7. I was in and out of mental hospitals and group homes from the time I was 7 till just before I turned 10. I don’t have these behavior problems anymore, but I have been described as a compulsive liar, a thief, a “sneak”, and as having no regard for others- all of which is true.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 It is difficult to know what may be wrong. You seem to recognize that there are potential problems and writing this letter may mean that you are interested in correcting them. I find that to be encouraging.It is possible that the problems you have described are the result of your lack of a connection with a stable parent. I am assuming that you didn’t have that, given your chaotic childhood. Not having a stable relationship means that you may have never experienced an emotional attachment and thus would have difficulty connecting with others.Your inability to feel emotions may be the result of a defense mechanism used to psychologically tolerate living in mental hospitals and group homes as a child. For the majority of people, such experiences would be traumatic. One way to cope with trauma is to disconnect emotionally from those traumatic experiences. This happens unconsciously and can result in an overall lack of emotion with regard to many areas of one’s life. Perhaps that is what has happened to you.The issues you have identified can significantly and negatively impact your life and your ability to develop relationships with others. It is human nature to desire social relationships and without those connections, you will likely be unhappy. My recommendation is to seek counseling. Therapy may be able to correct many of your problematic behaviors and improve your ability to feel and express emotions. The “find help” tab at the top of this page can assist you in locating a therapist in your community. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From a teen in the U.S.: I’m going to start this with I don’t know how I feel or if anything is wrong with me. I haven’t been diagnosed because I’m afraid of telling my family. I thought i had depression and anxiety because I had many of the symptoms, but lately I’ve been doubting that (because of intrusive thoughts). I also have intrusive thoughts that disturb me a lot (sexual, death, fear of faking it) and they make my life so hard.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
I’m very glad you wrote. Many people are under the impression that a diagnosis of OCD requires both obsessions and compensatory compulsions. That simply is not the case. Yes, it is possible to have OCD with only the intrusive thoughts. And those thoughts can include the additional intrusive thought that you’re faking it.One of the characteristics of true OCD is that the sufferer is aware that the thoughts are irrational. But the person can’t “reason” themselves out of them.If that is the case for you, I hope you will talk to a counselor who specializes in OCD. The good news is that OCD can be managed, usually by a combination of medication (at least at first) and coaching in “thought stopping” and other techniques.I’m sorry you don’t feel you can talk with your family about the problem. Maybe it would help if you showed them your letter and my response. Or maybe it would help to talk to a school counselor or another adult you trust who can then talk to your parents. Sometimes parents are more likely to listen to another adult they respect.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I was diagnosed with depression and sever social anxiety in January 2010. I graduated college in May 2010 and soon after landed a job. I then took myself off of all medication (without doctor consent). I thought I had beaten my depression!<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Thank you for asking us. I am sorry you are having so much difficulty. I have 3 recommendations.First, since you came off an antidepressant without the advice of your physician I would definitely reconnect and have this reevaluated by him or her. Sometimes individuals can do well for a time, but then life circumstances can cause a recurrence.The medicine obviously was working– so this would be the first step. If you can’t afford this please use the outpatient clinic at your local hospital. They will work with you on a sliding scale. This is very important. The medicine is likely to be the most immediate source of relief.Secondly, I would recommend both individual and group therapy for coping with the depression and social anxiety. Research shows that the combination of psychotherapy and medicine is the best treatment for depression. Again, connect with your local hospital. You can also get information for groups in your area that are free of charge from the National Alliance on Mental Illness, NAMI.And of course we have our Psych Central online support.Finally I would encourage you to look into mindfulness meditation, or event Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy MBCT to help soothe yourself prior to going to bed.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I am eighteen years old and have yet to see a psychologist, although I’ve been dealing with depression for 5 years now. It has gotten worse over the years, but at the beginning of my sophomore year of high school I had developed a strong fear of going to school, for reasons I don’t even know myself. I had plenty of friends and my classes weren’t hard at all. I would wake up in the mornings crying uncontrollably and having panic attacks. Then normally I would blacked out and wake up on the couch around 6 pm. My depression got worse after that and I stayed home for a couple months without seeing any of friends. What could have caused these fears or whatever it is that I had?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I don’t have enough information to explain your panic attacks. Sometimes people have panic attacks when they feel out of control. People can also experience them after a life change or a loss. Did you experience trauma? Did you lose someone you love? Did you recently move? Was there a change in your life? Were you being bullied at school? Did something embarrassing happen at school? Try to think back to what was happening in your life prior to the panic attacks. Though panic attacks seem to strike out of the blue, there is always a cause.Blacking out for long periods of time is unusual. It’s not necessarily consistent with panic attacks or panic disorder. If you are still having blackouts, they should be investigated by a medical professional. It’s wise to rule out physical causes.Determining the origins of your panic attacks is less important than getting professional help. Pinpointing the cause of your panic attacks is not a prerequisite for beginning treatment. Leave that to the professionals. You also have had depression for the last five years. It’s time to seek help. Effective treatments exist for both depression and panic disorder. By delaying treatment, you are prolonging your suffering.I would recommend being evaluated by a mental health professional. He or she will gather details about your psychosocial history and attempt to determine what is wrong. A therapist might uncover the origins of your panic attacks but most important, he or she can assist you in developing the necessary coping skills to treat your anxiety and depression. Therapy is the ideal place to learn these important skills. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: Recently, my mom’s gotten into a bit of a saddened state. You see, she loves acting, but everything going on in her life has restricted her from doing anything close to it. The city we live in has no interest or location specifically for acting and her job leaves her no time to do any kind of acting if any possibility arises. She and my step-dad run a wedding photography business. For the sake of privacy I won’t give any more details than that.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Your mother is lucky indeed to have such a caring son. You are doing your best to be supportive but you may not understand what is really going on for her. It is rare that all doors to an interest like acting get closed. My guess is that the issues around her acting career are a distraction from something else that is harder for her to face. Rather than deal with whatever it is, she places her negativity and anger at the theater.True to her theatrical nature, your mother is dramatically (and maybe unnecessarily) ending her acting career. The fact is that your state (indeed, your city) has many community theater groups. There are also numerous young people’s theater companies that count on adults like your mom to help kids learn the theater arts. If your mom can’t find a company to her liking, she could start one. She knows how to run a business. She knows how to act. So I have to ask myself why she isn’t doing something to keep her love of theater alive?I may not understand the total situation, it’s true. I can only suggest that situations are rarely as bleak as you seem to think. For some reason, your creative mother isn’t using her intelligence and creativity to find a way to fit at least a part time acting career into her life. It could be that she got some negative feedback and she is giving up rather than trying harder. It could be that she is making some kind of point with your father or someone else. It could be that she is really tired of it but finds it easier to go down in a blaze of glory than to just let acting fade out of her life. Or it could be something else entirely.The only way to know would be to ask her and she may not want to burden her teen-aged son with the truth of her discouragement. You could talk with your dad to see if he has an insight that would be helpful to you. If not, all you can do is tell your mom how very sorry you are that she is so discouraged and then get on with your own life. She is the one who has to deal with whatever she is dealing with, not you. All you can do (and it’s a lot) is let her know that you love her and have confidence in her ability to solve her problem.I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

I’m starting to think there is something wrong with who I am. People seem to act coldly and distantly towards me. The group of friends that I call myself a part of don’t seem to want to be around me – I only see them at school, they often make plans to go out as a group, which I only find out about after they have already been done. They openly talk about ‘the fun they all had’ over the weekend in front of me. They don’t contact me outside of school. I have tried making new friends, but people tend to treat me weirdly when I talk to them and this has made me nervous about initiating conversations. I think it’s my fault, somehow, that they see something about me that I don’t realise and this makes me undesirable to be around.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 To answer your question directly, there’s nothing wrong with who you are. You may be experiencing depression. You are beginning to dislike yourself. You see yourself as “ugly” and “undesirable.” You are blaming yourself for the behavior of others and assuming that you’re the problem in all situations.People with depression don’t think highly of themselves. Their view of the world is negative and pessimistic. They tend to see themselves as a burden, believing that others would be better off without them. That line of thinking can lead someone to isolate and withdraw from the social world.Your assessment of this situation may be inaccurate. Depression clouds judgment. You could benefit from therapy. A therapist would objectively analyze your life and determine what treatment is most appropriate. A therapist will assess your social situations, your friendships and the way you interact with others. He or she will also determine whether or not you have depression and if the symptoms are interfering with your relationships and social situations. It’s important to proactively begin treatment when distressing symptoms emerge. This problem can be easily corrected with the assistance of the right therapist and treatment. I hope you will consider professional help. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Hi, I don’t know if I have a mental health issue or if it’s just normal behavior. I’ve been going out with my partner for over 6 years and throughout I’ve been suffering from bad mood swings, which I often just put down to my personality. It has really started to affect my relationship and I can’t be surprised because I know I can be a nightmare at times. It has got to the point where we can’t have fun together anymore, a simple joke and I get angry and can’t snap out of it. I know when I’m doing it, but can’t help myself. I am also quite jealous, without reason, and thats another thing I can’t control. I obsess about stupid things and even though I want to stop I just can’t. My partner has stopped telling me things about their everyday life because they are afraid I might react badly. I often find myself crying and upset about small meaningless things and just feeling sorry for myself. I’m unsure if this is just all my own personality or if I should seek help? I love my partner with all my heart and cannot imagine my life without them in it but I feel maybe I am holding them back. I don’t want to be the reason they’re unhappy too. My partner reckons I should seek help but I don’t even know where to start? Would really appreciate some advice. Thanks.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You inquired about whether bad moods are just part of your personality. The answer is no. They are highly treatable. It is not normal to have this strong of an emotional reaction.Your sadness, anger and jealousy are clues as to what might be wrong. Jealousy stems from a lack of confidence. If someone doesn’t feel good about themselves, they may worry that their partner might leave them for someone better. Thus the constant vigilance and concern about the possibility of your partner leaving.We all get angry from time to time but frequently feeling this way might indicate unhappiness with some aspect of your life. Often, sadness and anger go hand-in-hand.These problems are correctable with counseling. If not corrected, you risk losing your relationship. If you want to keep your relationship, then you must improve your mindset. Counseling is the most efficient way to make a positive change. It would also show that you are open and willing to change, and willing to do whatever it takes to improve the quality of your life and your relationship. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: My daughter’s friend’s Mother is acting strangely. I found out that she wants my adult daughter to call her “Mom”. She takes my daughter’s side when my daughter and I argue, and has since my daughter was a teenager. She competes with me. An example of this right now is that my husband and I are taking my daughter on a 3 week trip this summer. I found out today that she has planned a trip now for this summer for her 2 daughters and mine. My daughter does not tell me these things. I have learned about this through the grapevine.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
What a tangled situation. You characterize the woman’s behavior as competition with you. I think it is far more complicated than that. On the one hand, she decided to be a rather absent mother and made no objection to you doing things that a mother usually would for her daughter. If she struggles with mental illness, she may have thought it was the best way to love her daughter at the time. On the other hand, she may feel some sadness, guilt or shame about having done so. I’m guessing that maybe she is trying to make up for lost time with her own daughter by planning the vacation. She may also be attempting to balance her daughter’s relationship with you by attempting to be closer to your daughter.It makes sense to me as well that the other girl wants to visit you with your daughter and does things like opening the mail you send. After having been a part of your family for years, she may not be able to understand or respect a new boundary.This may be going on at a very unconscious level. It could well be that neither the mother nor the daughter are being purposeful in what looks like hurtful behavior. They may not know how to have a more usual and closer mother-daughter relationship when you’ve been in the mothering role for so long. The daughter may not know how to ask you to continue being a surrogate mother without feeling like she is betraying her biological mom.One challenge now is for you to find a way to move out of the mothering role without making the girl feel abandoned. Another challenge is to not take offense at the other woman’s efforts to “adopt” your daughter. Arguing with her will only stress you and it is unlikely to change her.Your daughter knows who her mother is. It’s fine to remind your daughter that it isn’t helpful to recruit the other mother into any disagreements the two of you have. Shifting your relationship to a more adult — adult one now that she is a young adult means working things out directly with each other, not pulling someone else into problems.Because this is so complicated, you might find it helpful to talk to a family therapist about how you can shift your relationship with the other family and affirm your relationship with your own daughter. An experienced family therapist will be able to give more informed guidance and support than I can.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: My daughter is currently ten months old. Her legal father (L.F.) is not her biological father (B.F.). L.F. has played a very active role in raising her. He has taken on a paternal role since day one, and she has grown to call him dada. My daughter has never met B.F. However, L.F. has now decided that he does not want to be a part of her life.

 I’m not an expert on loss for a child so young. I can imagine that she will experience her LF’s absence for a time since he has been so involved with her.I’m guessing that he is leaving due to conflict in your relationship with him. The effect of the loss of her “dad” may be outweighed by the loss of the stress in the house. A positive and nurturing relationship with you is the most valuable protective factor while you both go through this difficult transition.That being said, it is not the baby’s fault that the two of you can’t be a couple. Since he’s been a good dad to her, why not explore with him the possibility that he would continue to have a role in her life. He may have talked about rejecting her in anger with you; not because he really means it.A caring father figure is good for any child — as long as it is a real long-term commitment. If the two of you can separate any negative feelings about each other from your love for the baby, you might all benefit.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 The alcohol might be causing her symptoms, but it’s impossible to know that while she is actively drinking. In order to identify the source of the problem, she would need to stop drinking and undergo a mental health evaluation.Encourage her to check into an inpatient rehabilitation center. Once she is more stable, they will be in the best position to review her symptoms and determine the source of the problem.It’s dangerous for her to continue drinking. The fact that she loses consciousness is concerning. She should not be drinking but if she does and her symptoms reappear, take her to a hospital. Her becoming psychotic and losing consciousness are potential emergencies. Don’t attempt to treat her on your own. Professional help is her safest and best option. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From India: My boyfriend has severe OCD problem. He does not pose a problem to me but I have noticed behavioral problems in him owing to this which have destroyed his family, relations and career.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 The most important thing he can do is see a local professional for advice. Some people are able to confine their anxieties to a certain place or certain situations. They manage their worries by eliminating what’s worrying them. That is called “compartmentalization.” That technique works well when the fear is focused on something specific and rare. For instance, if a person is afraid of blue parakeets, he can avoid being around blue parakeets. It’s harder to compartmentalize when the fears extend over many issues in many places — as is the case with your boyfriend. A local professional can help determine whether your boyfriend is able to compartmentalize his OCD to his current location. If not, he needs to understand that he can’t manage the problem by hiding in his room and avoiding life. Instead, he needs treatment to help him learn skills for managing his fears so he can manage his life.What concerns me most is that you indicate that he isn’t willing to engage in his treatment. The OCD is clearly interfering with his life and relationships in significant ways. It is not likely to go away without treatment.If he won’t take his treatment seriously, you have a difficult decision to make. Are you willing to spend your life with someone who becomes increasingly isolated and unemployable? I hope the two of you will have a very serious discussion about this.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 The moment you suspected that something was wrong, you sought help for your son. You are also spending a great deal of time researching his problem. You are doing all the right things.I would concur that his delusions are concerning. They are unusual. Schizophrenia rarely occurs among children. At this time, he may not meet the criteria for schizophrenia but it is important that his symptoms are evaluated. You should consult a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist may suggest medication to reduce his symptoms or as a precautionary measure to help prevent the development of a full-blown psychotic episode.People can experience symptoms of psychosis as a result of serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Psychosis can also be brought on by drug use, fever, organic brain disorders, dementia, and on very rare occasions, parasitic infections. You may want to have your son evaluated by a neurologist to rule out a physical disorder.Finally, you should check with local hospitals and universities to determine if they have a first-episode or early psychosis program. These programs typically offer highly specialized evaluations for individuals who are in the early stages of schizophrenia or who are experiencing psychosis. Many “first-episode” programs also offer psychoeducational programming to patient’s families. Massachusetts General Hospital has a First-Episode and Early Psychosis program. Similar programs also exist in other states.Generally speaking, the sooner that a person receives treatment for psychosis, the better the outcome. It seems that you’re doing everything you can. He is fortunate to have you in his life. You are keenly sensitive to his symptoms and needs. The early help that you can help to facilitate has the potential to make a major positive difference. I wish you and your son the best of luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Q. Are hallucinations in any way a projection of either the unconscious or the subconscious mind? To state an issue that occurred in my own family, when a family member underwent a surgery, her sodium levels dropped. She is one of the rare cases where low sodium levels induces hyperactivity and hallucinations. Although we have been told that the reason for her behavior is rooted in biological causes and changes, I would like to know the impact of such changes on the subconscious mind and whether there is any information unknowingly projected out by the individual through hallucinations. The aforementioned family member, post-surgery, looked at a fan and starting scolding it as if it were a person. Yet when asked what/who she was scolding, she answered saying that she was scolding the fan itself.<|im_end|>

 You ask a question that tests the very limits of science. Anyone who gives you a simple answer is guilty of being simpleminded. Really, what you are asking is what is the nature of reality and the place of consciousness within that reality.It would be nice to think that reality is obvious and that science, for the last hundred years or so, has shown us a blurry picture and that over time, through the advances of science, that blurry picture simply becomes more and more in focus. Another way of saying this, would be to say “we know what it is but we don’t know all of the details. With the passage of days and weeks we discover more and more of the details.”But the truth is the exact opposite of that statement. The very best scientific minds recognize that reality and the place of consciousness in reality is exceedingly difficult to determine and is likely to be not at all what we thought it to be. Put very simply but quite inadequately, it is the difference between Newtonian physics and quantum physics. Strange things happen in quantum physics and we have known this for 100 years. Experiments have been repeated year after year, decade after decade, yielding the same results and though it would be convenient to ignore these results, they cannot be overlooked.Many books have been written about the findings of experiments in quantum physics and additional books, have been written summarizing these results and expounding upon their meaning. It would not be the slightest exaggeration to say that the very best scientific minds of our time are primarily focused on these issues. They are scientists that are nationally recognized as being among the very best, internationally recognized as being among the very best and some are Nobel prize laureates.One of America’s best scientists, Robert Lanza has written two books on the subject. The first was titled Biocentrism: Robert Lanza’s Theory of Everything and the second was titled Beyond Biocentrism: Rethinking Time, Space, Consciousness, and the Illusion of Death. You can watch Ted talks and see Dr. Lanza explain his understanding of this subject. He is not alone in his beliefs; many great minds concur. To summarize their position in the simplest of all possible terms, “it ain’t simple.”I can’t give you a simple answer about your family member. We know the drugs can be psychoactive, which means that they can enter the brain and distort its functioning. With hallucinogenic drugs like LSD, people have said that they can hear colors and see sounds. If your loved one returned to normal functioning, after this hospital event, problem solved. After that, any deeper probing enters an area of science that is simply not understood.The very best minds in science are studying the nature of consciousness and being. It is not a simple subject, but it is not beyond the understanding of the reader of my words.If you read both of Robert Lanza’s books, don’t expect to be an expert but you will have an understanding. Experts study for years and if you want to be an expert you also will need to study for years but you don’t need to be an expert to be impressed with the work of these scientists and to gain whatever understanding that you desire.I hope that you don’t think that I’ve avoided your specific question. I have instead answered in the best way I possibly could. To know the effect of the unconscious and subconscious upon the conscious mind, one would need to know about the true nature of the unconscious and subconscious and conscious minds and quite honestly, no one really knows. Since I do not, nor does anyone else with whom I am aware have a complete understanding of these areas, then anything is possible. Without knowing all, who can say what is not a part of the all?The important thing is that modern science has hopefully returned your loved one to a happy, normal existence. How to return someone to a normal existence or state of being, is thankfully practiced every day in therapist’s office across the world and if I may add, with great success. Let me leave you with this. Understanding how to return someone to a “normal” existence is a far different question than that of the true nature of existence. Good luck, my friend.<|im_end|>"

 In spite of everything, it seems that you and your parents love each other very much. You continue to follow their rules and do well academically even though you are so unhappy. Your parents are doing their best to protect you from a world that frightens them. I admire you for trying to figure out how to get past this impasse without resorting to sneaking around or a major blow-up.You didn’t mention any theory you might have about why your parents are behaving as they are. Did something bad happen to one of them or a relative when they were young? Are they from another culture where this kind of protection of a young girl is expected? Are there reasons for your parents to think that where you live is unsafe? If I were seeing your family, those are questions I would want to explore with them. They don’t seem mean; just way, way too over-protective for a young girl living in America these days.The problem with your parents’ strategy for keeping you safe is that you aren’t learning how to take care of yourself. Someday, you’ll have to drive on your own. Someday, you’re going to be the one to make the decisions about what is and isn’t right for you. Your folks would keep you safer over the long haul if they found a way to gradually let you loose into the world so that you could develop the strength and confidence to deal with it on your own.I think you probably need some adult help to convince them. I suggest you talk with your school guidance counselor or your clergyperson if you have one. Even the family doctor or a favorite teacher can be helpful in situations like this. Look for another adult who can be sympathetic to your parents’ concerns and at the same time help them understand how important it is to teach you your own safety skills.Expect to start gradually. For example: They might be more comfortable letting you sleep over at a girlfriend’s house if they were introduced to her parents. They might be more comfortable with you seeing boys if it were in a group, rather than dating someone special at first.I very much hope that you can find someone to help you mediate with your parents. You all sound like good people struggling with how to best help you become an independent adult.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From Spain: I am gay man who is 28. Before I came out as gay, I was meeting people via a dating app secretly. And one day I started doing something disgusting which I fully regret now. I came from a good family who have always loved me and supported me, but what I did would definitely shock them. One day a man wanted to meet me, however he was 70 and I was 22! I said no, but he finally offered me a lot of money and I agreed to meet. We did meet for at least 3 months for several times and even though we never had proper sex, I did let him do things to me.<|im_end|>

I am so very glad you wrote. It’s been over 5 years — long past time for you to forgive yourself and move on.I don’t think there is a person in the world who at one time or another did or didn’t do something they regret. Making mistakes is part of how we learn who we are and what we stand for. We often remember such things in order to remind ourselves to not go in that direction again.In your case, the “reminder” has become a daily poison. It’s as if you don’t quite trust yourself to be the man you want to be. Please take a good look at how you’ve been living these past five years. My guess is that you have reason to feel good about yourself. You left behind a behavior that you didn’t like then and don’t approve of now. That’s something to be very proud of.I hope you can be proud of the man you’ve become. I doubt very much that you need to keep beating yourself with regret in order to be that guy. If you find that you can’t keep it in perspective, then please fine a counselor who can help you with it.I wish you well.<|im_end|>"

I don’t like being around them either and would much rather be on my own. I don’t even respond to friends that try to contact me most of the time.

 This is not at all what 16 year olds want to be doing with their time. Your teens are a time to hang out with friends and to develop the self-discipline and motivation you need to go on with your studies and to think about what you want to do with your life. I’m so very sorry that you seem to be unable to enjoy your family and friends lately.The first thing to do is to see your doctor for a physical check. It’s possible that there is a medical reason for your withdrawal and over-sleeping. Hormone imbalances are often the cause. Another possibility is that your sleep cycle is so disrupted that it is affecting your mental health. If you aren’t getting 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep every night, do talk with your doctor about how to get yourself back into a normal routine. At your age, especially, the body needs restorative sleep every night.I also hope you are getting some physical exercise at least 3 – 4 times a week. Being active will help you feel better physically and mentally. If you don’t enjoy sports, you can always take a brisk walk, or go for a run. When you do, the body will produce endorphins, a natural body chemical that lifts our spirits and our sense of well-being.If you are sleeping well, eating right, and getting some exercise and your doctor tells you that you are physically okay, then it’s time to see a mental health professional. It’s possible that you are suffering from social anxiety or depression or both. In that case, some therapy and maybe some medicine can help you get back into life.<|im_end|>"

Are there ways to avoid letting chronically angry and verbally abusive people affect your mood? I have a bad-tempered family member that I cannot avoid. She used to yell at me a lot and got violent sometimes. Since I stood up to her several times, she has not dared to attack me directly. Instead, she goes around yelling, swearing, slamming doors and will raise her voice to make sure I hear it if I am far away or in bed. I don’t mind curse words in general, but find the intent and vehemence of her swearing offensive and it is degrading to have this constantly directed at me.<|im_end|>

You are likely to get as many variations of answers from therapists as there are therapists. I have a clear and unambiguous approach I will share, but it is highly biased and based on my experience. Please get some other opinions and choose the one that best suits your needs and personality. This suggestion and perspective may just not be for you.There are three important clues in your story that lends themselves toward my suggestion. The first is the why is called positive deviance. Of all the ongoing belligerence by this person the one clear thing that worked and worked extremely well was when you stood up to her. You met fire with fire, and she stopped. This is an important clue about how to go forward.Secondly, you mention that you have tried to be rational and that this has not affected you, but then explain how it has directly affected your depressive reaction and ability to concentrate. What I’m suggesting here is that a rational approach doesn’t work. In fact, I’ll go further in saying that this approach is actually part of what is making the problem worse.Finally, you say that you are being falsely blamed and are victimized by her rage. Accepting this in any form only allows it to continue. This, in addition to my other two points, leads me to my suggestion for hanging the dynamic.You have stopped having any needs from this person and are now in orbit around their need to be angry, rageful, and blaming. It is time to start making your needs known and be highly proactive, direct and confronting.When you need time to work and need quiet, I’d let her know straight away before you begin that you need her to be quiet, not other you, or leave the house, while you are working. I’d encourage you to make this a clear need.Secondly, I’ll also encourage you to respond directly when she is mouthing off, blaming, or being out of control with her rage. Your job is to assert your own needs in the relationship. Tell her every time she is out of mine, belittles you, blames you, or disrespect your needs. She has no boundaries with you except the ones set when you stood up. Stand up for yourself regularly. Become highly assertive with her. It has worked because people like this family member only get their power through intimidation. Once you are no longer intimidated, they fold.All this having been said there are three typical causes for someone with the kind of profile this family member has. Often there is alcoholism or abuse in their history and programs like AA might be helpful if they would attend. There is also the possibility of certain types of personality disorders that can cause this. Typically, a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist can help with this diagnosis. Finally, there are medical conditions that can be underneath all this and a neurologist may be the best professional to help.If my suggestion about your speaking up doesn’t work after a month or so I’d suspect it may be one of the other three causes and follow up with those professionals would be in order.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: My husband and I have been married for 3 years and we’ve been close friends for 8. We have been through so much together and he has been the one person in my life I’ve always counted on. Our relationship has always been one filled with nothing but love, openess and trust in one another. However, in the past year we’ve fallen on hard times.<|im_end|>

 It’s true that your relationship was tested while you and your husband were going through a rough time. A woman who made him feel special gave your husband a way to feel a bit better. But the good news is that he didn’t let himself be swept into an affair. He stayed loyal to you.If anything, I’d say you have more reason to trust him now than you ever did before. It’s easy to stay trustworthy when it isn’t tested. It’s much harder, and ultimately more powerful, to remain trustworthy when temptation and feelings are in the way. Once he understood the impact on you, your husband apologized and took positive actions to remove the temptation and the reminder to you of what happened.In my opinion, the best thing you can do is give that man lots of appreciation and support and love. Forgiving him for a lapse when things were hard and appreciating his responsiveness to your feelings are the most important things you can do to ensure that he will continue to be worthy of that trust.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Hi! I’m an 18 year old girl and about a year ago I started researching different disorders and relating to symptoms.The thing is, every time I found I fit a diagnostic criteria for certain disorder, mostly cluster B personality disorders, instead of trying to deny the symptoms I started acting and thinking even more accordingly and felt proud of it.Now I’m getting a bit depressed because I feel like I have no idea who I actually am and what I actually think as I’m always trying to mold myself to fit the criteria.Acting disordered makes me feel good because it makes people notice my symptoms and it gives me reassurance, in a way.<|im_end|>

 The practice you have described is unusual. It’s as though you are attempting to have a disorder in order to gain attention. Perhaps you feel that you have to fake symptoms in order to get those around you to notice you. I am wondering what symptoms you have faked, how you accomplish this and how it is received by others. In what ways do they respond to you and in what ways does their response make you feel better?Having a desire to be ill is a characteristic of people who have factitious disorder. Factitious disorder is a condition in which an individual person pretends as though he or she has a physical or mental illness. Individuals with this disorder have a strong desire to present themselves as being injured or ill. They will deliberately create a set of symptoms for the sole purpose of gaining attention and sympathy from others. They may create symptoms that do not exist or lie about their experiences.It’s important to note that I cannot know with certainty if you have factitious disorder or if you have any disorder. Diagnosing psychological conditions requires meeting in person with a mental health professional who conducts a thorough, psychosocial evaluation.In all likelihood, one’s attempting to appear sick is to gain attention. You may believe that it’s necessary. If that is the case, I take this as a sign of your unhappiness. My recommendation would be to consult a mental health professional who can explore why you feel the need to fake illnesses in order to gain attention. A therapist can teach you healthy coping mechanisms and problem-solving skills to replace your maladaptive behavior.You may want to ask your parents to assist you in finding a therapist or you can ask your primary care physician for a referral. Try several therapists until you find one with whom you’re comfortable. Therapy has helped many, many people and it can help you too. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Hey guys, so today I went to see a psychiatrist for the first time and I told her about all my fears and insecurities especially my fear of schizophrenia. I told her my fear of schizophrenia at least 5 different times and each and every time she told me I don’t have it,then she went on to prescribe Wellbutrin and klonopin she told me to try this and she’ll see me in 1 month. I’m just asking u guys if I can trust her opinion she didn’t run any test for schizophrenia so I’m iffy if she called that right. What do you guys think? Have any of u been on these meds before? Do they help with panic or fear? Also, i’m kind of scared of taking meds. I’ve read stories of bad experiences on meds and that they even made everything a lot worse. I really need them my anxiety has never been worse than what it is now but i’m scared that they’ll make everything a lot worse.<|im_end|>

 The fact the you have many fears and insecurities, especially about developing schizophrenia, may indicate a potential anxiety disorder. It’s not uncommon for highly anxious people with health phobias to be particularly concerned about the development of schizophrenia. They tend to see schizophrenia as being the most severe of all mental health disorders and thus it frightens them the most.There is no official “test” to determine if one has schizophrenia. Typically, a mental health professional will review your symptoms, gather an extensive psychosocial history and make a determination about whether or not you meet the criteria for a particular disorder. The symptoms that you provided to your psychiatrist were likely checked against the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V), the accepted classification system for mental health disorders. It is the manual used by mental health professionals to diagnose disorders.There are very specific symptoms that must be present in order to receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia. These include: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior and negative symptoms (i.e. flat affect). If an individual does not have at least two of those symptoms, for a significant portion of at least one month, then they would not receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia.If it is realistic to believe that you may have schizophrenia, then it would be advantageous to receive a second opinion.People with anxiety disorders are stressed and worried about many things. That might be why you are frightened of taking medication. You may have focused too much of your attention on the potential negative aspects of taking medication. Many people with mental health disorders are greatly helped by medicine. Medications can be especially effective when treating anxiety disorders.My recommendation is to try the medication your psychiatrist has prescribed and keep careful track of how it makes you feel. Your doctor will likely start you on a low dose of the medication. Changes may be made depending upon how you react to the medication and how it affects your symptoms.It’s important to note that when beginning a new medication, you may experience negative side effects but in most cases they quickly subside.Anxiety significantly reduces the quality of one’s life. You may be greatly helped by taking medication. Therapy could also be highly beneficial. I hope this eases some of your fears. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I’m going to be seventeen in a few months, and I have been dealing with mental issues for years now. I battled self-harm, suicidal tendencies, hatred and severe aggression towards myself and everyone else, etc. for years. My parents are unaware of that because I never wanted to burden them with personal issues, partially because I believe they’d most likely just tell me I was being too dramatic. As a minor, I had no way of getting professional help so I did the best I could at trying to help myself. Through lots of hard work and patience, I managed to get self-harm and suicidal thoughts under control (although I do slip up sometimes) and I became a much more positive person, but I still don’t feel like it’s “right”? I don’t feel normal; I believe happy people don’t feel this way. I feel like I may have just gotten good at faking the positive attitude because it feels so artificial at times—it takes very little for me to start feeling extremely miserable and hopeless. Am I overreacting or should I seek help?<|im_end|>

 I would agree with your statement that happy people don’t self-harm and think about suicide. Those are signs of someone who is suffering and who may be depressed.Many teenagers feel as though their parents won’t help them or won’t be sympathetic to their situation, but they are often mistaken. You are making assumptions about your parents reaction, but as you have stated, you are viewing these issues through the lens of “misery and hopelessness.” This view is likely clouding your judgment.If you were having physical health problems, you would probably not hesitate to tell your parents. For instance, if you began to experience an intense, sharp pain in your stomach, I highly doubt that you would keep it a secret. When the pain didn’t subside, you would quickly recognize that something might be wrong and ask for help.Just like a sharp pain in your stomach may be a sign of an underlying medical problem, so too might your self-harm and suicidal tendencies. The desire to self-harm, suicidal thoughts and feelings of hopelessness require professional and prompt treatment.Depression is highly treatable, but you must first inform your parents and ask for their help. Give them the opportunity to help you. At this point, you haven’t tried. It’s your job to bring this matter to their attention and it’s their job to assist you in accessing the proper treatment. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I’m in a long term relationship, over 10 years, with my partner. We are a lesbian couple. From the begining of our relationship she has been telling me that she would be a bad partner. I always refused this. She is a wonderfull partner and I love her dearly. I also feel that she does. We do have some difficulties but usually are able to talk it through. Now, she has a loss of desire for me. Our sex life is almost inexistant.<|im_end|>

Before the two of you settle on the idea that there’s something psychologically wrong with her or that the two of you are a mismatch, I hope your partner will consider having a thorough medical workup. There are many physical problems that can cause a lack of libido.I’d hate to think that she has missed out on the warmth, relaxation, and intimacy that comes with a close sexual relationship with a loving partner just because she has an endocrine imbalance or some other undiagnosed and untreated problem. I strongly urge the two of you to ask your friends for the names of doctors known to be sympathetic to lesbian concerns. You need a doctor who will take the time to figure this out.If it’s not a physical issue, then you may just have very different sex drives. And that’s alright — most couples can navigate these differences with understanding, listening, empathy, and compromise. If that doesn’t work, it may be that sex is a core compatibility issue for you, and less so for your partner. Things to think about — and talk about with your partner to help figure it out. A couples counselor may be helpful in a situation like this too.Don’t give up, but do pay attention to these issues and not bury them in the sand. They need to be adequately addressed in order for the relationship to continue to thrive and grow. Good luck.I wish you both well. <|im_end|>"

 Oh my! You reached out for help and someone called you “melodramatic”? I don’t think so! I don’t think you are oversensitive, overemotional, or looking for attention. Anyone who truly understood how difficult it is to live inside your head wouldn’t dream of minimizing your feelings with labels like that. You are scared because it is terrifying to feel this out of control.It’s not appropriate for me to make a diagnosis on the basis of a letter. All I can legitimately do is tell you that what you are reporting is consistent with a diagnosis of Bipolar I. Please seek out a mental health professional and get an evaluation. If I’m correct, there are medications that can help control the intensity and frequency of the mood swings. Some talk therapy will help you learn to recognize when you are headed for a difficult period and will provide you with some skills for taking care of yourself.Unfortunately, I’m not familiar with what’s available in South Africa to give you specific directions for finding help. Often a medical doctor or clergy members are good people to ask for recommendations. I hope you will follow through and soon. This is hard on both you and your daughter. You both deserve more stability and less drama.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 My husband and I have been together for almost 10 years and have one child. We are very openminded and compatible sexually, though our sex life has been through some ups and downs as we have grown as people and experienced child birth and child rearing. The first few years of our relationship, we did some wild things sexually, such as public sex, group sex, voyeurism, etc. We both enjoyed ourselves and were equally involved and responsible for our actions. During and after the pregnancy and birth of our child, however, our sex life went through some drastic changes, and we found ourselves with some sexual issues to work through. One of these issues was my newfound disinterest in our old wild ways; motherhood had turned my viewpoint on it from fun to irresponsible. We have gotten over most of the awkwardness that made its way into our bed, but now we are presented with a somewhat „gray area‰ issue. Over the past year or so, my husband has been visiting sexual video chat sites and broadcasting himself in various sexual states, most of the time masturbating, in both public and private online communications. At first he did this secretly, until I found out in a very startling way; I investigated the website that kept appearing in our computer‚s browser history on my phone at work, and was shocked to find a live public video feed of my husband fully aroused. After some obvious conflict over the discovery, we discussed it, and he told me that he missed having our „wild sex life‰ and that this helps fulfill that need. He asked if I would participate, and I agreed in hopes of helping to satisfy his sexual mentality. We broadcast ourselves having sex online a few times, having up to 1000 people watch, which completely turned my husband on and completely turned me off. I decided I wasn‚t going to join him again due to the uneasy feeling it gave me which kept me from enjoying myself. Ever since, I have known in the back of my mind that he still does this, and have gotten up in the middle of the night a few times to find him masturbating and video chatting publicly or with females who are at least scantily clad, if not nude and masturbating themselves. When I confront him about it, he says he has a public sex fetish and needs to fulfill it, believing that it helps keep him „faithful‰ to me since I am no longer interested. (Something you should know about my husband; he is a popular musician and is often confronted with opportunities for sex at shows, but I am confident that he hasn‚t cheated on me). It is obviously a disturbing experience to get up and find him doing this, and although he is not physically cheating, I still feel hurt and disrespected on these occasions. I basically want an outsider‚s point of view on whether I should accept this as part of the man I fell in love with and married, reject it on the grounds of how I feel (although I have a hard time with the thought of leaving him over it), or if we should try to work out some sort of compromise. I would like to come up with some way where he can feel fulfilled and I can be a part of it, without making me uncomfortable, but haven’t been able to (not asking you to figure out what that would be for me, just mentioning it). Thank you very much for your time and help with this issue.<|im_end|>

 Thanks for writing to us.There are several things that I want to point out that are good. First, this situation has now become an open conversation between you and your husband. In every couple there is ongoing negotiation as people shift and change their needs. The two of you have begun this processs of trying to balance things out. I think the fact that you were willing to experiment with taking part was a good effort. It didn’t work for you, but that doesn’t negate the experiment. That you tried to do this together is where the power is.That is my point. It isn’t what you do, but rather the fact that the 2 of you are trying to come up with a solution together where the value is. The connection through the experimenting with ideas is where the relationship is made. The process of processing and experimenting your decisions together is what will be important.You are a creative, dynamic couple. Use some of that creativity to try some variations that honor both of you.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Okay, so I’ll try to make this short and concise. I have these people (really they’re more of voices) in my mind, and they all have names and personality traits and even different hand writings, and when I think about them, I can picture exactly what they look like. Sometimes, I’ve even seen them in my dreams. They have conversations, sometimes amongst themselves and sometimes with me. They “take over” my body when I get stressed or anxious, or when they want to do something. When it happens, I typically can’t control it. Sometimes I can try to, but it doesn’t always work. But, when it happens, I don’t entirely dissociate. Most of the time, I can still see and hear everything going on. It’s almost as if I’m doing these things, but I’m also not. They usually say and do things that I would never even consider. It’s like someone is just controlling my actions and I can’t really do anything about it. But sometimes, either when I’m very anxious and stressed or when they don’t want me to know what they’re doing, I DO dissociate. However, when this happens, I typically can remember some of what happened. But the way I remember it is strange, when I first “wake up,” it’s like a polaroid picture developing. The memory of what just happened fades in slowly, but a lot of parts are usually blurry. Sometimes, one of the people in my head will fill me in on what happened. The first time I ever spoke to one of them was this past December, but it didn’t seem strange to me, I liked the company. And looking back, there have been a few things that lead me to believe that they’ve been around much longer than that. The biggest reason why I question the possibility of DID is that I don’t remember having any traumatic experiences. I really don’t remember any of my childhood before the age of 8 or 9, besides a few random moments, but I assume that if something traumatic happened to me, I would either remember parts of it or my parents would know about it. I had been seeing a therapist for depression not too long ago, but she seemed to disregard it all the first time I told her. The second time I brought all this up, she said we would talk about it more, and then I never saw her again on account of my parents abruptly ending my therapy sessions without even telling me. Anyway, I was wondering your opinion on this? I hope I’m not being any trouble, and thank you!<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 A: Thanks for writing in with your very detailed question. Although I have personally treated several clients with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), there are still many mental health professionals who are very skeptical of this diagnosis. The DID literature reports that clients are often misdiagnosed for several years before getting an accurate diagnosis, therefore leading to the appropriate treatment.I’m glad that you have been in therapy and I’m glad that you were persistent in bringing your symptoms and concerns to the attention of your therapist. However, I’m very concerned that your parents ended your treatment abruptly and it makes me wonder why. I hope that you will be just as persistent with them and request to return to therapy. In some states, minors can receive a certain number of sessions even without parental consent. Since you are nearly an adult, this might be an option for you if your parents refuse to support you in continuing counseling.Even though DID has been linked to early childhood trauma or abuse, in my experience, some clients don’t have any memory of the traumatic events until further along in therapy (and some never remember exact details). Sometimes our mind does what it needs to do to protect us and sometimes the traumas occurred before we were old enough to form concrete memories.I would suggest that you start keeping a journal about your experiences and symptoms, ask other trusted adults (in addition to your parents) about your childhood, and get back into counseling. You are still young, so getting help now regardless of diagnosis, will help you learn coping skills and improve the quality of your life. All the best,<|im_end|>"

 If he remains his own guardian, then your options are limited. He would have to agree with any plan that you attempt to implement. Without legal guardianship, it will be difficult to force him to live in a facility or institution.Ultimately this is a legal question. You should contact attorneys who specialize in guardianship and mental health law. The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) can assist you in locating legal help. Two other helpful resources include the Treatment Advocacy Center and The Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law. Use the search terms “mental health law” and “legal guardianship” to learn more about this specialized area of law.A psychiatric advance directive may also be appropriate for this situation. Psychiatric advance directives are legal documents that allow competent individuals to document their psychiatric treatment preferences and leave specific instructions in advance for their mental health care in the event of a psychotic episode.Psychiatric advance directives are primarily designed for individuals with a serious mental illness who anticipate future periods of inability leaving them unable to make rational decisions due to the recurrence of a psychotic episode. They allow individuals to appoint surrogate decision-makers to make decisions on their behalf, should a psychiatric crisis occur, and if he or she is not able to make logical, competent decisions about treatment.Contacting an attorney who specializes in these matters will help a great deal. I wish you the best of luck.<|im_end|>"

I don’t really know how to start this, but there is just almost constant voice in my mind that is always putting me down. Every time I make a mistake, even if its as simple as forgetting a word in my speech (I compete in speaking contests) the voice will pop in and say ‘You’re so stupid, no wonder no guy will ever love you or want you’ Its always telling me that I’m ugly, worthless and stupid.<|im_end|>

 There are many reasons why you may be hearing voices. People sometimes talk to themselves and that is completely normal. People with psychotic disorders also hear voices and those voices are often critical. It is impossible to tell over the Internet the origin or seriousness of the voices you hear.From your letter it does appear that the voices expound upon your own self-doubt. You may simply be amplifying your own doubt, worries and fears in the voices that you hear. However, you should be evaluated by a psychotherapist to more fully understand the nature of the voices.It is critically important for all people to not allow false thoughts to exist within their minds. In other words, it is critically important to only believe in what is true or real. For instance, you have allowed yourself the false thought that since your mother abandoned you she didn’t want you. I don’t know what’s true in your case or why your mother did abandon you but it is foolhardy to conclude that she abandoned you because she didn’t want you.In many, many cases where a mother gives up or abandons a child, it has absolutely nothing to do with how much the mother loves or wanted her baby. Sometimes giving up a child is the ultimate act of love by a mother because she knows that she simply cannot give the care to the baby that she desires and wants for her baby. Sometimes the mother is in poor physical or mental health. Sometimes the mother is desperately poor and wants a better life for her baby. Perhaps the mother was forced by her family or her religion to give up the baby that she so desperately loves.The reality in your situation is that you simply don’t know why your mother gave you up. And those are the thoughts that should fill your head. You should be thinking “I don’t know why my mother gave me up and I may never know.” You should not be thinking, “she gave me up because I was worthless.”In complete honesty, you have no idea why your mother gave you up. Most likely, she gave you up for her own personal issues. Perhaps she was too young, too stupid, a drug addict, a cult member, too weak to stand up to those around her and countless other reasons that reflect on your mother and not on you. You and all other people need to realize that we cannot believe in that which is not true. You cannot believe that you are worthless since your mother gave you up. You simply don’t know why she gave you up and you cannot come to a conclusion that you cannot prove to be true.The tragedy of false thinking is that it can hold you back in life. People who don’t think highly of themselves often significantly underestimate their abilities and may never realize their true potential.The main problem with negative false thinking is the risk of becoming your own enemy. One attempts to improve their life yet is faced with the constant false thought that they are no good. You can learn to change your thinking to be more in line with reality. In fact, that is the basis of cognitive therapy. Cognitive therapists assess an individual’s thinking, identify cognitive distortions and then aligns it with the truth.I would recommend seeing a psychotherapist. Therapists specialize in helping individuals with the very problems with which you are struggling. Negative thinking also may be a sign of depression. Therapy could help you immensely and significantly improve the quality of your life. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I would like to begin by saying I have never taken any drugs nor am I on any medication of any sorts. I believe my problem began, or the earliest attack I can remember, was when I was five. I was sleeping soundly when I woke myself up out of nowhere. I only caught a glimpse of a giant spider making its way under my covers. I was able to both see and feel the spider crawling in my bed and over my legs. Needless to say I spent the night in the comfort of my mother’s bed. They scattered themselves considerably throughout the next few years of my life. They stayed at the same terror level, rats, snakes and such showed themselves. However, recently they have become more and more consistent and more and more vivid and elaborate. Not only am I able to see them and feel them, it has escalated to actually hearing them. I have seen everything from bugs covering the wall to a shadow person standing next to me. If you need examples, trust me I have many, many more. I have recently expressed my concerns with my family doctor and he dismissed me quite quickly and I feel he did not take the time to diagnose me properly. I was wondering if these are normal, simple hallucinations not to be alarmed about or something worse. Please help me!<|im_end|>

 It is difficult to determine why you are having night hallucinations. Hallucinations can be an indicator of a psychotic disorder. Psychotic disorders include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, psychosis disorder not otherwise specified, and several others. Though hallucinations are associated with psychotic disorders, it is an unlikely possibility in your case. The main reason is because your hallucinations only occur at night. In addition, there was no mention of other symptoms that are indicative of a psychotic disorder.A second possibility is that you have an undiagnosed medical condition.The third and most likely possibility is that you may have a sleep disorder. Some sleep disorders have symptoms that are similar to those that you have described. To determine whether you have or don’t have a sleep disorder would require a sleep study. Your primary care physician can refer you to a sleep disorder clinic.Even if your doctor did not take you seriously the first time you discussed your symptoms, you should attempt to discuss them again. Be persistent and be adamant about your desire for help. Being persistent will likely motivate your doctor to help. If your doctor continues to ignore your concerns, then see a different doctor.In addition, it is important that your parents know about your symptoms. If your parents spoke to your doctor, the doctor would likely take your concerns more seriously.It is important to evaluate the problem and then to find the right treatment. That process begins with speaking to your parents and again with your doctor. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Ever since I’ve come back from a long vacation over the summer, I feel like my whole life is falling apart. For one, I was cheated on by my somewhat boyfriend by my best friend, and I did not get any sympathy for it. Also, my best friends don’t like me that much any more because a friend of theirs claimed I was talking behind their back, and I was not. I don’t have anybody to talk to because who do you go to if you don’t have friends, and I’m too embarrassed to talk to my family. I’m not that close with them. Every day I feel worse and worse and I don’t want to be around anybody, but at the same time, want to be with someone. I feel as if nobody in this world likes me and if I were to leave, nobody would even notice or care because I don’t have a lot of friends. The way the everything has been going, I’m starting to believe, myself, that I’m a terrible person. I don’t know how to be happy anymore. How can I be happy if I don’t even know what it looks or feels like anymore. I’m I just being paranoid or am I legitimately depressed because I feel absolutely hopeless? I need advice on how to improve my life…<|im_end|>

 You are experiencing a difficult time in your life. It will not always be that way. It is important to keep remembering that.Feeling depressed makes sense in light of your recent breakup and your difficulty with friends. Many people would feel the way that you do, especially if they had no one to confide in. I would encourage you to speak to your family. You have nothing to be embarrassed about. Everyone has experienced difficult times in their lives.If you feel that you cannot speak to your family, then consider going to the school guidance counselor or seeing a therapist. The latter option would likely require you to inform your parents about your depression. Many teenagers are frightened to ask their parents to see a therapist but they shouldn’t be. If you developed an unfamiliar rash, or a terrible cough, would you feel embarrassed about asking your parents to take you to a doctor? Probably not. The same logic applies to mental health problems.Parents often want to help but can’t when they don’t know that a problem exists. It is important that one asks for help when it is needed. Otherwise, the risk is prolonged and unnecessary suffering takes place. Don’t hesitate to ask for help. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From India: My parents have subjected me to physical harassment ever since I can remember. They tell me they love me and care about me but they continue to do so. I’m about to enter college and this hasn’t stopped. What makes it worse is that I am a girl. I was dealing with it until the other day my mom pulled me by my shirt almost that I choked and led me to my room where my dad was present. I tried to escape but my dad pulled me by my legs several times that my body aches still. I tried to get out but he tried to remove my clothes all while my mom was still present. I don’t understand what to do. There is no one in my house who still loves me anymore. I stopped eating and no one even came to check on me. I did have suicidal thoughts before but then I realized it’s my life and I can’t let other people control me. I don’t understand what triggered the outburst. I was in my room just doing my own thing. This has to stop. I am just like any other human and feel that I deserve love. Have a sibling and I love him. But this whole thing has put me in a bad light. I desperately want to leave the house but I’m not an adult and do not have the financial requirements. After a few days I am sure my parents will come and console me but nothing will ever erase this whole situation, which I’m sure ill never, forget. It’s becoming increasingly hard to live in this place. I don’t have that many friends either. I don’t think this will ever stop. No one believes that my parents are wrong. There was a time when I would silently take all the beatings. But now that I’m older I started to hit back. I deeply regret it but I don’t want anyone to think that they could get away with tormenting me. I’d hate to grow up and be such a bad example to my kids. This year wasn’t that great in terms of my grades and that caused my parents to resent me even more.<|im_end|>

  The work for you is to get out of your home, if you are not out already. You identified yourself as being in a university. This is good — not just for the personal growth possible — but also to get away from a highly dysfunctional home. I would also recommend you use your counseling services at the university.

I’ve been having a pretty hard time in life for the past year or two. I don’t know how to start this at all but basically I constantly contradict myself or cannot make up my mind. Like for a few days I’ll be happy and wanting to be with people. I’ll be caring and do nice little things like pay for a friend. I’ll be very hyper, productive and sexually aroused over the littlest things. Then within a few days I’ll get really quiet and isolate myself. To point where I cut, and seriously plan and consider my suicide. Theres alot of times where I just cry for no reason or I’ll feel like I’m pointless and worth nothing.<|im_end|>

 Hello and thank you for your question:A couple of questions come to mind first. Have you spoken with your doctor about these concerns? Your pediatrician could help you figure out if there is something physical going on that he or she could help you with.For instance, you may need some blood work to see how your thyroid is functioning. Or, you may be describing hormonal swings, that is, perimenstrual syndrome, which can be pretty dramatic and very upsetting. We call it perimenstrual because it can happen at any time during your monthly cycle, not just the week before or after.Another question I would have to ask is, are you doing a lot of caffeine? Do you drink a lot of soda or coffee, for instance, that can disrupt your sleep and mood? Are you taking any illegal substances?  Mood lifters can also lead to terrible crashes.The computer screen can mess up your sleep pattern as well. The bright light sends a message to your brain that tells you that it is still daylight (it may be 2 in the morning) and therefore it can’t shut down like it’s supposed to at night. We have a built in “sleep/awake” cycle that is set on a 24-hour clock and computers can interfere with that. So can the games we might be playing on computers, especially if they stimulate adrenaline, the big energy hormone.If you have had a physical and your doctor has ruled out issues that could be causing your mood swings, you may then want to talk with a therapist or even a psychiatrist to determine if there is something else going on that he can help you with.Mood swings with terrible lows and frantic highs are pretty common in teenagers, but I am concerned about your racing mind and your suicidal thoughts.  Please get a checkup, be honest with your doctor and if he can’t help you, please ask your parent to take you to a professional. You may even ask your pediatrician to recommend one.Please don’t take this suggestion as thinking that you’re “crazy” or anything like that. Quite the opposite. I think you are making a very healthy decision by asking for help here.  I do want to encourage you to get the care that you deserve so that you don’t need to suffer like this any longer.I hope this helps,<|im_end|>"

The two most likely reasons are a projection or a displacement. It is hard to know for sure because there are a lot of variables that could influence this, but a projection is when some internal process — often a negative one but it doesn’t have to be — is projected on to someone or something outside of us and we respond to them in a way that reflects the emotion inside.In displacement, the negative emotion gets put out onto something or someone that isn’t the cause of the emotion but instead become a target. A parent who has a difficult day at work who comes home and yells at their child is an example of this.These are just guesses and are not definitive at all as there are many variables that can influence these types of behaviors. If it persists you’ll want to have a chat with a therapist who can help you sort it through. The find help tab at the top of the page will locate someone in your area.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

After i broke up with a girl i was anxious and depressed and still in love. I was part of a healing group and had one to one healing where i told him everything about my love, fears, hopes. it was helping so i invited the girl along so he could help her. He started to divulge things to her i had said in confidence and pay her lots of attention. i had to stop going for a while but then asked him if he was seeing her. he said he was human but also he wouldnt do that. i couldnt ask her because she was always asking me to let go. five agonising months later, not knowing fully, she told me she was pursued by him and she eventually gave in. She got dumped after a week and he started seeing someone else from the group and i believe they are still together and happy, which is great. My ex was vulnerable, afterall it was a healing group. Apparantely, everything i told him about her on our healing sessions made him want her for himself. he took her away on a shaman retreat and one thing led to another. when he stopped it after the weekend he said she had too many issues for him. she never wanted him, she just went along with it but now knows she was duped and i feel so angry and hateful. Had they gone on and had a relationship i would stand back and be happy but we both feel so much worse and the lessons are vague. i told him my worst fear and he made it come true. he said he just reflected my fear in his action which is just the sort of garbage i would expect from him now i know his ego and intentions took over. if i thought he was a predator i would write something on his healing forum but i would have to back up my story which means going public with our names. he offends my sense of decency and has caused me so much emotional distress. i know i have to forgive him for my sake but there is acceptance and there is acquiescence, which means i will accept it but need to protest. do i let it go or dig it all up?<|im_end|>

 You have no problem recognizing the guilt of your meditation teacher/healer. In essence, you are saying that he knew that you would be sensitive to his dating your ex. That’s true, but surely you must recognize that no one in this world knew more or better that you would be hurt by your ex dating your teacher than your ex. Yet, she dated him anyway. Who should you be more upset with?It may well be, that you are still romantically interested in your ex girlfriend and as such you are hesitant to blame her for her wrongdoings. You are hurt because she chose to date your teacher. It is simply easier to say to yourself and to believe, “It’s not her fault.”Some would say that it is no one’s fault. She is your ex and from your description has made it clear that she wants you to let go and, as your ex, she is free to date absolutely anyone of any gender in the entirety of the world. Perhaps, she deliberately chose to date your teacher to clearly show you that she is no longer interested in you.When someone breaks up with you, they are sending you the following message. “There are millions of people in this world that are possibilities, but of those many millions you are not one of them. I know you and I don’t want you. There are millions of people that are possibilities for me, but not you. You are out. You are off the list. There are millions of people in this world that are possibilities. There are millions of people who I might date. There are millions of people who are still on the possibility list, but you and a handful of others are permanently banished from that list. You have made it to a new list, those that I do not want.”It is painful when you lose someone whom you love. It doesn’t matter how the loss has occurred. Breakup or death, both are painful ends. The pain that you will feel, will certainly last for years. The good news is that slightly each day the pain lessens. The process is so slow that you don’t notice it day-by-day, or even week-to-week but you will certainly notice it year-by-year. If you date enough people sooner or later you will experience the pain of losing someone whom you love. If you live long enough, you will experience the pain of losing two grandmothers, two grandfathers, one mother and one father. Don’t feel bad for yourself because that’s true for every living person and every person who has ever lived.Pain is a part of life, then again so is happiness and joy. If you are experiencing pain from a bad breakup, then counseling is a very good idea. You may need someone to guide you through this process but that someone is not a meditation — healer. It is a qualified professional. I can guarantee you one thing, no qualified professional will sleep with your ex girlfriend.Parting words: end your relationship with your ex. End it — cold turkey. No friends. When the day comes that you no longer care about her, that’s the day when you can once again become “friends.” I’ve experienced your pain and I have gone on to both survive and flourish. Expect the pain. Expect it to lessen and then one day it will be completely gone. The best cure and quickest? Find somebody else to love. You may not be ready to hear this, but do you really believe that she was the nicest, the kindest, the most attractive, the best suited for you? I hope not. The world is filled with possibilities for you and some much better than her.There are women reading this right now, who would never, under any circumstances, hurt you by dating your teacher or friend. They are just better than that. Also forget the idea that it wasn’t her fault “because she was vulnerable.” You either are competent or incompetent. If you are declared incompetent then you cannot make decisions and the power of attorney will be given to someone else. You are not competent to make decisions about what to buy, where to work and who to sleep with. But if you are not incompetent then it is implicitly understood that you are responsible for your actions. She is responsible for having slept with her ex-boyfriend’s teacher.I hope you can find the wisdom in my words. I know it’s not easy when you’re in pain. I hope that someday you’ll come to believe that I was right. Good luck, now and in the future.<|im_end|>"

 I’m so, so sorry you find yourself in the middle like this. It sounds to me like your mother is in some kind of emotional trouble. It’s not just that she’s having an affair. She’s stopped caring for children who are too young to be without a mother. You say this isn’t like her.I think you need to tell your mother what you’ve seen. As hard as it will be, don’t accuse her or blame her. That will just make her defensive and angry. Instead, tell her how worried you are about her and how scared you are for the family. If she gets angry, tell her that you’re the one who has the right to be angry but you’re just mostly scared; that you need your mother; that you and the other kids need their family. I understand that this is a lot to ask of you. But you’re asking even more of yourself if you decide you and your sister should keep such a difficult secret.You love your dad as well as your mom.Ask your mom to get you and your sister out of the middle. Suggest she get a counselor to help her sort out what to do. Tell her she needs to be the one to talk to your dad. It’s not fair to leave you feeling like you are betraying him by keeping quiet.If all this gets to be too much, seek out a counselor at school or talk to your minister or rabbi if you have one. Professionals like these honor confidentiality. They can give you important support during this difficult time.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

For about two years now, my brother had been dating this girl, and she has broken up with him six times. He keeps going back to her he just about got in a wreck a month ago over it. He has been fighting with my dad about every little thing. Then talks to her after every fight.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
It can be devastating to watch a sibling immersed in a destructive relationship. The hard part is that if you try to fix it, you’ll become part of the problem.Your brother’s need for chaos doesn’t have to become yours. Let him know you care about him and can see he is struggling, and ask if there is anything you can do to help. You let him know you care about him and want to help the essential message.Often this type of constant fighting and anger management issue is fueled by alcohol and or drug abuse. If that’s the case, your brother might profit from going to an open Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) meeting that you could offer to go with him. Not all relationship and family constant fights involve alcohol, but the percentage is high enough that it is worth mentioning.Detaching with love and compassion is the direction you need to move in. Let him know you care and have love for him help in whatever way you can, but he isn’t yours to fix. Self-care on your part is primary. Your brother will have to figure out the kind of life he wants to live by doing his own work.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

My best friend of 2 years is going through a lot. He’s trans and his mom is really overprotective, but I’ve been trying to be really supportive. Until today, when he told me he’s “otherkin” with Jack Frost. He honestly believes that he is the reincarnation of Jack Frost from an alternate universe. Honestly, I thought he was smarter than this; we used to laugh about how silly these theories were. I can’t take him seriously anymore. I know he’s been going through a rough time, plus he has pretty bad anxiety, but I feel like I just lost my best friend and I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know whether this is because of his dysphoria or if he’s having delusions from his anxiety, but whatever it is, it’s freaking me out. He’s been talking to these guys online who also believe they are “otherkin” and I think they are just taking advantage of his fragile mind, but I don’t know how to help him. If I tell him to stop talking to them, he’ll hate me. I can’t talk to his mom because he already doesn’t trust her. He’s going to therapy but I seriously doubt he’ll talk about this even if I ask him to. I’m at a total loss here, and frankly it feels like a bad dream I can’t wake up from. I just want my friend back!<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Either your friend is the reincarnation of Jack Frost or he is not. Either he is an otherkin or he is not. Believing in things that are not real can and do harm us. We are not entitled to our own personal, subjective reality. If in our own personal, subjective, reality we deeply and sincerely believe that the 9mm handgun is unloaded and we point that gun to our head and pull the trigger, we will only survive if in objective reality the gun is indeed empty.If in our own personal, subjective reality we believe that a new stock, recommended to us by our broker, will make us rich and can’t fail and we then mortgage our house to invest in the stock, we will be homeless unless in objective reality the stock was a good investment.Family members know, all too well, how difficult it is, if not impossible, to get a family member, who is clearly delusional, into therapy. Husbands can’t force wives, or wives force husbands, or brothers force sisters, into therapy. The general public is not aware of the severity of this problem but families with mentally ill members, are very much aware of the problem. Parents cry themselves to sleep at night, thinking of their mentally ill son or daughter who is sleeping on the street in the cold or rain. When someone finds out about their problem, their very first thought is “why didn’t they call someone?” And the answer to that question is, they did call someone in fact they called everyone. You simply cannot force someone to receive therapy if they choose not to and very often they choose not to because of their mental illness. They simply do not believe that there is anything at all wrong with them, so why would they choose treatment for a condition that does not exist?You can talk to your friend and you can be supportive and you can be there for them when they fail. Beyond that, there is very little that you can do. You can alert their parents, their brothers, sisters or other friends. You may lose your friend by simply attempting to save them but if you truly care about them, it is an acceptable loss. Good luck and thanks for caring.<|im_end|>"

I do not have any children of my own and have been married twice before – widowded and divorced from earlier marriages. My now husband has a lot of financial problems – he is a business man and has lots of debt. I married in haste, almost impulsively and he had not told me all the facts before marraige. He had told me that he was financially poor but had not offered any specifics of debt or law suits that he has been fighting. He clearly had expectations from me to help him which i got to know after marriage. During the first few months, he behaved badly – with agression and tried to coerce me into helping him financially. Fed up with the greed and demands i stood up and said that i cannot meet all his demands and that i will walk out if it continues. He has stopped that kind of behaviour now. Howver, I have lost trust in the man and i dont think that this relationship has my best interest in mind. I think of running away everyday. I am worried what will happen if he goes bankrupt or losses the law suits. I make a decent living, but i cannot support three people. I feel depressed worrying about the future. please help me with your insights. Specifically looking for help on how to cope and what decision to take.

 I wonder as well. I think you are asking the right questions. Clearly you are a successful woman in your professional life but haven’t found a way to use those same skills and sensitivities in your personal life. I think you need two kinds of help: a therapist and a lawyer. The therapist can help you understand what led you to make such an impulsive decision and how to take better care of yourself in relationships. The lawyer can help you understand how to protect your assets and what your legal obligations are to your husband. Once you have better information, you will be in a position to make new decisions.Please don’t repeat the mistake of making a hasty and impulsive decision. You owe it to yourself to take the time to do what is going to be right for you over the long term.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

A; The first thing to do is to see a medical doctor for a complete medical workup. Sometimes delusions like these are caused by things like a vitamin deficiency, an electrolyte imbalance or a brain tumor, to name only a few possibilities. I’d hate to have you go on heavy-duty psych meds if the problem is physical.If you are medically okay, then you need to take your letter and this response with you when you see your psychiatrist. A psychiatrist relies on you to provide enough information to determine an accurate diagnosis and to work out a treatment plan. Unless you are completely honest about what you are experiencing, your psychiatrist is left to guess – not a good basis for prescribing medicine.If you do have a mental illness, I strongly suggest that you get started with some psychotherapy as well as medication. You need more relief than meds alone will give you. A therapist can provide you with important support and can help you learn additional ways to cope.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My dad has been diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome, but I never really thought much of it. I’ve never had many friends.

More and more I’ve noticed people getting frustrated because I don’t understand what they mean, or I ask them to explain. They ask me how could they possibly get more specific. I’ve been very bothered with it, and I’ve found that I have become very depressed. I’m not really sure how to get help, or if I even need it.

Unfortunately, this is a question that is difficult to answer over the internet. I don’t have enough information about the situations you have described to determine if you are correctly interpreting them.It’s worrisome that you have become depressed. This is a sign that intervention is necessary. I would encourage you to ask your parents to take you to a therapist. The therapist can analyze these situations and determine if you are interpreting them correctly. They can also properly address your depression.If you don’t feel comfortable speaking to your parents, then tell the school guidance counselor or even a trusted family member about these issues. The goal is to find a way to get help for your depression.It’s very common for depression to be the result of faulty thinking. It’s possible that you are misinterpreting these events and drawing faulty conclusions which may be causing your depression. A therapist will be able to identify the problem, and most importantly, design a treatment plan to correct it. Thank you for your question. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 I’m so very sorry that the joy has gone out of living for you. I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of only a letter, of course. But it’s a strong possibility that you are suffering from a major depression.Most universities (including yours) have counseling services. Please take advantage of help that is so readily available. Make an appointment to have an initial meeting with a counselor. If you are too embarrassed to tell your story, bring your letter. You did an excellent job describing what life has been like for you. With the support of a therapist and perhaps some medicine, you could be feeling at least a little better in a month or two. I’m glad that it’s summer and that you have a break from classes.

I am a co-facilitator (pro bono, unlicensed) for a men’s DV group (court-mandated) at a non-profit. The leader is a therapist who also has a private practice. In group one of the men mentioned fear of losing his probation for something he didn’t do and being imprisoned for years at an upcoming hearing. He didn’t return to the group after the hearing. She discovered he indeed had been jailed with another hearing soon to determine whether he will be imprisoned. He’s made enormous progress, despite a terrible childhood and adverse family dynamics, he has a good heart and reaches out to other group members, attends a drug-tested substance abusers group three times a week, and has focused on becoming a father again to his children (they were not the recipients of his abuse). But he’s also expressed suicidal thoughts in the past in the context of never wanting to go back to prison, and he’s become worn out and depressed in dealing with The System (frequent court hearings, probation officers, in-laws, etc. – you can imagine), and we’re deeply concerned about his mental health. He’s received no visitors. LA County is under a DOJ consent agreement to improve its mental health resources, but there have been numerous suicides nonetheless. The therapist is considering visiting the client in jail to check on his health and give him moral support, to let him know someone cares. But she and the non-profit center are conflicted about ethics and boundaries and dual relationships – she says this issue was never discussed in school or workshops, and the non-profit doesn’t even have a policy because this issue has never arisen before. I think it’s because the people setting boundaries aren’t the kind of people who go to jail very often. A large proportion of the country’s 2 million prisoners have some degree of mental illness and get almost no care. He hasn’t called — he’s expressed a sense of unworthiness that might keep him from calling. I don’t think this is the usual ethics and boundaries issue, and I think in these circumstances the benefit for man’s mental health and maybe even his life far outweighs the boundary risk. What do you think? It seems a Catch-22, but shouldn’t be, given the problem of mental illness in prisons.<|im_end|>

 Thank you for your thought-provoking question. First, let me say how admirable it is to hear of your thoughtfulness for this man. I deeply admire your genuine concern for his well-being. The gray and beige area of this type of concern could be argued for both sides. I don’t think it is an easy answer — but if I were consulting I’d ask the administrators in the agency if it would be reasonable for you, the therapist, or you and the therapist together to write a letter letting him know you are there for him if he wants to reach out. He may have shame about his situation and not want visits, but a letter giving him permission to make a connection may be helpful. Reaching out in this way may be an acceptable way to show your concern.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

My boyfriend of two years broke up with me. It has been almost three months and I can’t stop thinking about him. He is 29, I am 24. Some days are better than others, but I still feel extremely sad and crappy about the whole thing. He told me when we broke up that when he thinks about his future, he doesn’t see me in it anymore, and as much as he wanted us to work he just can’t do it anymore. This crushed me, even though I knew a long time ago that he wasn’t right for me. But he was my first real love, and that was the last thing I thought I would ever hear him say. He started seeing someone the week after we broke up. They are still together. I know this because I still talk to and hang out with his friends (well his guy friend’s wives.) He doesn’t have facebook, but I looked his new girl up, and her profile is not private. She posts pictures of them, and status’ about them. It makes me sick, but I can’t stop looking at it. It literally gives me an upset stomach every single time. I even check his e-mail a few times a week. I try to talk myself out of looking but I can’t. I don’t know what to do anymore. I have not talked to him in almost two months, but I want to, badly. I want to know when he met this girl, if we were together when they met, if he cheated on me, etc. But I can’t do this or find this out without looking like the “crazy ex-girlfriend.” I feel so hopeless. Even though I say I don’t want to be with him, I also don’t feel like my heart is every going to be able to trust or fully love another person again. I don’t want him to be in my head anymore. It’s even affecting my sleep. I wake up from dreams about him, and then cannot go back to sleep. I try so hard to keep myself busy with family and friends, and even knew hobbies, but he is ALWAYS occupying my head. I don’t know what to do about it anymore, its driving me nuts. Please help. Any advice is appreciated. If you need more details I have an endless amount.<|im_end|>

 I am sorry about your loss. It can be difficult to lose someone with whom you feel so connected. The most helpful advice that I can offer is to focus on reality. The reality is that your boyfriend has ended the relationship. Unfortunately, you don’t have a say in the matter. When it comes to relationships, both individuals have to agree to be in the relationship. If one person votes no, and the other yes, the relationship ends. You must have two yes votes for the relationship to continue.Most relationships don’t last. It is the norm. Breaking up is essentially a universal experience. Virtually everyone can relate. Breakups can be difficult but there is often a “silver lining.” It frees you to search for someone who will love you as much as you love them.This is your first real love. The breakup was difficult. You are upset but in time your strong emotions about your ex will subside.Dating is a process of trial and error and as I’ve already mentioned almost all of them end up as an error. It is a process of rejection. It is a process of saying (by one of the parties) “Nope, not compatible enough.”Your ex appears to be saying just that. You and he were not compatible enough.Think about all of the millions of people who experience breakups. They, too, believed that they would never recover, or that they would never find another relationship but they did. You can too.I want you to look around at everyone you know who has a good relationship, even a seemingly perfect one. Then I want you to realize the long process of breakups, rejections, etc. that finally led to that really good relationship, that special person.Finally, I would advise that you stop viewing Facebook photos of your ex and his new girlfriend. Not only does it upset you, it is a waste of your time. Why bother with someone who does not want to be with you?The more assistance and support that you have during this difficult time, the better. It will pass and you will feel better. Please take care. <|im_end|>"

Now I’m starting to think I’m just crazy: I’m 20 years old and I find myself losing touch with the world more and more each day. All throughout my life I’ve always known I was different. Growing up, I understood things the other kids didn’t. I was smarter than the other kids and I was invincible. Things started going down hill for me around aged 12. I was still the smarted and different from everyone else, but I had lost friends. From this age onward I would only have 1 or less friends at a time. I started having troubling thoughts and began doubting my reality.<|im_end|>

 Your symptoms are unusual and concerning. You have feelings of grandiosity (i.e., feeling special). You also hear voices, experience paranoia, have trouble with social relationships, and have bouts of depression. With the exception of depression, your symptoms are characteristic of psychosis. Symptoms of psychosis are associated with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and several other mental health disorders. Individuals who experience a milder version of psychotic symptoms might have schizotypal, paranoid or schizoid personality disorder. I cannot say with certainly if you have any of the aforementioned mental health disorders. Only an in-person psychiatric evaluation could make that determination.To answer your question directly, yes, there is medication that could effectively treat your symptoms. Antipsychotic medications can decrease or eliminate the voices, paranoia and your grandiose feelings. Antidepressants can help to stabilize your mood. You may also want to consider therapy to address your social interaction difficulties.You have been experiencing psychosis-like symptoms since adolescence. These symptoms should be addressed and treated as soon as possible. Undoubtedly, they are negatively impacting your life. If left untreated, they may become worse and potentially lead to a full-blown psychotic episode. Medication would greatly reduce that risk and it could significantly improve the quality of your life. I hope that you will consider having a psychiatric evaluation and beginning treatment. I wish you the best of luck. Don’t hesitate to write again if you have additional questions. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 What happens to us in life, is almost always a combination of luck and decision-making. We can’t do anything about luck but we can do something about decision-making.Perhaps leaving a dull marriage was a mistake. Maybe marriage counseling could have repaired the relationship. Perhaps not. Certainly, choosing a woman who is a sociopath is a mistake. Returning to this woman after she lied and caused you to become incarcerated, was a mistake. Perhaps there are more but at least these decisions, were mistakes. Everyone can learn to make better decisions and thus reduce or eliminate the penalties that we must pay for having made poor decisions.Your anger at the people around you will do you absolutely no good. The fact that you have no intentions of killing them is good, but the fact that you feel this intense emotion towards them is of absolutely no value to you. In all likelihood, your anger towards these people is not only misplaced but is harmful to you. Your energies should be aimed completely at improving your life situation.Take advantage of any and all counseling that is available to you. Your counselor can help you to direct your emotions, your energies, towards things that will benefit you and will become a tangible good in your life. I hope that you will someday have the life that you desire.<|im_end|>"

I’m 21 and me and my girlfriend have been dating for a couple of years. Recently my girlfriend stayed over at my house for a few days. This is not the first time she has stayed over or met my parents, but after she left my mom started asking for my plans of our relationship. I sensed something was wrong and eventually found out that my mom does not like my girlfriend. When I asked her what specifically she does not like about her, she said that there wasn’t anything particularly wrong about her or anything in particular that she did wrong, but “sometimes people just aren’t likable.” Something to mention is that my parents are first generation immigrants and have a little bit of a language barrier when talking to my girlfriend. They can communicate and understand each other just fine, but there is a definite cultural barrier that makes them feel distant. My girlfriend expressed to me that she finds my parents super shy and thinks they’re watching and judging her all the time. Still, I don’t think this is a reason not to like anybody. After a long winded discussion, I found out that my mom feels the way she does more specifically because my girlfriend isn’t bubbly and cheery (the type of girl that smiles at everyone and radiates warmth and stuff) and I guess that’s who she imagines the ideal girl for me is. I completely don’t care about any of that and I love my girlfriend for who she is. I also pointed out to her that my girlfriend is intimidated by them because of the language barrier and its hard to be really bubbly when you are intimidated and feel distant. She then said she was shy and not confident. Then I got kind of mad that she was being like that, so after a bit of arguing she said “I don’t know how to explain, I haven’t liked her from the first time I laid eyes on her” and also “It’s okay because I don’t see you two being together in the long term anyways”. This infuriated me because she has zero reason to say that and then I blamed her for being jealous and didn’t even give my gf a chance. Now I have no idea what to do, and I’m wondering if you could help. It’s not like I have thought about marriage or anything like that, I understand that I’m only 21. I don’t really know how to dissect all of this. Help.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 You don’t need to mother’s blessing to go forward, but it would help to explain that it is her issue and that there isn’t much you can do to help her with it. It sounds like your parents have your best interest at heart, but don’t really understand that it pushes you further away rather than help you.Explain to parents that you are an adult and you need them to appreciate that. Let them know thatapproval of your girlfriend is not a requirement for you dating. Don’t try to fix this. Don’t try to be the go-between between the mother and your girlfriend. Focus on your relationship with your girlfriend and keep putting the responsibility for your mom’s feelings back on her. Don’t live your life trying to please your mother.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I am 23 year old and I was sexually abused by my brother when I was 6 years old. I only have fragments of memories of being abused as a kid. My brother pretended it never happened and never touched me again. I grew up being in confused state whether or not I was abused. From childhood, I lacked self control for example I was eating continuously, watching T.V. continuously for 8 to 10 hours, neglecting my health. I was messed up and never told anyone about this. Right now I have cut off all my contact with my brother and my condition is getting worse after I realized and accepted I was sexually abused. My daily activities has been severely hampered and I can’t seem to take control of my life, I feel like I am possessed and control by someone else when I am staying alone. I procrastinate a lot and knowingly hurt myself which i don’t like. I tried therapy and it didn’t work out my condition. I don’t know what to do as I feel lost. (age 23, from India)<|im_end|>

 I’m sorry that you are suffering in this way and I’d like to offer you hope. Accepting what happened to you is the first step and it takes a lot of courage. You have already done that so you are well on your way to healing, however, healing from something like this may be more than you can do alone. I know that you have tried therapy and feel that it didn’t help, but I would ask that you try again. Sometimes it is about timing, sometimes it is about finding the right match with a therapist, but therapy can be very helpful in learning how to heal and move on from the past.I would also suggest that you do some reading on the effects of sexual abuse and consider joining support group. Speaking with others who have gone through similar things can also be very helpful. Please don’t take your pain out on yourself, you have been hurt enough. Commit to finding healthy coping skills so that you can take control of your life again. It will get better.All the best,<|im_end|>"

From S. Africa: I have been in a serious relationship with this guy for 2 years now. He is 28 and I am 29. He is Spanish and I am Zimbabwean. We met while working in South Africa where we both currently reside. As far as our relationship goes, we get along quite well but he has such an unhealthy relationship with his mother. The more I get to know him the more I see it and it scares me.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 No, you’re not being paranoid. The most important relationship to your boyfriend and his mother is with each other. Boundaries have become blurred to an unhealthy extent. She should not be complaining to her children about her spouse. Your boyfriend should not be asked to take sides. He has two parents who will continue to be his parents regardless of whether they stay married. He deserves to have a relationship with his dad.Further, it is disrespectful of you when your boyfriend texts and Skypes his mother when he is with you. He has plenty of time to connect with her if he must before you get home.He may be wonderful in lots of ways, but bear in mind that what you see is what you get. If you marry him, you are also marrying his mom. If he has to chose between spending time with you and talking to his mother, he will put his mother first.I think you should take a huge step back and ask yourself if the other wonderful things about him are worth being his cook and housekeeper and tolerating this unusual enmeshed relationship he has with his mother. At the same time, your boyfriend should think about whether losing you is worth staying so intimately connected to mom. I can’t answer that question for either of you.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

From Syria: I’m 28 years old female, and I have intense fantasies about being physically tortured (caned, flogged, and burnt), I’ve had these fantasies since the age of 16, I also have an experience with self inflected pain (palm caning and burning to be more specific) or maybe it was my way to fulfill these fantasies, anyway I don’t do that very frequently because it leaves really bad bruises and scars that are hard to cover. basically physical pain is the only thing that makes feel excited. So I have two questions to ask A- Would you diagnose that as masochism or self injury disorder? B- Should I seek professional help? Thanks for your time<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Yours is a complicated question. You live in a part of the world where thousands of people are experiencing both physical and emotional pain. If you are feeling guilty that you have been exempted from those experiences, it is possible that you are (unconsciously) joining with your community by giving yourself pain. That may be a stretch on my part. It just occurred to me as a possibility as I was reading your letter.But you also said that pain is the only thing that makes you excited. I have to wonder how it is that you have separated so much from your feelings.Regardless of the reason, I do think professional help would be useful.I can’t make a diagnosis on the basis of a letter. But a counselor can help you make sense of your feelings, put a stop to the self-harm and find healthy ways to find excitement. If you have the option to see a counselor, I very much hope you will do so while you are still young and more flexible. Continuing the self-harm will only reinforce it as a way to put some “excitement” into your life.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I think there’s something wrong with me. I’ve been interested in psychology for a while now and I’ve seen a lot of symptoms of depression and schizoid personality disorder that apply to me. It’s summer right now and I’ve noticed that it’s gotten worse. I’ve been thinking less about killing myself and have stopped cutting for a while, but I’ve been more detached. Like really detached. I don’t even want to leave my room anymore. I feel overwhelmed when I have to interact with people. I feel like when anyone enters my room, that they’re invading my personal space and I really just want them to go away. I want to be alone all the time and I’m really worried that it might affect my school life, since my course in college requires me to be really social. I also think that I was molested when I was a kid. I’ve had “flashbacks” or whatever, but I’ve never told anyone about it. I also have a fascination with sex. Is there really something wrong with me? If I told other people about this, they wouldn’t believe me or they’d make fun of me. I just need to know if I’m just delusional or if I actually need help.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I can’t tell if you’re delusional on the basis of a letter. I can tell you what you are already telling yourself: Something is wrong. You know it. You’ve known it for awhile. If you could take care of it on your own, you would have done so already. You do need help.It’s possible that you’re right. If you tell friends or family, they may not know how to help you. When people feel helpless or afraid, they sometimes minimize problems or are dismissive of them. Better to start with a professional. Therapists are not judgmental and are trained to help you make sense out of even contradictory information. I assure you, a therapist or counselor will not make fun of your pain.It sounds to me like you are in a good state of mind to begin to work on yourself. You’ve stopped cutting and you are less depressed. You had the strength to make an impostant first step by writing to us. Now, please take the next step. Most schools have a counselor or mental health service for their students. I suggest that you make an appointment for an evaluation and take your letter and this response with you when you go. The letter will help you and the therapist get started.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

The problem in a nutshell is that I have no close friends and when I’m single (which is the case right now) I’m completely lonely and more depressed than ever. In social situations where I don’t know anybody I fit the definition of a wallflower to a T. I’ve been so desperate to make friends that I’ve pushed myself to go to parties or events but when I get there I’m so awkward and introverted that I’m nearly brought to tears and usually leave early. Once I even traveled 40 minutes to a social event I found online just to see all the people there and turn around without even going inside.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m so sorry that you’ve had this longstanding problem and haven’t found the help you need. Zoloft may help take the edge off but it isn’t going to help you find the friends you long for. At this point, you may be feeling so defeated in this area of life that you radiate pessimism even when you do approach people.I strongly suggest you get involved in some group therapy. In group, you will get feedback about what you do and don’t do that gets in your way. You will have the opportunity to interact with people in a safe place where everyone is working on their issues. With the guidance of the therapist, you will not only learn some new skills, but you will have the opportunity to rehearse them with group members before you take them out into the world. This will give you some new and much-needed self-confidence.Google search either “social therapy, NYC” or “Group therapy, NYC” and you will find quite a long list of resources.You made an important first step in writing. I hope you will take the next step and get some practical and emotional help. It’s completely understandable that you are discouraged. But you are only in your 20s. If you take care of this issue now, you will have many, many years of having more of what you want in life.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I can’t grasp how many women my boyfriend has been with. My boyfriend has been with more people than I can imagine. He feels rather ashamed of his sexual history. He has had sex with friends, married friends, one night stands, and made friends just to have sex with them. As far as he can “remember,” he did not use a condom with 3 of them (his total number of sexual partners is 15). Since then he has been checked for Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs).<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
First, it’s important to understand that your boyfriend’s past is his past and it should stay that way. Who he had sex with previously should have no bearing psychologically on your current relationship. If he had unprotected sex, then this should concern you only from the perspective of not wanting to contract a sexually transmitted disease, but this should be your only concern. There is nothing that he can do to change his past. The problem is not his, it’s yours.If his past bothers you, then it is important to examine why that may be. Part of it may be jealousy. Jealousy is related to a lack of self-esteem. If you felt fully confident about yourself, then you probably would not be thinking about his previous relationships and girlfriends. You may also think that because he has had many sexual experiences, he must be comparing you to those women.Please realize that your boyfriend cannot change his past, and it is not fair for you to be upset with him about actions that he took while you and he were not in a relationship. I also question whether it is fair to be concerned about his “friends” if he has not done anything untrustworthy to warrant your suspicion. With time and as you gain self-confidence, his sexual history will not – and nor should it – concern you. As you remain in a trusting, faithful relationship with him, your sense of self and his reassurance will help you reach a better place of acceptance regarding his past.In the meantime, it is important for you to recognize that these are your feelings and concerns. Your boyfriend cannot wave a magic wand and “wish away” his past behavior. If you want to continue the relationship, then you need to stop focusing on his past. Redirect your focus on the “here and now.” Judge him for the actions that he makes while he is currently in the relationship and do not punish him for his previous behavior which he cannot change. Try thinking of it this way. If it were you with his sexual past, would you want him to judge you as you are now or as you were then?<|im_end|>"

My issue is complicated. I was diagnosed with different several mental disorders between the ages of 17 and 22. By about the age of 21 I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder. This is the label I continue to carry; despite being in complete “remission” for several years and off all medications. I no longer have access to a psychiatrist (& could spend several months waiting to see one).<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I realize that you do not want to take medication. Many people feel the same way. They don’t like the side effects and medication alters their personality. However, you are experiencing serious symptoms that are disrupting your life. Hallucinations, if left untreated, generally become worse. The risk is that you will experience a full-blown psychotic episode. You don’t want to take that risk.Medication may be necessary but only temporarily. It seemed to have worked for you before, to the point where you no longer needed it. You may have to repeat that process.Another option to consider is taking a low dose of medication or a different combination of medications. All of these options should be discussed with a psychiatrist.You have to deal with the reality of your situation. Yes, medications can be unpleasant but they have a proven track record of treating your symptoms.You are also experiencing flashbacks. One particular treatment that many people have found to be effective for reducing flashbacks is eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). EMDR is a form of highly structured psychotherapy that is used to treat symptoms associated with past traumas. Hypnosis may be another option.If you choose to pursue either option, you may want to consult a specially trained trauma therapist. Perhaps your current therapist could assist you in deciding whether or not those treatments would be appropriate for you. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I am bipolar married but separated. I want to get my family back. My 5 year old stepson is in therapy as well as my wife and I. we all go to separate therapists.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 There are many legitimate ways to do clinical work. Some therapists think it’s important for the two people in the couple to be with individual therapists to work out their own issues first before going into couples and family work. Others, like myself, think it’s important for the couple to be in treatment with the same therapist, sometimes seeing the therapist together and sometimes separately. There’s no hard and fast rule. It’s a matter of the therapist’s training and experience.The reason I prefer to work in an ongoing way with all members of a family is that I want each member to bear witness to the other’s work. I think it’s important that the two adults know what’s going on for each other so they can support one another. Further, I don’t want to know things about an individual that his or her partner doesn’t know. Intimacy belongs with the couple, not with one person and me. Finally, a child needs to regain trust in his parents and have assurance that he will be heard and responded to. The therapy room can sometimes provide the safety for the relationship between a child and parent to be healed. But, as I said, other therapists see the situation differently.It sounds to me like the therapist who is seeing your wife is in a good position to see you and your wife together again. She is current with at least part of the story. If you feel that you are going to be ganged up on if you ask to go back, that’s the first thing you should deal with in session. Trust in your therapist is essential if any progress is going to be made.It sounds like you and your family have been through a very tough time. It may be that it’s important for your wife and son to pull back a little to recover. If you are going to reconstitute your family, it’s my opinion that at some point it will be important to get everyone back in the same room.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

Ever since I was little I’ve never fit in. I didn’t have any friends at school besides family members. I did have an invisible friend, but I hardly ever went out to recess. I always stayed inside and read books at the library. But it never bothered me that much. Also I had a problem that my sister(she doesn’t live with me) mentioned I had when I was little. I would always repeat what another person said to me, not to be snarky, but I just couldn’t help it. I researched this a little bit and I now know it to be echolalia. I also enjoyed picking at dead skin. I was moved up to magnet schools (for highly intelligent children…or that’s what they said), but I still didn’t fit in.<|im_end|>

 I am sorry that you are experiencing a difficult situation. You want help but you don’t know how you can get it. You asked your mother to take you to treatment and she refused. I can understand why you feel miserable.You described having difficulty with social interaction for most of your life. You also described some repetitive behavior, which you identified as echolalia. I wonder if you have ever been evaluated for a pervasive developmental disorder (PDD). One type of PDD that may match some of your experiences is Asperger’s disorder.Asperger’s disorder is considered a mild form of autism. The hallmark feature of the disorder is severe and sustained impairment in social interaction. Other diagnostic features of Asperger’s disorder include:Several aspects of your letter led me to believe that Asperger’s disorder may be a possibility including: repeating what others said (as a child), picking at dead skin (as a child; now hair pulling as an adult), difficulty with social interaction and above average intelligence. Again, please understand that I cannot diagnose you over the Internet. You may not have this or any disorder. The only way to know for certain what, if any, disorder you may have is to be evaluated by a trained mental health professional.Here is what I would suggest that you do. If your mother is not willing to take you to treatment then speak to someone at your school who may be able to help. This may include a school guidance counselor, a principal, a teacher or the school nurse. You can also ask a trusted family member for help.My two main concerns about your situation are that you have attempted suicide in the past and your mother is unwilling to help you seek treatment. If she is not willing to help you seek treatment, you should try to access it for yourself. This is not an ideal solution but it may be necessary. Your goal should be to find a mental health worker or therapist who can help and support you. I would strongly encourage you to reach out as soon as possible for help. Please do not give up until you find someone who will help you.Asking for help from a school counselor is free. Community mental health centers also offer free and low-cost services to individuals on a fixed income. There are inexpensive ways to access treatment.One phone number you should have in your possession is the national suicide hotline, 800-273-8255. If you’re feeling upset call this number and speak to a professional counselor.If you’re feeling suicidal go to the hospital immediately, no matter what your mother says. I understand that she is religious and believes in the power of God. Faith in God can greatly enhance one’s life and personal well-being but after all God created many therapists of various kinds. Mental health symptoms should be treated by mental health professionals.Please do not hesitate to ask for help. Thank you for your question. I wish you the best of luck.<|im_end|>"

Background: I have been diagnosed with Schizoaffective and Severe Bipolar Disorder w/ Psychotic Symptoms by 2 psychiatrists.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Hallucinations are associated with psychotic disorders, drug use and some organic brain syndromes. There are multiple theories that attempt to explain why they occur. The nature of hallucinations is complex and their cause is unknown.One intriguing theory about auditory hallucinations involves an inability for some people to recognize their own voice. We all hear an inner dialogue. This voice we typically recognize as our own. Several studies have indicated that some people with schizophrenia have difficulty recognizing their own voice. Some scientists theorize that it could be due to faulty neurological functioning. If you hear a voice that you don’t recognize as your own, your brain might naturally conclude that it was someone else’s voice.Maybe something similar happens with your thoughts. These thoughts are generated by you, but you’re not recognizing them as your own. You also might be describing thought insertion, which is a belief that an outside influence is inserting thoughts into your mind. It is a symptom of psychosis and commonly linked to schizophrenia.There may be other possibilities as well. I would recommend discussing your concerns with your psychiatrist. He or she might have more insight into why you are having these experiences and more importantly, how to reduce or prevent them from happening. A medication adjustment might be necessary.You might also try reading about the nature of auditory hallucinations. You can learn more about the aforementioned brain theory in the book Neurologic: The Brain’s Hidden Rationale Behind Our Irrational Behavior.

I have been to therapists. I have taken the medications prescribed. This is going on about 30 years, most of my adult life. It is sad to look back and realize that none of my dreams have come true and the future isn’t looking any better.<|im_end|>

 I thank you for your long letter. As in therapy, the more information that is revealed to the therapist, the more the therapist can help. Though I am not acting as the therapist on the Internet, the information that you have provided me will allow me to give a more informed response.When someone feels as if they are no longer in control of their life they often lose hope. Depression follows that loss of hope. You need to regain control of your life. It appears as if you have deferred living your life so that your family can fully live theirs. It is as if you have deferred your happiness for theirs.One might say, “it is good for a family member to sacrifice their happiness for the happiness of others, in the family.” And you might say that you have done just that. I would agree that it is good for a family member to sacrifice their happiness for other members of the family but that is only true when every other family member is willing to sacrifice their personal happiness.It appears that in your case, though you sacrifice for them they do not sacrifice for you. In essence what I’m saying is that your happiness is as valuable as theirs. Your daughters happiness is valuable but not more valuable than is yours. You need to properly value your own happiness. You cannot simply sacrifice your life for theirs without the resulting feelings of a loss of control and depression.Carl Jung believed that depression was actually a good thing because it forced you, the conscious mind, to reconnect with the directives of the unconscious mind. In other words, it was helping you to be more you, or in the language of Abraham Maslow, to become more self-actualized.I have had many clients with high government security clearances. I have known many therapists who have also treated persons with similarly high government clearances. As you know, many congressmen and senators have received counseling. Under the HIPPA laws, everything concerning your therapy would be completely secret. Many of our military leaders use psychoactive medications.Depression is a fairly common disorder among the population. Sometimes depression can be serious enough that it requires hospitalization, but that is not the usual treatment prescribed for most people who suffer from depression. Depression in most people is most commonly treated in an outpatient setting, usually with a 50-minute psychotherapy session per week, and psychiatric medications.Using the services of a therapist is no different than using the services of a dentist. You have heard of family counseling, couples counseling, etc. None of the individuals involved in that counseling would receive a diagnostic code for a mental illness. Think of counseling as an analysis of your life and the mistakes that you are making and the support that is necessary while you correct those mistakes.Family members sacrifice for each other. It appears as if you are sacrificing more for your family than they are sacrificing for you. My guess would be that this is your nature. That you have always given more to others than they have given to you. For your life to be better and it should be better, your family must sacrifice some of their happiness so that you can receive more of the happiness that you need and deserve.It could be that it was you who established the family dynamic. Perhaps your wife would have given more to you if she knew that it was necessary for your happiness. Perhaps your children were raised to be more self-centered because that was the way that you mistakenly raised them.It is correctable. I have had much experience and success reestablishing proper family dynamics.I hope that you will consider what I’ve written and I wish you the very best with your future.<|im_end|>"

 I recently found out that my boyfriend may have schizophrenia. I realize I am not a doctor, and he has never been diagnosed that I am aware of, but based on what he has told me and some research I have done that is what I believe his illness to be. At first I just thought he had trust issues because he was cheated on years ago by the mother of his son…I also thought he was just uncomfortable in social situations. Our relationship has been a little rocky because he sometimes gets withdrawn. It is also a bit hard to read him because we live in different states, so I thought distance was a problem as well. We were recently going through one of a few “break-ups”…he starts to think he can’t trust me and that he hears mens voices in my apartment when we are on the phone. He has never been angry or violent, just hurt and confused. I dismissed the men’s voices because I had a really bad cell phone that had a lot of interference on the line and would always drop calls…I thought it was just a bad connection. I have been nothing but faithful to him. During this time when he said he was thinking about ending our relationship again, I felt helpless…I thought that if he didn’t trust me at this point, he may never trust me. I have done nothing but reassure him. I thought maybe ending the relationship was our only choice instead of going through this cycle over and over again. I figured one of two things would happen:1) it wasn’t meant to be (which I don’t believe at all) and I could start healing or 2) me ending the relationship would make him realize that he didn’t want to be without me (as he has said countless times) and maybe he would start to trust me. When we were on the phone about to discuss the possible ending of our relationship he started to tell me about his ex cheating on him. I just listened…this was the first time he had opened up about it. As I was listening he started to tell me that that is why he had issues with trusting me. He believes that people can hear his thoughts. He believes that someone put a device in him that allows this and that he is certain that I have known about it all along and I may even be an undercover agent. He said he doesn’t understand how I could love him because I can hear his thoughts and sometimes he has terrible thoughts about me (pertaining to the cheating) His exact words were “I don’t think I am crazy, but if I am then I am really crazy…but I don’t feel crazy” I realize the word “crazy” is not an acceptable term…I am just quoting him. So I don’t know if he realizes he is ill or not. I think there is a window of hope there based on that statement. Maybe he will be open to treatment. This all came as a complete shock to me. I didn’t react very well…actually I didn’t really react at all. We still discussed our break up…I could not process anything really…and all I could say is that I love him. For the first time he didn’t say it back. I told him that hurt me, and he said what’s the point now, people who love each other don’t break up. I could tell he was very hurt. We haven’t had a whole lot of contact in the past few days. I don’t even know it he wants me in his life anymore. I sent him an email telling him I love him and I am here for him when he is ready to talk. He sent me back an email saying that he had gotten my email and we will sort this through in time. I am hopeful because he hasn’t shut me out completely. I love him very much and we have talked about spending our lives together…marriage…children…the whole deal. I don’t know what my next step should be…I do know that I love this man and I will not turn my back on him. I want to help him and be by his side 100%. I am worried he will not want to get help and I am not sure of how to approach it. He said this has been going on for many years…so he has managed to live with it for some time. He hasn’t worked in over a year, and he also has a son that lives with him. That is another reason I don’t believe he or anyone close to him really knows about his illness. I believe his son’s mother would not allow the son to live with him if she was aware. He did mention he told his mother…but I don’t know what came of that. If anyone has any support or suggestions for me, I would appreciate it. I have been trying to educate myself as much as possible. And any advice on how to talk to him about it would also help. I have a planned trip to see him next week…I still plan on going. I will only be there for two days, so time is an issue. Not that I have to figure everything out then…but I would like to make the most of the little time we have together. Thanks for reading!<|im_end|>

 The symptoms that you have described may be a sign of schizophrenia or a related psychotic disorder. His symptoms may also indicate illicit drug or alcohol use. A third possibility is that his symptoms are indicative of an untreated medical condition. All three possibilities need to be considered and explored.You believe that he may be willing to go to treatment. That is very encouraging. Individuals who are willing to seek treatment have a more favorable prognosis than individuals who are unwilling to seek treatment.On your next visit, encourage him to seek help. If possible, offer to attend some appointments with him. The idea is to make him aware of the fact that you’re willing to support him in any way that he needs. He is more likely to seek help if he feels that he has your support.If he is resistant, remind him that he is loved. You and his son care and rely on him to be well. Inform him that ignoring the problem not only affects him but also you and his son. Reminding him that others rely and care about him may motivate him to receive treatment, even if he is reluctant to do so.Generally speaking, be loving and supportive but also adamant about the need for help. In the case of psychosis, the importance of early treatment cannot be overstated. The “find help” tab, at the top of this page, can help you to locate a mental health professional in the community. If you have additional questions, please do not hesitate to write again. Take care.<|im_end|>"

 Pete Earley, best-selling author of the book Crazy, A Father’s Search Through America’s Mental Health Madness, recently profiled the death of a much-loved mental health advocate named Glenn Koons. The story of Mr. Koons is a tragic one. He was a peer-to-peer advocate who worked with groups such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness. He was recently invited to the White House by President Barack Obama to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.Mr. Koons had gone missing and was recently found dead by a utility worker in a small Pennsylvania town. Some believe that he stopped taking his medication, had a relapse and may have been too ashamed and embarrassed to seek help because of his high-profile status as an individual who had recovered from a mental illness.The tragic story of Mr. Koons’s death underscores the importance of seeking help. It also highlights the reality that there is no shame in seeking help. No one is certain what happened to Mr. Koons but it is possible that his death could have been prevented. No one knows with certainty what Mr. Koons was thinking and the speculation could be completely inaccurate; however, for many people it is the fear of failure and embarrassment that stops them from getting life-saving help. This should not be the case.Would you feel embarrassed about seeking help for a broken leg or a bleeding ulcer? I highly doubt it. The same logic should apply when seeking help for a mental illness. There is a stubborn and inaccurate belief in our society that asking for help for a psychological problem equates to being weak or to not having the willpower to handle your own problems. Nothing could be further from the truth.Each of us faces a series of problems throughout our lives. The nature and severity of those problems varies to one degree or another but problems are a part of daily life. They are a part of human existence. Relapses do happen. You have nothing to be ashamed of. Feeling ashamed is tantamount to blaming yourself for hearing voices. The fact that you hear voices is not your fault. If your loved one were suffering in a similar manner, you would hope and expect that they would come to you for help. It sounds as though you have a supportive mother who loves you. You also have access to a therapist. Please utilize the resources that you have available to you.Treatments are available that can decrease or eliminate your unpleasant symptoms. Get help as soon as possible. It is the only correct way to handle this situation. I wish you the best luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

For the past 6 years my father-in-law has been suffering from some kind of mental illness. He is now 90 years old and physically reasonably healthy for his age. His problem is that he seems to completely believe that he can’t do anything and that he is on the way out. Anything that we do to help him he is convinced is killing him. He will do nothing for himself and needs to be strongly encouraged to the point of pushing to do anything. By anything I mean eating, drinking, getting up, washing, going to the toilet, standing-up Etc. He will physically try to resist, shouts at the top of his voice “I can’t, I can’t”, makes all sort of totally illogical excuses etc. He won’t feed himself but although he shouts and says it’s killing him, he will open his mouth and take the food. He cannot make any decisions, doesn’t want to engage in conversation or talk to people. However with patience and when he is not being pushed to do anything he will answer questions, he will get involved in doing the crossword and will show some interest in the newspaper and TV. At these times it is clear that he has no loss of memory (over any time period) and is fully aware of what is going on. He is as good as anyone at the crossword and will make sensible comments about sport, current affairs etc. Even though he won’t get up himself to go to the toilet, occasionally during the night he will. In the past he has been prescribed different anti-depressants but these just made him a zombie without any benefit. We have tried seeing a psychiatrist but he was not willing to open up and could thus not make any progress. We are pretty much resigned to the fact that he is not going to get any better however there is always the worry; is there anything else we could do. Despite much searching I can’t seem to find any similar cases or clear explanations. The local mental health teams and even a private psychiatrist have been very unhelpful either saying “classical depression” before prescribing drugs or saying that its “one of those things, at his age if it wasn’t this it would be something else” (and that was 6 years ago). Any explanation, suggestions would be most welcome.<|im_end|>

 You mentioned that when he is pushed he is resistant but “… with patience and when he is not being pushed…” he is easier going. Perhaps that is your answer. Being patient with him seems to work. The more patient you and your family are with him the easier it will be to care for him.I would encourage you to consult with specialists who treat elderly populations. This includes psychiatrists and other medical and mental health professionals. You can consult them on your own or with yourfather-in-law (if he’s willing).Because part of the problem is that your father-in-law behaves differently in front of certain people, you might consider videotaping his behavior. You should also keep a written record of the behavior that concerns you. Having this type of information could help the evaluators identify what may be wrong with him.If it continues to be difficult to care for him, you might need extra help. There are many services he may be eligible for, including home healthcare and other related nursing services. Check with the insurance company or his primary care doctor to determine if home healthcare could assist you and your family in caring for yourfather-in-law . I hope this helps. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My husband and i have been together for 4 years. i have a 19 yo daughter and he has a 19 yo son. the son was primarily living with his mother until he graduated from high school at such time, he moved in full time with us. ever since he has moved in there have been issues. he lies, he has stolen pills from my bathroom and he went through my purse and stole more pills from me. i wanted him out. my husband didn’t. i told him he needed to move back in with his mother to get help. finally, my husband went along with it. during the time he was gone, my husband resented me every second his son was not there. he was gone for a month and i suggested the son to come stay the night one night so that i could start to build back trust in him. my husband took that as he could move back in and he moved back in. a few months later, we catch him in more lies and now something has happened where i feel he has violated my daughter’s privacy by going into her room. not sure of his reason for entering her room (which he denies), but the only conclusion i can come to is that he was masturbating in there. i’m not sure but that is what my gut tells me. i don’t know what to do anymore. i don’t feel safe in my own home. my husband put a lock with key on my daughter’s door and i don’t think that is anyway anyone should have to live. i don’t want his son living with us anymore, however, i know my husband will not go for that and if he does agree to have him move out, he will resent me. if anyone could offer any advice, it would be greatly appreciated.<|im_end|>

 Thank you for writing us with this important question about blended families. Your husband’s denial of his son’s problem needs to be front and center in your relationship. It’s not okay for you, and you don’t have to live this way. It is clear that his son has problems that are going untreated and diminishing family life.It is important to know that you must continually standup speaking out that you do not want to live this way. I highly recommend couples counseling so a professional can help you both work toward a resolution. The counselor can help your husband understand that his effort to help his son is alienating his wife and stepdaughter. Getting a professional to help you through these issues is important.I would also recommend during this time that you find an individual therapist for yourself. It sounds like this has been going on for a while, and that your husband doesn’t understand how devastating this this is for you. You may need to have an individual therapist in your corner as you work through the details of coping during couples therapy.

From Australia: If possible, I would like some advice on what I can do to help my partner as he is depressed. A little more detail: My partner, “P” has depression. He has grown up with it on and off for most of his life. Recently though, he has had it for the last 3 months. (Although he has only just told me about it) . He over-thinks a lot of situations, this often makes him really stressed and prohibits him from study/assignments (which in turn makes him even more stressed out!) . Puts a lot of pressure on himself to succeed in his study. He is very passionate about what he is learning, although he is never satisfied with his creations/assignments. In turn, this puts more stress on himself. . He has told me that he often feels guilty or lazy when he is not studying/finds it hard to have fun or feel happy when he is not working on assignments. . It has got to the point where he doesn’t feel happy about anything he does, be it in his free time or study. He is having a really hard time getting motivated to do anything. . When he is with me all his stress and worries seem to ‘fade away’ as he has recently told me. He says that being with me is like being in “Lala land”, his worries are dulled when with me and he is able to be happy during the time we are together (It’s now at the point where he only feels happy when with me). He is self conscious about being clingy, and both he and I know that this behavior is not healthy. . He has kept the fact the he only feels happy when around me a secret until only this week…<|im_end|>

 I’m so glad you and your boyfriend both understand that it isn’t healthy for him to be happy only while with you. Whether he means to or not, he is making you responsible for his well-being. This is dangerous for both of you. You can certainly be sympathetic. You can certainly do your best to remind him what it’s like to have some fun. But you can’t fix the essential problem. For that, he needs to see a professional. There is something going on about school and studying that is overwhelming his abilities to cope. It may be rooted in past history with family or school or his expectations for himself. His self-esteem is too wrapped up in his academic achievement, and it is immobilizing him.Most colleges have some kind of mental health or counseling services. He could start there. If it would be helpful, you could go with him to his first session to give the counselor your perspective. But then he needs to follow through on his own. Medication might help lessen the depression, but it won’t eliminate the cause. To really get on top of his depression, he has to be willing to take himself seriously enough to do some serious talk therapy as well.Whether or not your relationship continues, he needs to do this for himself. Life, being alive, will present him with many challenges. Knowing how to cope and feel worthwhile even when things are hard is what helps people come through problems and disasters with their confidence — and their relationships — intact.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 The best place to begin is to make an appointment with your primary care physician (PCP). It is important to rule out a medical explanation, especially because you have a history of a brain tumor. As you mentioned, some of your symptoms may be attributable to the lingering effects of the brain tumor.When you visit the PCP, provide a detailed report of your medical and psychiatric history. Also report your current set of symptoms. The more detailed you are about that information, the easier it will be for the doctor to assist you. You were very detailed in your letter. It might help to bring the letter to the appointment. Prior to the appointment, prepare a list of your symptoms and the questions that you have. Having a list ensures that you won’t forget important details.Your PCP may suggest that you undergo a variety of medical tests. He or she may also refer you to a psychiatrist, a neurologist and a psychotherapist for additional tests or evaluations.You alluded to the fact that you are either currently using drugs or you have a history of using drugs. I am not sure if you were referring to prescription drugs or to illegal drugs. Illicit drug use can exacerbate and in some cases lead to the development of psychiatric symptoms. It is important that your doctor is aware of all past or present drug use. You may not want to reveal that type of information to your doctor but missing facts can result in an inaccurate diagnosis and subsequently, an inappropriate plan for treatment.It is important that you are evaluated as soon as possible. Start with your PCP. I hope this answer helps you to know how to proceed. Please take care.  <|im_end|>"

Hi I am 20 years old and just recently moved to Chile with my mother after the separation with my step dad. I have always suffered from depression and have taken medication for it but it seems to never work. These past few years it seems that I have gotten worse. I am constantly down on myself never thinking I am good enough. I can’t even remember what it feels like to be happy. I get angry over what my mother tells me are small things but I tell her they aren’t small to me. I am always on a rollercoaster of emotions, I can be having a good time and the simplest thing will bring me down and I am upset the rest of the day.<|im_end|>

 I am sorry this has become such a difficult time in your life. Depression is often activated when we feel we cannot control various aspects of our life, and gaining control of the areas we can is typically the key for feeling better.There are several things we can do to combat depression that I have identified elsewhere. I will encourage you to read through these as a foundation for change.In a nutshell, some strategies listed in this article include:“Positive psychology – strategies designed to shift your thoughts and feelings toward a more positive framework. This isn’t a simplistic “think-happy-thoughts” approach, but rather a focused effort at cognitive restructuring of your thought process. The strongest combination to approach depression is therapy combined with an antidepressant. If you do not want to take an antidepressant there are several homeopathic or herbal alternatives that may be helpful. You may want to consider group therapy as a means of supplementing your individual therapy. Group therapy is different in that there is an interactive feature that can’t be duplicated in individual therapy, and it often provides a vehicle for support as you begin to make changes in your life. Your therapist may know someone he or she can refer you to in your area. Meditation – learning how to self-soothe your emotional turmoil is perhaps the most important skill you can learn. Aerobic exercise – the value of exercise in combating depression is very well documented and this is particularly true for any exercise involving aerobic displacement. Review your diet – our emotional life often changes our craving for various foods, which may not have the best impact on our biochemistry.”The short answer is that coping with a depression is like walking up a down escalator and we must find the tools and the strength to deal with changing our thoughts and attitude as a way of neutralizing and overcoming these feelings. In particular I would encourage the use of the technique called the “Three Blessings” because it can be used as a direct way to start changing your thoughts.I would encourage you to seek counseling now to develop a support system in your new location. The find help tab may be helpful as international links are included.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

MY ex was horrible to me. We were together for 3 years and he’s kicked me out more times than I could count. Kicked me out on Christmas even at 2am (so technically it was Christmas). Conceived a child with his baby mama while we were together. His baby mama’s sister and her friends jumped me and he did little to help me. Then kicked me out 3 days later because I told my family about it. He didn’t want to tell his baby mama we were still together because he didn’t want anymore “drama.” And despite all of that when he quit his job because his baby mama had filed child support I allowed him and his uncle to move in with me and for 3 months I took care of him while he and his uncle sat in the house playing Xbox. After those 3 months he apparently found a job and didn’t tell me and moved out without me knowing (he actually called me and stalled me at the grocery store while he moved!!) So 2 weeks after that incident I rebounded with an ex boyfriend and got pregnant but because initially because the tech was a little off (which was corrected at my first prenatal app. I found out I was pregnant when I went to ER for a pain in stomach) I was honest with him and told him he may not be the father and he knew that more than likely he wasn’t. And he stayed with me my whole pregnancy and encouraged me to include the real father, so when my son was born I did just that, but he didn’t like that and 3 months ago he dumped me after I refused to help him on a down payment on a car (honestly I didn’t even cry when he dumped me I felt so relieved I didn’t even bother to call him or anything but he ended up calling me a week later. Usually we would get back together after a breakup but I didn’t even suggest it because I didn’t want it) and now he’s marrying his baby mama in September. He was horrible and I shouldn’t even have feelings of love for that man. How do I get over this? I don’t even want him back so I don’t understand why it upsets me so much.<|im_end|>

 I am glad you realize that your ex wasn’t good to you and that there is something not okay about wanting to stay in a relationship that was so abusive and damaging.The work here isn’t so much about getting over him, as to be getting into you. You need to reclaim your life and focus on self-care, intellectual and emotional growth. I recommend you start refocusing your attention on developing yourself. Take classes in the field you are interested in, form some new friendships and relationships to broaden you social network, and start therapy so you can find out why you were drawn to and stayed with a man who did not have your best interest at heart.

My friend is sad a lot because she is alone and doesn’t have a boyfriend. She always belittles herself and says she isn’t good enough. At first, I told her to be patient and focus on bettering herself and she would find someone soon. I now see that she is looking for someone else to be her main source of happiness. After pointing out to her what she was doing, I then told her that she can’t love anyone else until she learns to love herself. To which she responded, “I can’t love myself. I don’t know how to.” How can I help her?<|im_end|>

Based on the information presented in your letter, she may be someone who is struggling with self-esteem and needs professional guidance. Her inability to “love herself” may be an expression of depression or of her overall unhappiness in life. It’s common for people with depression to believe that they’re unlovable.It’s also possible that these problems may have originated, at least in part, with her family. Often, people who feel like she does, don’t feel loved or supported by their families, specifically their parents. Poor familial relationships may lead some to feel lost, unloved and depressed.You might have a better understanding of your friend and what she’s experiencing by studying Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. These needs must be fulfilled in order for an individual to be psychologically healthy and satisfied with life. Broadly speaking, it’s a psychological theory that explains what motivates human behavior.At the bottom of the hierarchy are physiological and safety needs. These involve food, water and shelter. These need to be met every day. It would be very difficult to function daily without satisfying these fundamental needs.The next two involve love and belonging, and self-esteem. Love and belonging refers to the idea of needing to feel that someone loves you. Often, this validation comes from one’s parents but it can also come from friends, family or a relationship with a higher power. Once someone knows that they are loved, they feel worthy of being loved. Perhaps if your friend felt loved, she’d find it easier to love herself.A similar thing is true regarding self-esteem. Self-esteem involves the idea of feeling “good enough to be accepted by others.” It’s common for young people to struggle with self-esteem issues often because of their age. Developmentally, young people are largely reliant on others. Self-esteem tends to come with age and independence but it mainly develops as a result of proving competence and doing things that you’re proud of. For instance, earning a college degree, getting a job, being a good parent, and so forth. At some point in one’s life, it will be important to feel validation about one’s abilities. Once that occurs, an individual is no longer driven to fulfill this need. This is not to say that they would stop attempting to accomplish things in life; it’s that they will no longer be driven by the need to prove that they are “good enough.”According to the theory, once all of the aforementioned needs are met, an individual is now ready for self-actualization. Self-actualization is a process of becoming fully who you are, your true self. I don’t have enough column space to describe all of the characteristics of self-actualizing people so I would recommend reading Abraham Maslow’s book about the subject. You should encourage your friend to read it as well.If depression is at the root of her problem, then she should consult a mental health professional. That type of help is beyond what you can provide as a friend. The main job of a caring friend is support and encouragement. Beyond that, there may be little else you can do. Psychological health, growth and development is a very personal matter. Hopefully, she will be open to treatment, should it be necessary. Good luck and please take care.<|im_end|>"

Is this normal behavior for a parent to neglect spending time with their kid(s)? Before I turned 10, my childhood was good and I have fond memories of my family hanging out / doing activities together. However, after reaching the age of 10, my father just stopped bothering to spend time with his children. Over the years he acts like he wants to hang out but when time rolls around for the activity to take place, always comes up with excuse to not hang out (be it family activities or spending time with individual family members). This obviously hurt my feelings as a child (mainly because I would try to follow things up) and he would always get angry at me. I’m now a 29 year old adult, and he still claims to want to hang out from time to time. However I really don’t believe him and get annoyed with this behavior because I know he won’t follow through. Problem I have, is not that he won’t hang out. If he doesn’t value his family enough to spend time with them, that’s fine. But he acts like everyone else is to blame for this (even though he suggests hanging out, and other people have to follow up to see if event is really taking place).<|im_end|>

 No, it’s not normal to neglect one’s children, but his behavior might be less about normalcy and more about his personality. He seems like someone who is avoidant and irresponsible.What your father might not understand is that when he make plans and doesn’t follow through, most people would consider him irresponsible and untrustworthy. Eventually people will stop making plans with him. That’s the normal and natural response towards people who do not keep their word.You shouldn’t feel bad about your wanting to distance yourself from your father. It’s the price he pays for behaving in this manner. Behavior has consequences and when his children decide to distance themselves from him then that’s the price he pays for his behavior. If he changed his behavior, then his children might not want to distance themselves from him and this would no longer be an issue. He has the ability to control his behavior. He has to be the one to decide to change his behavior. No one else can do it for him.The most important thing to realize about people, in general, is that you can’t change them. You can only react to how they treat you. The first time someone makes plans and doesn’t keep them, well maybe they were sick. That’s a legitimate excuse and it’s understandable; people get sick. But when they repeat the same behavior over and over, their excuses are no longer legitimate or believable and you have to adjust accordingly. In this case, it would be correct to stop making plans with someone who has repeatedly failed to keep their promises. A good rule of thumb is to treat people how they treat you, no better and no worse. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My best friend is suicidal and I want to know if there is anything I can do to help her. She has already told her parents but they really aren’t doing anything to stop her. I have told a teacher at our school and the counselor but all they do is recommend seeing a psychiatrist. I am really worried about her she almost always has cuts all over her body arms, legs, and stomach. Her mother has been in and out of prison even before she was born. Her mother is also in right now and has been since she was 7. In the past few years she has had a lot happen, she lost her grandmother on her dad’s side two days before Christmas in 2008. Right after that she moved from a big house to a small one and in the process lost connection with her former best friend. Many of her animals outside died and she sat with one of her cats and had to watch it die after it got attacked by a dog. This past year she had her aunt on her dad’s side die and lost a lot of her friends. She also found out that her mother was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by four different psychiatrists and borderline personality disorder by one or two. We were in seventh grade this year and for most of the second semester she was labeled a whore because of how she dresses and who hangs out with. This past summer is also when the cutting started it started off pretty bad but not frequent. It then went to minor burns and small scratches and then blew up again to bad cuts and they were very frequent. At the current moment she only has scars but is thinking about cutting herself again. I would just like an idea of what I could say to her to get her not to cut anymore. Thank you for taking the time to read this (and respond if you do).<|im_end|>

 First of all, your friend is lucky to have such a mature and concerned friend like you. For 13 years old, you are wise to get some advice on how to handle this serious situation. You mentioned that your friend is suicidal. Has she told you that she has plans to end her life or are you suspecting that she is suicidal because of her cutting behavior? Often intentional self-harm, or parasuicidal behavior, is a cry for help without an intention to die. The two are related but don’t necessarily go together.Does your friend acknowledge that she needs help to address her cutting? If so, she may want to ask her parents to take her to their family doctor. Sometimes parents are more willing to take their child to get “medical” help than “mental” help. Also, have you talked to your parents or guardian about this situation and asked for their help and advice? It may be a good idea to sit down with your friend and both sets of parents and express your love and concern and see how you and your parents can support your friend.  Another possible resource is Childhelp national hotline. You can tell them about your concerns with your friend and they will identify resources in your area.If your friend’s parents are fully aware that their daughter is cutting and in need of psychological intervention and they refuse to get their daughter the treatment she needs, then this may be a case of medical neglect requiring or your parents to report the situation to child protective services. I hope it doesn’t come to that. Thank you again for writing in to Ask the Therapist.Take good care of yourself.Julie Hanks, LCSW<|im_end|>"

From a teen in the Phillipines: I am diagnosed with Adjustment disorder with depressed mood for a year and am still currently taking medications for it. Sometimes I feel that the medications do not work at all and still feel depressed. However, there are also times that I feel like I am getting over it.<|im_end|>

 Please do talk this over with your psychiatrist. I can’t offer you a diagnosis on the basis of a letter. Your psychiatrist is in the position to do so.You may be correct that you haven’t been properly diagnosed. It’s also possible that you are reacting to your medication.You are an important member of your treatment team. Your doctor only has what you tell him or her to work with. To be really helpful, your doctor needs concrete information, not just your impressions about how you have been feeling and acting since your last visit.Keep a careful journal of your emotions and impulses between now and when you see your doctor. Record when you take your medications and your impression of the effect. Also, be sure to record how much you are sleeping each night. Write this information down every day. Take the journal to your appointment.Solid information will give your prescriber the information that is needed to assess your situation.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

My husband and I shared a long distance relationship for 6 years due to his employment 2500 miles away and my responsibilities here. We were married for 3 of those 6 years. We did the back and forth thing for the 6 years and finally decided for him to just move in with me. His law firm wasn’t doing so well as he was a sole practitioner and we decided he could probably do better here in NY. We had our normal ups and downs like every relationship but the stress of the long distance made it more difficult. While we were engaged I caught him on the computer talking with girls and sending them money which totally devastated me however I still married him weeks later. We tried marriage counseling briefly after the marriage. Because I couldn’t move past it and I continued to bring it up day after day for the last few years. I also found out he was financially struggling and I knew it, but didn’t know the extent of how bad until it was BAD. We had separate accounts and I wasn’t really kept in the loop of all the crazy loans he was taking out etc. I knew he had a rough childhood and felt worthless at times and I didn’t make matters better by constantly nagging that I’m the woman not him and its not fair that I have to pay my own way with no help for years. I also made more and didn’t throw money at him, maybe I should have. I had resentment because he was the man and I never wanted to part with my earned money because it was my security blanket. I thought when we were under one roof we could merge everything at that point. The night he hung himself was a week before he was supposed to finally live with me! We waited six years for this! I knew he was coming unemployed and I knew I could pay the rent and all my bills until he found a job. He had a free place to live until he got on his feet. However the night he did the unthinkable he brought up a horse and carriage ride we went on in NYC years ago and said what a great day it was. I texted back “yeah that’s when you loved me” he texted and “you don’t think I do now?” I said “no :-(” and he said “that doesn’t say much for me or my actions” and that night he hung himself. This is all my fault for doubting his love. I can’t even look at myself in the mirror! 1 week before we were FINALLY going to be together and I ruined it! It’s all my fault he’s dead.<|im_end|>

 I am so very sorry for your loss. It sounds as if your husband had a great many problems that were very long-standing and he kept you in the dark about many of them. You did not cause his death. Being honest about your feelings and the relationship would be what was necessary in any healthy relationship.Just like you weren’t able to heal things when they were not okay — you did not make things worse by telling the truth. Again, I am very sorry for your loss, but your husband made decisions that hid his problems, and he seemed unable to be available and open to you for a full relationship.I would begin seeing an individual counselor for grief counseling. Find help him with the top of the page will help you find someone in your area. This is the time for working through the sadness and grief, and eventually sorting through some of the reasons that kept you in a relationship with a number of unaddressed problems.Wishing you patience and peace, Dr. Dan Proof Positive Blog @ PsychCentralThe following Ask the Therapist query was submitted<|im_end|>"

I am 16 year old guy who considers himself to be straight. I know you will probably think I’m some kind of sick weirdo after what I’m about to say, but I have to get it off my chest. I used to have this really weird fetish. I used to go on omegle (online video chat room), look for an older guy (40s-50s), talk dirty in the chat and masturbate while he masturbated. This occurred about 3-4 times. Each time I tried not to show my face on the camera, and I covered my “area” (so the old guy only saw my hand motioning). The last time I did this was about 7 months ago. After doing it that last time, I realized how ****** up and disturbing it was. I don’t know why it turned me on, maybe just because it was out of the ordinary and erotic. I know I’m not gay because I only like girls, and I do not want to be in a relationship with a man. What I did has caused me nonstop anxiety, feelings of guilt, and depression. I now see how weird and wrong it was for me to do what I did, and I know that it will NEVER happen again. I can’t stop seeing myself as a horrible person and a weird sicko. Anytime something good happens in my life now, I feel like I don’t deserve it because of what I did. I feel like any other accomplishments that I have in life are diminished because of this one- time occurrence. Is my integrity as a person affected by what I have done? How can I get over my past? Should I be worrying like this? Do I need to tell my parents about this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.<|im_end|>

 You may have been driven by curiosity and an arousal to perform sexually in front of a stranger. The arousal often stems from a desire to be watched. What you may be describing is exhibitionism. Exhibitionism typically involves exposing one’s genitals to a stranger. In modern times, this often occurs via the Internet.You’re not a horrible person nor are you a “sicko.” Some people have a non-dangerous compulsion to show their genitalia to strangers. Some research has also found that it’s natural for men to want to look at other men’s genitalia. It’s not something to feel guilty about.While your desires might be psychologically explainable, they can lead to serious trouble. There are strict laws against individuals over the age of 18 interacting sexually with individuals under the age of 18. Had you (or the person viewing the webcam) been caught, you could’ve been prosecuted for engaging in unlawful sexual acts, and perhaps labeled a sex offender.You made a mistake and have since corrected it. When you realized that your behavior was wrong you stopped. You have behaved in a responsible manner. An irresponsible person knows what they are doing is wrong and makes no effort to stop. That is not what happened in your case.Your guilt over this incident is causing significant emotional distress. It should be addressed in counseling. Ask your parents to assist you in finding a therapist. A therapist could help you deal with your feelings of distress. Counseling is also the ideal place to discuss issues of sexuality. You’ll feel a lot better after talking this over with an objective, nonjudgmental, trained professional who can help ease your distress. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

Yesterday my mother was admitted into the hospital for what is apparently a severe case of depression. My mother is 49 years old and she had a minor heart attack about 4 months ago. About two weeks after that she had to have a hysterecomy. She was fine after that. All of a sudden for the past few days she’s been doing things that aren’t her. She’s been hiding my step father’s clothing under the bed and following him everywhere he goes whether it’s to the bathroom, to the kitchen, etc.. She calls my sister and tells her that there are weird things going on in the house. She says that my step father stole her car, when he’s been driving her car for the past year and she’s been driving the new car. She says he’s trying to erase her family’s numbers from her cell phone. My sister took her to the hospital where she was admitted. She has since deteriorated in her condition. She doesn’t recognize her own mother any more, when I call her she talks to me as if I’m a stranger. When my 1 year old neice who my mother is crazy about went to the hospital to visit her, mother just kept pushing her away. She kept asking what the plastic bag(that the hospital gives you to put your clothing in) in her room was for. She then thought that the same plastic bag was a gift for her. We just found out that she quit her job of 6 years last Thursday without letting anyone know. She won’t sleep, eat, or take the meds that the hospital is giving her so they are now going to transfer her to a mental facility. Please help my understand what is happening. This is not my mother and I am so confused. Is my mother going to stay this way? Please respond.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
I am sorry to hear about your mother. It’s difficult to say what is going on with her. The symptoms you describe do not seem related to depression but more related to some kind of psychosis. Something had to have triggered these symptoms you are describing. Physical causes MUST be ruled out before we should consider psychological factors. The hysterectomy may have resulted in a severe hormonal shift. A mild stroke or brain tumor are other possible physical causes. A reaction to medication is also a possible cause. It’s plausible that her recent physical problems and operation contributed to this recent breakdown in non-physical ways. It seems that some people are more vulnerable to stress than others. Sometimes physical problems can cause enough stress to a person that a breakdown occurs. I am familiar with a case of a woman who had a psychotic breakdown right after a hysterectomy. She actually went on to have many future breakdowns after her first one, but that was because she refused to take her medication. Left on her own to take the medication, she did not take it because she did not think she needed it. It was not until she was pushed to take her medication by her family that she stopped having psychotic episodes.What’s good is that she is admitted to the hospital where she is safe and can be treated for these psychotic symptoms. It is important that you and your family try and work with her doctors to find out more about what they think contributed to her breakdown and how you can help her take her medication. Her treating doctors should have more insight into what is going on and how best to treat it. Because it sounds more like a psychotic breakdown and not depression, having her take the medication at this point is probably the best way for her to return to her normal level of functioning.Since I do not have all of the facts, I am not sure what did happen to your mother. I cannot say if she will return back to normal or if she will stay this way. From what you describe, it sounds like she had a psychotic breakdown. The best treatment for psychosis is antipsychotic medications. I would recommend that you work closely with her doctors and find a way to help her take her medications so she can return back to herself and prevent any future breakdowns. If this is in fact a psychotic breakdown, it’s not uncommon that the person will refuse medication and fight about wanting to take it. Unfortunately, when they do stop with the medication, the person relapses and ends up back in the hospital. Research also posits that psychotic breakdowns cause brain damage. The most important way you can help is to make sure she finds a medication that can help her return back to normal and prevent future relapse and damage to the brain. Work with her doctors and social workers closely and ask many questions. I do wish you the best of luck.<|im_end|>"

I am a young boy. I listen to heavy metal (Ozzy Osborne and Marilyn Manson). I have a younger brother. My main problem is that I am very short (144cm) and everybody else in my age is tall, and I always think about become a king/emperor/leader and cutting off the legs of everybody who is taller than me so that they would be shorter. I cannot stop thinking about it, even in my dreams I always see blood and people without legs/people bowing down at my feet. I feel like all my “friends” secretly laugh at my height and that everybody hates me. My friends call me crazy sometimes. I also once almost killed my friend, when I was listening to music, I lost control of myself and I started strangling my best friend – I was stopped by another one of my friends and then I calmed down. My mother called me crazy for the first time when I smeared my whole face in my own blood. She thinks that I am mental and that I need to see a doctor. Am I really crazy or is it just “puberty”?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 The behavior you describe is quite serious and not likely the result of puberty. The only way in which biology or puberty affects this situation is related to height. At 11 years old, you are “short” now but you will grow taller. Growth spurts among males typically occur between the ages of 10 and 15. Your height may not be fully determined until at least 16 or 17 years old, and maybe later.I agree with your mother. It would be in your best interest to see a mental health professional. What’s most concerning is that you once lost control of yourself and attempted to strangle your best friend. It’s a definitive sign that you have the capacity to lose control and engage in violence. The concern is that such an event will happen again and you may seriously harm or kill another individual.Tell your mother you wrote this letter and show her my response. Insist that she take you to see a mental health professional. Treatment can greatly assist you in learning how to cope with your emotions and to develop healthy behaviors. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I have two sons, 17 and 19. The 17 year old has struggled throughout school with learning disabilities and since middle school has had to attend a school quite a distance away. He is now a senior in high school. His time in the public school was not a happy one and he didn’t have any strong relationships with peers when he left, so it was difficult to maintain friendships in our town. He has friends in school, but they live an hour away so they don’t get together outside of school often. My 19 year old is the opposite – always did well in school, has a very strong social circle that he does things with all the time. Gets up, goes out for coffee with them. Comes home for a period of time, then goes out again with them for some activity – basketball, watching a game on TV, playing XBox, etc. Then comes home for dinner, and goes out with them again after dinner for the evening. He is in college, so this is happening over the winter break and sometimes over summer when he is not working. While my older son is happily busy with friends, the younger one is sitting home, miserable and depressed because he doesn’t have anything to do or any friends to hang out with. He is very shy, and despite our attempts to help him make friends locally, it hasn’t happened. He does work over the summer, which helps, but can’t during the school year because of the distance he travels to school. The younger one would love it if the older one would choose to spend some time with him, and they do get along well when they are together. We have talked to my older son about spending time with his brother, and he agrees, but never makes the time to do it. How much should we push this? I don’t want to create animosity between them by forcing the older one to hang out with his brother once in a while instead of his friends. I find myself getting angry at my older son that he doesn’t see how sad his brother is and step in to help. Of course, my husband and I would love to spend time with the 18 year old but that’s the last thing he wants! (From the USA)<|im_end|>

 I’m sure this is very frustrating. Please bear in mind that many parents don’t want to acknowledge the seriousness of a child’s problem, not because they are mean or neglectful but because it just hurts their heart too much. Parents also sometimes worry that their kid’s problem is their fault. They don’t know what to do about it and may feel helpless to change things. I don’t know what goes on with your parents. I do know you need to find another way to talk to them besides arguing with them or blaming them.You need a thorough evaluation to see what you really need. Perhaps one way to persuade your parents is to ask them to allow such an evaluation. Tell them that if the psychologist agrees you don’t have a significant problem, you will let it go and will double down on your self-care and self management. But will they agree to treatment if the evaluation shows that you are on the autism spectrum or have a significant mental health disorder?Other resources for you may be your school guidance counselor or a teacher you trust or your doctor. Parents will often respond better to another adult than to their kid. See if someone you trust can advocate for you.I doubt online treatment will be helpful. You need a good diagnostic evaluation first.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

 I’m terribly sorry you are dealing with such difficult issues. I hope you are getting your son and your family some therapy as well as legal help. This is a situation that has many, many layers to it. Your son needs treatment. You need support and help understanding how to be helpful. You and your husband need to find a way to work as a team through this crisis or you won’t have a marriage left.It sounds to me like your husband hasn’t fully embraced your son as his own. From his point of view, he signed on to be a dad in a “normal” family. He didn’t understand that letting kids into our hearts means sometimes having our hearts broken. It may be that he can’t stand it so he’s distancing himself by making your son into an “other,” something that isn’t related to him. That’s at least one possible explanation. There are others, of course. It may be that your son’s behavior has triggered other painful memories, feelings, or thoughts in him that your husband can’t understand or grapple with.All you can do is share with him that you need him and ask him to go to therapy with you in an attempt to salvage the marriage while you help your son. My heart goes out to all of you, as well as to victim and his family. This is incredibly painful for everyone.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

So, ever since I was a wee-little lad, I have been in Dance classes, and I enjoy it! Just Because I prefer “dancing” over “football”, according to everyone in my school: I’m gay. When I got into 6th Grade, the bullying started getting really bad. People were messing with my head, and I started to get really depressed. I remember my first time cutting. I used a razor in the shower. The release felt amazing- and it helped me totally forget about all of the emotional pain that had been building up inside of me for however many years. Ever since that first time cutting, I feel like I am “addicted” to cutting or something. Now, whenever I get tripped in the hallway at school, get into an argument with my mom, or EVEN if I get angry over the stupidest things. It’s gotten to the point, where most times, I don’t even have a reason to do it. I just do. My scars are really visible, as are the newer cuts (that I’ve done in the past couple of days). It’s confusing, because I keep trying to tell myself that I want to stop, but my head keeps on telling me that It’s okay. It’s really dangerous because it REALLY works, and it is the ONLY way I know how to deal with my problems, and cope with my past. I get bullied all the time at school, which only adds more stress, and makes me cut more. I have been diagnosed with Anxiety Disorder, but I think I have depression. My mom knows I used to cut, but she thinks I stopped a year ago. Little does she know. My cuts are getting deeper every time I do it now. She told me (back when she knew I was doing it before) That if she found out I was doing it again, she would send me to a Psych ward. I just dont know what to do anymore. Please Help.<|im_end|>

 I can understand the struggle and deeply appreciate you talking about this and sending your email. The most important thing I can say is that a “psych ward” isn’t what is needed. You are clearly a bright and talented student who has been struggling to find a way to cope with his pain, and what I can tell you is there are many other ways of coping that won’t put your well-being at risk. You are not familiar with these ways, but a good therapist will be. Ask your mom about going to talk to a therapist about how you are feeling. That is the truth, and my guess is she will honor your request. Then tell the therapist everything you explained here and you and he or she will make a plan for coping from there. Many teenagers and young adults have found alternative to cutting that have proven to be helpful. My hope is that you will too.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

Thank you for providing a lot of detail with your question but unfortunately, I am not clear what specific question is. I am not sure if you are asking about how to stop fantasizing about “coach” or something else. I was also unclear about if you were attracted to “coach” or if he was just a bother to you and you needed help getting rid of him. I will offer a general answer since I am not sure about what exactly you are asking.Most everyone fantasizes. Studies show that it is very common and normal. People who are married have fantasies as do single people. As free thinkers, we are allowed to think about anything or anyone we want. Fantasizing and acting out a fantasy are very different things. Fantasy is far different from reality and what people fantasize about is often much more than they would actually do or find pleasure in doing.Thinking about anything and whomever you want is fine as long as you can control your actions, your fantasies do not turn into an obsession, and you can decipher fantasy from reality. It would be inappropriate, of course, as a married woman to have an affair with “coach.” It seems as if you are wise enough to realize this and that is why you are in therapy.I think you made the right move by starting therapy. As you said it has already helped your marriage. You did exactly what you should have done. Therapy is what I would have suggested had you not mentioned that you began going some months ago.I would not recommend that you spend any time with coach, public or private. How can you resolve this situation? If your answer to coach is “no”, then you must find a much, much more powerful way to say no. Like “I’m married and do not ever bother me again or I will tell everyone exactly what you are like and what you are after.” No more phone calls about anything. If he has to talk about your son, he can talk to your husband. There is no more pretending that “nothing is going on.” Something is very definitely going on and you have altered your behavior and even begun early therapy to deal with what is “going on.”I hope I have answered your question. But if not, and you would like a more nuanced answer please consider writing back in and asking a more direct question. Take care.<|im_end|>"

This relationship seems very one-sided. You felt that you were carrying the weight of the relationship. You helped her but she didn’t help you. One-sided relationships are always off-balance. They never last long.It is important to realize that her behavior may not have anything to do with you. In other words, it may not be personal. It is more likely that she is reacting to her untreated anxiety and depression. Mental illness complicates interpersonal relationships.You both may have expected too much from each other. You shouldn’t expect her to treat your mental health problems nor you hers. That’s the job of professionals.Given your admitted mental health conditions, I would encourage you to consult a therapist. Encourage her to do the same. Professional therapists are trained to treat the types of problems with which both of you are struggling. Once treatment begins, the friendship may naturally resume. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My boyfriend is diagnosed as bipolar, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder and anxiety disorders. He has recently in the past year quit taking medications for it. He has tried a number of medications and none of them have worked. We have been doing research recently about the symptoms he has been having. We have found that the closest thing to his symptoms that we have found is he has been having Hypnagogic Hallucinations. He wakes up in the middle of the night freaking out. He is terrified to go to sleep. He stays up for a couple days sometimes because he is so afraid to sleep. Could this be a sleeping disorder? Or could it have something to do with the mental illnesses that he has been diagnosed with? He has been through so many medications and none of them have helped at all. Most of them have just made him almost dead inside. Just lying in bed all day and never wanting to do anything. Is there anyone else out there with these same diagnoses? and if so what helped for them? Thanks, Hannah.<|im_end|>

 Hello Hannah. It is difficult to determine what is causing your boyfriend’s sleep problems. There are many possibilities. Medications can cause sleep disturbances.You also mentioned that he has a number of psychiatric diagnoses. The fact that he is currently not on medication may mean that he is symptomatic. Those symptoms could potentially be causing his sleep problems. Again, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the problem. There are many variables.I would recommend that your boyfriend be evaluated by a physician. The physician can refer him to a local sleep disorder clinic. If your boyfriend has health insurance, that is a good place to start. He should also contact a psychiatrist for a thorough psychiatric evaluation.It is also concerning that he has stopped taking his medication without supervision. I understand medications can have unpleasant side effects but it is not wise to abruptly stop taking psychiatric medications. Your boyfriend should have spoken to his psychiatrist or his prescribing physician about this before stopping the medication. The psychiatrist or physician could have advised him about the safest way to discontinue his medication.The bottom line is that there is no easy answer to this question. Your boyfriend needs to be evaluated by medical and psychiatric professionals to determine what may be contributing to his sleep problems. Encourage him to be evaluated as soon as possible. Offer your support during this process. It can only help. I wish you well. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

 I can’t tell for sure, of course, but you may be on to something. One way to describe OCD is that the “enough” switch in the brain malfunctions. Once a person with OCD gets focused on something, he often can’t let go. In an argument, this can look like a relentless obsession with making a point. So it could be that you are correct that this is a remaining symptom of your prior OCD.It could also be that because of the OCD is prior years, you didn’t learn how to argue effectively. Once triggered into a defensive mode, all you know how to do is insist on your belief that you are “right” by repeating the same points, even though they are trivial. If that may be the case, a question to ask yourself is why it is that you feel “attacked”, by someone you love who only wants to solve a problem. It may be that some experience in the past makes this kind of situation feel threatening. If so, it’s important to get to the bottom of it and to identify ways to feel safe when in a confrontation.Or it may be something else entirely. Those are the best ideas I have with the limited information.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I am a 15-year-old guy who considered himself heterosexual. About 8 months ago I went on a video chat website that randomly pairs you with a stranger to chat with over the camera. I went on this website, skipped through a few people, found an older man who had his area exposed, and I masturbated with him. I did not show my face, I covered my privates while I did it, and the man stopped halfway through (I did not tell him my age). I know that what I did sounds very freakish. I have not done it for the past 8 months, and I know that I will never do it again in my life. I can’t get over what I did, I feel depressed, and I feel like everything in my life is ruined because of this mistake. I am mostly upset because I am a straight guy and have no interest in men. I don’t know why I did this, and I am truly sorry. Is there any way I can get over this? Is my integrity as a person affected by this mistake? Do I have to tell my parents about it? I’m sorry this was long, thank you for your time.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I’m sorry that you have been so affected by this mistake, but the up side is that I feel more confident that you mean it when you say that you won’t do it again. I’m not at all concerned that you were exploring your sexuality in new and different ways. It is quite normal to be curious, it is not freakish at all and your integrity as a person should not be affected. As for your sexual orientation, sexuality is best understood as a continuum and many people experiment, especially during their teens and early 20’s. So this one act will not change who you are and who you will ultimately be attracted to.The part that concerns me is that you are a minor and you shared a sexual act with an adult over the Internet. I am not a police officer or an attorney, but I know there are strict laws against this kind of thing. It is for this reason that I would advise you to refrain from this type of activity. I have known people that have even gotten in legal trouble for what is considered “sexting.” Sharing graphic pictures over any form of public media is dangerous and can be illegal. In this case, it would most likely be the older man who would be more in the wrong, but I want to caution you against it.I don’t necessarily feel that you need to tell your parents unless you think it would help you feel better and put this whole thing behind you. You could also confide in another adult you trust such as a teacher, coach, minister, or another family member. Again, you don’t have to, it just might help relieve your guilty conscious and move on. Someday this whole thing will just be a blip in your life and you may even forget about it. Don’t let it hold you back any longer.All the best,<|im_end|>"

It is a brave thing to open yourself up to feedback here and I think everything you are talking about has more to do with you being fifteen years old than a personality disorder. As a teenager, you will be more egocentric than what will typically be true for you later in life. It is a very well-established fact that adolescent egocentrism is part of the developmental process and it is a necessary stage in development. According to adolescent psychologists, it may actually have a lot to do with future healthy psychological growth.It is natural to think about the things you are thinking of- for the most part. The parts of your character that you’ll want to be more mindful of try to change are those parts that lie to get what you want and thinking you are always right. These are common character flaws that will not serve you well as you mature. Struggle to be more honest with yourself and others—and listen more to what others have to say. This will help keep you more balanced as you mature.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

My relationship with my mother in law is dragging me down. She routinely criticizes, slights, and insults me. This is usually done in a sly enough manner that it’s hard to challenge her behavior directly without feeling as though I’m overreacting. It’s her attitude that’s the problem. She has been condescending and catty from day one of our marriage. I believe she lives under a lot of self-imposed guilt and when she sees me being happy and carefree, it activates her anxieties and she wants to bring me down.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I think you are trying to manage a very difficult situation, and feeling the struggle of trying to provide balance in the family. While it is hard to know for sure, your analysis of why she is like this is certainly in keeping with relevant theories on this type of passive-aggressive behavior. This is difficult, but I do think there are strategies that might help.From your description your mother-in-law doesn’t sound like she knows or cares that she has this impact on you. You will need several tools to unhook from her cattiness and sly remarks. The main feature is to not let her activate your defensiveness. In other words, the work here is to ‘detach with love’ as the Al-Anon programs might say, and don’t take any of her bait.There are three strategies that tend to work in these situations, and they come in varying degrees of leverage. All three have one thing in common, and that is to leave the discomfort with her rather than with you. This is not antagonistic, but rather leaving the problem at its origin, with her.In his classic book, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values, Robert M. Pirsig referred to the fact that the Japanese have a notice at the beginning of their instructions on how to assemble a new purchase. The notice says (I am paraphrasing): “To begin, the assembler must be in the right frame of mind.” This is where you begin with your encounter with her. Begin in the right frame of mind, which is: This is her issue — do not let it become yours.When she says an unkind comment or criticism offer back a simple descriptive statement of what she said: “It sounds like you’re unhappy with how I keep my home.” Or: “You seem disappointed in what was served for dinner.” In other words, let her criticisms and persecutions be hers. Again, don’t take the bait and feel the need to defend yourself. A descriptive statement allows you to stay present but not become overwhelmed by her taunts.The second coping method is to respond with a statement that directly identifies the fact that the issue is hers. “It must be hard for you to feel so disappointed so often.” Or: “It seems like you are unhappy when you are here.”The third encounter has a uniqueness to it because it is twofold. It uses a question as a way of undoing the hurtfulness behind her condescending or persecuting manner. After she has said something hurtful, ask a question: “When you say things like that, do you ever wonder what it might be like for me to hear?” “Or: “Are you aware how often you say things like that?” Or: “Are you this unhappy when you are at home?”The second part of this depends on you, and what you feel is appropriate. The stance is the same: This is her issue; do not let it become yours. After she answers the question you may use the other strategies to stay engaged without becoming defensive.Typically someone like your mother-in-law is skilled in not taking responsibility for his or her passive-aggressive hurtfulness, so a direct confrontation is usually unproductive. But offering some feedback in this second part might be helpful, as long as you keep your expectations low. After asking one of the questions in the previous paragraph, you might try adding something like: “…because when you say things like that it makes it hard for me to be around you.”Don’t feel the need to explain or defend yourself. Doing so will get you nowhere but more frustrated. Just say what you feel is factual, then go back to the other strategies without trying to defend or criticize. Your job here is to protect yourself from feeling overwhelmed. With some practice your mother-in-law will learn that she isn’t upsetting you, but that her insults land back on her doorstep.If your husband is agreeable you might ask him to help role-play with you to build up your skill. This may help the two of you bond over the issue as well.Good luck with this. It will take you a while to get good at responding but in the words of the great Eleanor Roosevelt: “No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.”Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

For a couple of years, my mind have been twisted. I see things, think things, which make me believe I’m not quite like the others. I’ve seen different people here who think they might be evil, but none of them really got quite the grasp of true, devastating evil.<|im_end|>

 Evil is a concept that belongs to philosophy and religion. There is no mention of evil in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM) version 5. Every mental health disorder is listed in the DSM-5.What you have described are fantasies of hurting other people or of actual examples of you hurting people verbally. According to your letter, you haven’t actually physically harmed anyone and have done little more than verbally attack another, something almost everyone, at some stage of their life, has been guilty of.Your letter to me also indicates that your thoughts and fantasies focus on your power over others. Generally, when someone fantasizes or daydreams about having power they themselves feel weak. Thus they daydream and fantasize about what they want and do not have.Power can be related to age. Children of course have no power. Adults do. The period between childhood and adulthood is all about gaining independence, gaining power.If you were my client, the first thing that I would do would be assess the degree of power that you actually possess. Are you being picked on? Have you been picked on? Do you have major fears? If so, we would address those things in therapy.The type of fantasies that you have described are very common with people, especially teenagers and children, who have been mistreated, abused or bullied.Could you do the things that you have described? Yes, you have the power to do that but so do I and so do most people. Most people choose not to do it. I choose not to do it and so far you have chosen not to do it. Acting in an evil way, hurting or not hurting others, is a choice. It’s not a matter of power. It’s not as if anyone who had the power to be evil, would choose to do evil. Simply having the power to do evil does not make someone evil. Having fantasies about hurting others also does not make one evil. Having fantasies about having great power over others, as demonstrated by the harm and the control that is possessed in the fantasy, is very common in those that have been the victim and not the victimizer.I don’t know you but I would guess that you are not evil. My guess, and without a therapeutic evaluation it is only a guess, is that you have had a rough or incomplete childhood and would benefit greatly from the guidance and insight offered to you by a good therapist. A good therapist can repair the damage and provide the missing pieces of growth that can result from a less than ideal childhood.You’ve done nothing wrong yet. By hurting others, you will destroy your own life. I’m sure you’re aware of that. The good news is, you have harmed others only in your fantasies. You have not brought harm to others and thus have not hurt yourself.My advice to you is to find a good therapist before there is any chance of you making a mistake that could and likely would destroy your life. What you have described is fairly common with teenagers and is easily corrected in counseling or therapy.Please take my advice and I wish you the best of luck.<|im_end|>"

 Lonely kids often create imaginary friends to fill the void. You seem to have a more active imagination than most. Since you are able to socialize and you can switch it off, it’s not clear to me whether this has become a psychological problem or if you are developing a talent for creative writing. If you were seeing me for counseling, one suggestion I would make is to start writing to see if putting the ideas “on paper” would help you channel your tendency to create scenarios.Since you have a diagnosis, I’m assuming you also have a counselor. If you don’t, I encourage you to get one. Please don’t be ashamed of sharing what you’ve shared here. A therapist will not judge you but will instead help you decide if this is a talent you should nurture or a problem you should solve — or both.I wish you well, <|im_end|>"

My uncle has severe paranoid Schizophrenia. His sister may have been mentally ill – she had lifelong substance abuse/addiction problems. Their brother molested them all during childhood.

 It is believed that schizophrenia has a genetic component, but that does not mean that the offspring of people with schizophrenia will develop the illness. The increased risk for the offspring is slight. There are many other factors that would need to be present for schizophrenia to develop. Genetics is only part of the story.The majority of people who develop schizophrenia have experienced trauma, often many traumas, throughout the course of their lives. Drug use is also a factor as are many other psychosocial factors including stress, head injury, and so forth.The fact remains that there is no certainty about the causes of schizophrenia or any other mental illness. Differing theories exist, but there is no universally accepted answer. It is unlikely that you will receive a definitive answer to your question. Science, at this point in time, cannot provide those answers.There is no guarantee that your children will not develop schizophrenia but based on the information you have provided, the probability is very low, perhaps no more so than anyone without your family history. Your fear about their developing schizophrenia should match the actual, factual probability that exists. Your fear should be minimal.All of us should strive for psychological health. You and your husband should strive to be as psychologically healthy as you can be for your children, should you choose to have them. That means that if you or he believed that something was psychologically wrong, then the proper course of action would be to seek treatment from mental health professionals. That’s the best way to protect and preserve psychological health.Evidence-based mental health treatments exist and are very effective. The problem isn’t treatment ineffectiveness; it’s that many people who have mental health problems don’t seek treatment for them. There are many reasons why people don’t seek treatment, but stigma is chief among them. Many people erroneously believe that seeking mental health treatment is a sign of weakness. It is a sad fact that many people are needlessly suffering with treatable conditions.You said that you and your family have “never encountered a schizophrenic that didn’t deteriorate into oblivion.” That is not my experience, and I’ve worked with many people with schizophrenia. Research shows that people with schizophrenia who participate in treatment can live high-quality and fulfilling lives. Elyn Saks, a UCLA psychiatrist, is one example that comes to mind. You might try reading about her story.Your fears about having children who will develop a serious mental illness (SMI) seem to be inconsistent with the reality of the situation. Only 6% of the United States general population has an SMI (i.e. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depression). You might consider counseling to help you address your fears and to align your feelings with reality. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

In the past I have been cheated on and watch family members cheat. I have experiences both being cheated on and watching family members do this multiple times. Right now I have started a relationship with someone I find myself falling for quite quickly and seems to have all the checkmarks in the right places. I have known him for about a year now but we have been dating for about five weeks and I have noticed that I am feeling insecure and scared that he also might cheat on me. I strut around confidently so it came as a shock when I told him about being cheated on and seeing my family get hurt by it as well. When people started to find out we were dating, some people, and one female in particular messaged him. We all worked together and I didn’t like her too much because she always wanted to start drama and I’m afraid she is trying to do that here as well.<|im_end|>

 I would highly recommend you watch this video by Brene Brown. She discusses the vulnerability of relationships. Part of our coping strategy as humans is to realize that we are always vulnerable and to use this vulnerability in ways to strengthen ourselves and others.Well this is a bit overwhelming at first, it provides us a way of savoring good things when they are happening, and sharing our vulnerabilities with others. In other words, the investment has to be to both celebrate the quality of the relationship when it is good, and share the vulnerability with each other when you are scared.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I was in a relationship for two years throughout high school. It was my first “real” relationship and I fell in love with him. I thought we were going to try to make it work through college even though it would be hard because we loved each other so much. However, he randomly broke up with me before the summer even started. He wouldn’t tell me why or what had gone so wrong. Naturally, I was absolutely devastated. He just dropped out of my life completely.<|im_end|>

 Some people never fully “get over” their first real love. Many people will always remember their first real love interest and some people say they will always love that person. It doesn’t, however, prevent them from going on to have successful, happy and better relationships with other people. They do and you will also likely do the same.With breakups, there’s almost always one person who doesn’t want the relationship to end. Rarely is it the case that breakups are mutual. Usually, someone is hurt. In this case, it is you. Most people can relate because they too have been on the receiving end of a breakup.The purpose of dating is to find someone with whom you are compatible. In the majority of cases, the people you date will not be a match. They will be rejected for one reason or another. That is okay because that is the purpose of dating.As you continue through life, you will date other people. This particular breakup is probably more difficult because you were heavily invested in the relationship and you have yet to meet someone else. Once you meet new people, your feelings for your ex will likely dissipate. Maybe not entirely, but a great deal. Eventually your first love will be all but forgotten.Consider counseling. In my opinion, there is no better way to ease the pain of a breakup. Relationship issues are one of the main reasons why people enter counseling. It is the ideal place to address these issues. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I’m feel like there is something seriously wrong with my head and I just don’t know what it is? I’ve researched a lot of different mental disorders and I can relate to a lot of the symptoms of so many of them. When I was in 4th grade I was diagnosed with ADD and I’ve have had on and off depression, disordered eating habits, and anxiety since then but I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety 3 months ago. Lately I have been feeling very disconnected and can’t stop zoning out, when I’m not zoned out my vision is distorted. Everything looks like its shifting, breathing, certain things pop out a lot, and when I read text it waves and spirals into itself. Sometimes when I walk I feel the curve of the earth and everything to the side of me looks downhill. Kind of like tripping but not. I did do LSD twice about 5 months ago but I’ve only been experiencing these symptoms for 2 or 3 months so it’s not because of the acid. I question reality and get confused about the concept of time and sometimes I completely forget who I am. Also been having bad insomnia and strange sleep patterns. I’ve been impulsive and doing things that I regret later; smoking a lot more than usual, drinking all the time and trying other harder drugs like Xanax and coke(once) but thats weird for me because I’ve always thought of myself as weed only. I’ve also been hooking up with a lot more guys which is weird for me because I’ve always been kind of afraid of and have never been in a relationship and am very self conscious but I keep hooking up with guys I don’t care about. I also just really hate my personality. I try to seem unique but really I have no personality, I’ m nothing but a bunch of stolen identities. When I ask someone to hang out and they can’t I get extremely hurt by that to the point of tears and think that everyone thinks I’m annoying and that girl that I think is cool and I wish people could see me the same way as people see her knows that I’m copying her. Sometimes I’m afraid to go on the deck because I think I can’t control myself and I might jump off.<|im_end|>

 It’s not possible to determine a diagnosis over the Internet. The other issue is your age. Some mental health professionals are reluctant to diagnose teenagers with a mental illness because it is a turbulent time, both developmentally and emotionally.When mental health problems are a concern, it is especially important to refrain from using drugs and alcohol. They can negatively impact your mood and personality. They could make your symptoms worse or perhaps may even be causing them. Therefore it would be in your best interest to stop using drugs and alcohol.It was your opinion that you don’t possess a “unique personality ” and that you are a conglomeration of a “bunch of stolen identities.” What I think you might mean is that you are behaving in ways that you believe other people want you to instead of just being yourself. That could stem from low self-esteem.Lack of self-esteem might also be evidenced by your “hooking up with guys [you] don’t care about.” You might not be so willing to indiscriminately “hook up” with these people if you felt better about yourself.You have received different diagnoses. This would suggest that you have been evaluated by a mental health clinician. It’s good that you were in contact with mental health professionals, but you did not mention being in treatment. Counseling is the ideal treatment for the problems you have described. Medication could also help with your symptoms.Erik Erikson is a famous and well-accepted developmental theorist. He talks about a stage that people go through when growing up. It is called identity vs. identity confusion. In essence he is saying that a teenager must go through a stage where they will find out who they are. They need to find their identity. You can read about this and see if it explains some of your feelings.The symptoms you described require treatment. Contact a mental health professional and ask for his or her assistance. What’s most important is treating your symptoms with counseling and if necessary, medication. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I dated someone normal and emotionally stable for over 5 years. We never fought, I was extremely bored (person did not have much education, not many friends) and felt unsatisfied emotionally and sexually. Now for the last 8 months I have been in relationship with someone just the opposite: very passionate, handsome, smart, charismatic, but emotionally unstable. We fight way too much for different reasons. I feel like I love him, but I am so tired of fighting. Recently I started feeling like I cause the fights, and that I am crazy. One recent thing that is a big issue now is jealousy. My bf is a photographer/artist, and he admires female beauty so much. He also teaches college, and all of his students are 20-22 years old! Maybe it would not be a problem, but he thinks that young females (17-22) are the most sexually desirable and beautiful, as they are young and haven’t gained any weight. At the same time, he compliments me all the time, telling me how beautiful and perfect I am, that I am the best woman he has ever met, how much he wants to marry me and so on. But I, maybe due to being insecure, can’t help but feel old at 29. I feel so depressed that I get angry even seeing tall model-looking teenage girls now. I never felt this way before. No wonder I lost 23 pounds without ANY dieting/exercising in less than a year with no intention, or at least no conscious intention of doing so. I am 5’7′ and now size 2 (used to be 4-6). I am a good-looking girl, very successful career-wise, but I still feel inadequate. I spend too much time thinking that 10 years from now, if we were to have family, I will be making good money with my stable job (he never has money), while he is flirting with his 20 year old students. Maybe taking pictures of females. Not because he wants them, as he said, but just because women are beautiful and the images are great. Maybe my problem is that I, being insecure, got into the relationship with a visual artist guy. Even though he says that I mean everything to him, I feel in so much pain on a regular basis. I get sad, angry, and don’t know what to do at all. Thank you for any advice. (age 29, from US)<|im_end|>

 Thank you for writing in with your question. From what you are saying here, it doesn’t sound like your boyfriend is necessarily doing anything wrong, except objectifying women’s bodies — (is it art or objectification?). You also describe him as emotionally unstable but I’m not sure what you mean by that exactly. So, the problem may be mostly yours and stemming from your self-described insecurity and jealousy.I’m concerned that you lost so much weight while dating him and I’m concerned that you have found a partner who appears to be so focused on outward beauty. What you are describing is not a good combination.I think it would be a good idea to see a therapist who specializes in body image/eating disorders just to make sure you make your decisions about this relationship from a healthy place. Once you do this, you may also benefit from some couple’s counseling to work on the fighting and emotional ups and down you both experience. Before you can work on the relationship’s future potential, you need to get a better handle on what is going on right now. Perhaps the ideal person for you is somewhere in between “boring” and “emotionally unstable,” but what is most important is loving yourself and knowing that you are worth it.All the best,<|im_end|>"

My boyfriend and I have no contact for five weeks. We were both hospitalize for depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicide attempts. We became each others motivation to live. But now end-year exams starts and all communications are gone. Not even one text on weekends. It’s the first week out of five and I already got suicidal today and self-harmed for the first time in months. I started smoking again and I’m permanently with a cigarette in my hand. I honestly don’t know how I’m going to survive this, and the fact that he’s suicidal as well just means he’s probably going through the same thing. What if he doesn’t make it? I’m seeing a psychiatrist once a week, but I skip it these days to study plus I don’t really like talking about myself having a low self-esteem.. but I’m just scared now. Scared of myself. I can’t focus on the exams while I feel like this. Every second is torture. what hope can possibly be left? (From South Africa)<|im_end|>

 What you want to do is focus on your self-care very intensely. You have no control over how your boyfriend will respond — but you do have a choice about how you will respond. Please keep your psychiatrist’s appointment. You will want to take care of yourself for two good reasons. First, if this is a phase he is going through you’ll want to be in a good, or at least better, place when he is able. If he isn’t able to maintain the relationship you’ll want to be strong enough to manage. This will require you having as much support as you can muster.Self care is the most important thing you can do during a time of relational crisis. This means treating yourself well by getting enough sleep, eating well and not doing things that bring you down. I’d devote my energy to the things you can do to bring you to and keep you in a better place. Your psychiatrist knows you and can be important in helping you through this time. Reconnect to your therapy and do everything you can to nurture yourself.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

I think this boy that goes to my school is obsessed with me. We met through skype and he hasn’t given me a moment to myself since. He’s a very good friend but he wants to talk/call with me every single day and i need some time to myself. During school he follows me around all day sometimes without even saying anything. I almost always have to start the conversations. He is so quiet because he told me that he gets very bad stomach aches and starts shaking whenever he is near me. He still has these even though we have been talking almost every day since august. I don’t like to see him sick like this but he insists on always being with me. He told me he wants to go out with me but i told him i just want to be friends. I feel awful because he likes me a lot but I don’t feel the same way. In January i finally told him that i needed some time to myself but he started crying and he kept apologizing that he was such a pest and he said he would leave me alone. I didn’t want to make him cry so in an effort to calm him down I told him I didn’t mean it and I don’t actually think that.He also gets mad if I do something he doesn’t like, some examples are when we first started talking I didn’t say good morning enough to him. He told me he felt like I didn’t care about him and he was very angry with me because of this, he started texting to me in all caps and looked annoyed at school. I thought it was an extremely stupid thing to get upset about. Another time was when my friends downloaded halo(a pc game)at school and I played it with them “too much” in the morning before school (20mins). He told me I was being very selfish because I wouldn’t have a conversation with him. So I stopped. But he is still quiet when around me. More recently he told me he has been suicidal and is extremely depressed because we haven’t been calling enough even though we text every.single.day. I don’t know what to do and I don’t want to hurt his feelings or worse. help. (From the USA)<|im_end|>

  It sounds like you already know what to do but aren’t quite able to do it yet. That is a different thing than not knowing. You sound very clear that you do not like to be smothered by this boy, feel too controlled by him, that he makes you feel guilty, and is blaming you for his depression and suicidal thoughts. None of this is okay. The fact that he has shared that he has been suicidal changes everything. This is not healthy — and not something you can manage on your own. I would immediately talk to the guidance counselor in your high school and let him or her know that this is going on. Your friend needs help and you being nice to him because you are worried about him emotionally is an indication that he needs more help than you can give. In some ways it is like being bullied: he uses he emotions to try and control your behavior.Please make this a priority. Your friend needs help from others. The best thing you can do as a friend is help him best by letting others know he is having thoughts of hurting himself.Wishing you patience and peace, <|im_end|>"

For a while now, I have shown symptoms of depression as well as social anxiety. I talked to a therapist about whatever I could. I told him about some other things like the repetitive tasks I must perform out of fear, my derealization experiences, etc. All he told me was that I was experiencing a lot of anxiety. I’m not sure if I explained myself too well or if he doesn’t necessarily want to tell me about what may be going on. This is quite frustrating, because I need help. Terribly!<|im_end|>

 It seems as though you have spoken with your therapist about your social anxiety but not your suicidal or homicidal thoughts. You should not keep those from your therapist. It is very important that you discuss those thoughts with your therapist. It should be the very first thing you discuss in your next therapy session.You’re not alone in your homicidal fantasies. These fantasies often involve becoming an all-powerful, entity of destruction. Desire for infamy is a desire to be seen as important, to get attention. People feel this way when there are suffering and they lack power in their own lives.It’s difficult to tolerate all the negativity in your world, especially when you’re in pain and don’t have the power to stop it.But you have a choice as to how you move forward. You can choose to seek help or to act on your strong emotions, which in all likelihood, are temporary and will eventually subside.Many, many people at 14, the teenage years, have difficult lives. The world can seem oppressive but that changes as you age, mature and grow. It’s best to seek help during this turbulent time.Even without help, many people learn that eventually life gets better in time. That’s the core message from people who have attempted suicide and who have survived. They discovered that their lives got better and thankfully, were alive to see it happen.Killing, mass murders, etc., are as much a form of suicide as homicide. The consequence of murder is, for all practical purposes, the ending of your own life. You will be killed during the homicide or perhaps executed, after being caught, or live a nearly unimaginable life of degradation in prison, until you commit suicide or your heart naturally stops beating.Damien Echols, of the West Memphis Three, spent 18 years incarcerated for a crime he did not commit. He was eventually released and described prison as “the coldest, most empty place…you’re dealing with some of the most sadistic elements of humanity there… I can’t even articulate how bad it is, how vile and revolting it is.”I don’t think you want that kind of life.Ronald Siegal, Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School, is right when he says you are not our thoughts. “We think our thoughts actually mean something. In fact we think we are our thoughts and our thoughts are us… Sometimes [your thoughts] are downright ridiculous. Just because you think it, doesn’t make it true.”He’s exactly right. Many people have irrational, ridiculous thoughts but they don’t necessarily mean anything. They might be evidence of suffering and a sign that an individual should seek help but they should not necessarily be thought of as important. Fantasies are meant for exploring thoughts and ideas without having to do them in real life. Most fantasies are never carried out.I hope that you will ask your therapist for help with your homicidal and suicidal thoughts. I hear from many teenagers who don’t have access to any mental health treatment and who would be envious of your opportunity. You have that access, use it for your benefit. Your therapist can help you but not if you withhold important information from him. I wish you well. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My mother’s main principle in life is honesty. She taught my sisters and I to be loyal and always honest. My respect for her has dropped drastically since I discovered her affair with my sister’s sports coach. Through messages, they send nude images and sext constantly, to the point where she refuses to go anywhere without her phone because she fears someone will catch her, or because their affair has completely taken all her interest. I was sitting on the couch a couple months ago, with my phone beside me, coincidentally beside my mothers. It buzzed, and believing that it was mine (we both have white iPhones), I pressed the home button to view the text message. It was an explicit picture of his genitals, with a dirty caption and hundreds of winky faces. It was most definitely NOT my dad. Since then, I have spoken to one friend about it, telling her everything I felt since I couldn’t tell any of my counsellors at school (both of them are very close with my dad) or my sisters. The affair has progressed, I believe, because I discovered my mother has a hotel booked under her name every weekend in our city. Why would she need a hotel in the same city she lives in?<|im_end|>

 I’m sorry that you are in this painful position and have seen these shocking images and messages. Sometimes we get information that we would rather not have, but once you know it, you can’t go back to not knowing it. I’m also sorry that you feel that your mother is being dishonest.However, marriages are complicated and your parents may have agreements that you are unaware of and don’t need to be involved with. In other words, as painful as this is for you, your parent’s marriage is not your responsibility. They need to work through their own issues and you need to focus on being a teenager. But in order for you to disentangle yourself from the situation, I think it would be best to let your mom know that you have observed some of her private messages and have your suspicions as to what is going on.You can let her know how upsetting this has been for you and that you hope she and your father can work through this together. If you can’t find the courage to speak to your mom directly about what you have discovered, I would suggest that you first confide in a trusted adult, possibly an aunt, grandparent or adult family friend. For one, it will relieve some of your stress because you won’t be carrying this burden alone, and second, hopefully this person will have some insight on how best to handle the situation because they know your parents.Unfortunately, affairs are fairly common these days and committed relationships can change over time. Some couples are able to work through their challenges and remain together, others cannot. Either way, I’m sure your parents love you very much and would not want you to be hurt. If your mother is having an affair, I hope that someday you find a way to forgive her so that you can be close again. I’m really sorry that you are going through this and hope that there is a peaceful resolution.All the best,<|im_end|>"

 I feel everything is falling apart. I’m in a situation where everything is going wrong, but I can’t leave. I’m first year university student whose father is slowly dying. I go to an university where makes me more depressed(my parents pressured me to go there since it was close to home),but I can’t move because of my dad(I can’t even move out of the house, since I’m at school studying constantly and then helping out my dad at home). I’m an only child so I feel that even if my dad dies, I have to stay with my mom since we don’t have other relatives in the country. And, to be honest, I hate the place where I live and I want to move badly. But, it feels as if I can’t because of my mom, the fact all my contacts are in the city (and this is good for job opportunities). But, this place is killing me.<|im_end|>

 I am sorry that you are having a difficult time. It is important to put your situation in perspective. Your life was likely not always as difficult as it is now. You are facing a challenging time. Your father is dying. You recently moved and have begun college. You are in a new town and you don’t know anyone. Virtually anyone faced with that set of life circumstances would be struggling. It is understandable that you feel the way that you do.Having said that, is important that you know that suicide is never the answer. Yes, your life is difficult but it will not always be this way. You predict that it will be so but have no evidence to support that prediction. Depression has a pervasive effect and will result in negative predictions of the future. Ending your life is not the correct solution to your problem. The only appropriate solution is to seek professional help.Almost all colleges and universities in the United States have mental health professionals on staff. Those services are free of charge to all registered students. I would encourage you to locate the counseling center on campus and make an appointment immediately.Now, most of all, you need support and counseling. I hope that you will seek professional help. If you feel that you might harm yourself, go to the hospital or call 911 immediately. I wish you the best of luck.<|im_end|>"

Ok let me start with the fact i dont like to be mad but I get mad at everything and people dont help what so ever. Im a big guy and my mind is complicated and im always thinking about cutting someones head off or beating someones head in.I have killed people in self defense before but they almost charged me for it because their skulls were not in tact. I smoke marijuana to keep me calm and that helps but i cant always afford it and i dont like to talk to people who cant understand my mind. I went to a shrink a long time ago and she said i was fine. I dont know what to do when something is telling me to break someones neck or go after someone with a hatchet just to name some repeat thoughts. I use to grab pigeons off the street, break their necks and step on their heads.I use to take cats by their scruff and their tails and run them along brick walls. Their screaming made me laugh. I use to take frogs and lizards or anything i could catch by hand and rip them in half. Ive pulled peoples teeth out, removed finger nails, and put staples in people for information and enjoyment. I like shooting small game with buck shot because it rips them apart and it makes me smile. I use to make sure nobody messed with me in school in the third grade when i broke both my teachers hands because he put his ringer in my face. My friends dont say anything when i get mad because they are afraid, ive lost jobs over my temper and attitude and almost been to jail over people saying the wrong thing and me hitting them with my hands and breaking their jaw in five places. idk what to do and i cant afford anything. Please help before i end up in prison.<|im_end|>

 As your letter indicates, if something does not change, you are at risk of committing a more serious criminal act and going to prison. You must do everything in your power to avoid that outcome. If you can’t control your behavior, then you need outside help.If you want to know how bad prison can be, read Inside: Life Behind Bars in America by Michael Santos. Michael Santos was incarcerated for 25 years of a 45-year sentence for felony drug charges. I would provide an excerpt, but it would be too graphic. If you are interested, read his book. It will allow you to vicariously experience the horrors of prison life without actually having to be there.Another place to learn about horrible prison conditions are the many lawsuits filed against incarceration facilities. It’s fair to say that the conditions are worse than we can imagine. Some prisoners live in solitary confinement 23 out of 24 hours a day. They’re locked away in a cell no bigger than a parking space and have virtually no contact with people beyond correctional officers who have become desensitized to the plight of prisoners.Extensive isolation leads to severe mental breakdowns. If you want to see how bad prison life can be, watch the HBO documentary Solitary: Inside Red Onion State Prison. Red Onion is a super max facility in Virginia. One guard describes finding an inmate chewing a large hole in his arm. That’s only a snippet of the wretchedness of prison life. You’re free now, but without a change in behavior you risk being locked in a cage for the rest of your life. Watching the Red Onion documentary might help you to appreciate your freedom.If you can’t afford treatment, go to the local community mental health center. They often provide free services for those who cannot afford to pay. Tell them you want to meet with a therapist. A good therapist will know how to help you. They will be able to teach you alternative ways of handling strong emotions.One area of therapeutic focus may be sublimation. Sublimation is a defense mechanism where unacceptable impulses are transformed into socially acceptable actions. A therapist will help you to engage in socially acceptable behavior. That means expending your energy on prosocial instead of antisocial activities, positive instead of troublesome behaviors. It is not an overstatement to suggest that treatment could mean the difference between you having a good life or a life in prison.Start the process of seeking help by googling “community mental health” and your ZIP Code. Inquire about free anger management services in your community. If you have health insurance, call the one 800 number on the back of the card. Another option is to contact the local church to ask about their free counseling services. You might enlist your parents or good friends to assist you in finding treatment. The goal is to find free or low-cost assistance and to do so immediately before something bad happens.If you think that you might harm yourself or someone else, go to the emergency room at your local hospital. They will prevent you from harming yourself or others and they will ensure that you have follow-up services.It is important understand that hurting animals and people are immoral acts that are illegal. You have attacked creatures that were much smaller and weaker than yourself. They could not defend themselves. A friend once shared with me the words of wisdom told to him by his father. His father told him ” no matter how tough you think you are, there is always someone tougher.” Apparently, you haven’t encountered that “tougher someone.” The law of averages says that you will. It is only a matter of time. When that happens, you will be the one having your teeth pulled from your jaw or your eyes plucked from their sockets. It would be wrong for that to happen to you and it is equally wrong for you to do that to someone, anyone, else.You have attacked the weaker and helpless. How would you feel if you or your mother or sister was attacked by someone much bigger and stronger? Every religion, every nation sees such acts as reprehensible and beneath the dignity of humanity. Would you be alright with someone bigger and stronger ripping your teeth from your mouth or your sister’s mouth? I hope not. These acts are disgusting, immoral and illegal. There are reasons why you do what you do and feel what you feel. You need to discover what they are and change how you behave. If not you will pay dearly in this life and, as so many believe, much more dearly in the life that follows.You’ve already hurt people (in self-defense) and thus the risk of you doing it again is imminent, which is why treatment is necessary. If you don’t make changes, there is a high likelihood that you will lose your freedom, perhaps for the rest of your life.The fact that you are asking for help suggests that you are open to change and would benefit from treatment. That is a hopeful sign. Your writing this letter is the first step in making positive changes in your life. The next step involves you attending treatment and hopefully this letter helps you to find it. Please write if you have additional questions. Thank you for your question.<|im_end|>"

So much has happened in the last month I am not quite sure where to start, but here it is. Over the Christmas period my boyfriend was slightly distant, we live together but for Christmas day he went to his parents and I went to mine. He then came to my parents on Boxing day and although we all had a lovely day I noticed he was distant. Things seemed ok after that, however before Christmas he complained of an upset stomach and had not eaten much at all the week before Christmas. We put it down to a stomach bug as there seemed to be a lot going round but he was reluctant to go to the doctor. This ‘stomach bug’, however, then continued after Christmas.<|im_end|>

 Relationships can be difficult. When they are going well, emotionally they can provide feelings of happiness, joy, contentment and love. When a relationship is ending it can produce painful emotions, including disappointment and sadness.In every relationship it is important to be realistic. In this case, it appears as though he is ending the relationship. Even if he hasn’t told the world or you directly, he’s still pushing you away from him. Distancing himself from you is another way of ending the relationship. It could be that he is having problems with commitment. It might also be clinical depression or another issue that no one but he (and maybe not even he) is aware of. It is impossible to know with certainty because only a clinical evaluation could determine the cause but he is unwilling to seek help. He’s not willing to listen to the suggestions of you or his mother. Both you and she have expressed your concerns about his behavior and have suggested that he seek help, to which he has replied and essentially said “no.”Not only is he pushing you away but he is also moving away from his family and his regular friends. This might be his way of avoiding having to deal with his problems. New friends make it easier to step away from one’s problems. With his new friends, the level of conversation and interaction is likely superficial. It may afford him the luxury of not having to discuss deeper personal issues.He is not eating in response to stress and that is not healthy. It indicates that he is feeling strong emotions but as you noted, it’s unclear what the cause may be. The fact that there is no event that precipitated his unusual behavior is another reason why it is important for him to seek help. Unfortunately, if he is not willing to seek help, then there is virtually nothing that you or his family can do to force him into treatment. The standard for forcing someone into treatment is that they must be a danger to themselves or others. An individual might also be forced into treatment if he or she cannot competently care for themselves. It is very unlikely that a court would believe that he is incompetent and thus force him into treatment. He may not be eating well but he has a place to live, he’s paying his rent, he’s going to work, and he has a social life. It is evident that he should seek treatment but the reality is that no one can force him to do this.What should your response be in this situation? It is important to be realistic in a relationship. When you are being shut out you need to be realistic and to realize that no matter how much you may love him he is ending the relationship. Perhaps down the road he may receive professional help or decide that he wants to reconnect with you but at this time he has shut you out. In relationships, both parties have to agree to continue the relationship. When one party decides that he or she no longer wants it to continue, there is nothing the other party can do to change this fact. He has voted “no” to the relationship even if you have voted “yes.” You can’t even be his friend because he is not willing to communicate with you. You could be there in the event that he decides to reach out to you but it is important to recognize that the relationship as you knew it with him is over. It’s essential to come to terms with that fact, as difficult as it may be.I understand that this is a very difficult time for you. If you need extra support, don’t hesitate to contact friends and family. The more support you have during difficult times the easier it will be to deal with the pain and loss. Some individuals have found it helpful to attend a grief and loss support group when dealing with similar issues. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

I’ve been in therapy for the last 11 years, and medicated (Effexor 450mg daily) for the last 6 years or so. I go because of physically/emotionally abusive and traumatic childhood (to be brief). My concern is about my treatment. Despite therapy and medication, the fundamental aspects of my life have not really changed since I started therapy. I have no friends. I have not had a girlfriend for over 10 years. I’ve been unable to find consistent employment in my field of work, and have lived at home with my parents for the last six years, which for obvious reasons, doesn’t help my self esteem and personal motivation. On a superficial level, I make great efforts to conceal my depression and life state, but this requires me to keep people distant to protect my self, which not to mention is painful and lonely. These are conditions that have been consistent in my life, and I was hoping that therapy and meds would help, but I feel like I’ve hit a wall in therapy and have not progressed. Now I know that this usually means that this has more to do with myself and my issues and not the actual treatment. But lately I’ve really been entertaining the idea maybe therapy has it’s limitations. Or maybe my therapist and doctor are incompetent in their skills, experience, and abilities to provide me with treatment that I need. Maybe they are not a “good fit” and this would explain why therapy seems like it’s going no where. I mean my immediate suspicion is that because they are a PHD and a MD, they have big egos and are incapable of genuinely questioning their skill set, and attribute doubt and skepticism as symptoms of the patient. I’m open to the possibility that this perspective is purely skepticism, and indeed a symptom of my condition, But there are bad therapists and doctors in the world, and considering that in this society, professional incompetence, often has nothing to do with success, maybe this is not too far off. I bring this up because, aside from my therapist, I don’t have anyone else to discuss this with, and it would seem obvious that my therapist would not doubt her ability. Are my concerns genuine? How do I know if my therapist sucks?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Yes, your concerns are genuine. It may be that your treatment team has taken you as far as they can. It is not uncommon for people to “outgrow” their therapy. If you are not being helped, then it is time to find someone new.It is true that it can and often does take years to overcome psychological problems but with time there should be noticeable progress. When evaluating the type of care you have received, compare where you have been to where you are now. If there has been no discernible progress, then it is time to move on.Before you decide to fire your current therapist, consider consulting other therapists. Call and interview several others. Describe the problems that you are looking to solve in detail and inquire about the ways in which they would help you. What would they do differently from the current help that you’re receiving? What are their success rates? In what specific way would they help you? Those are the types of questions that you want to ask.Talking to other therapists has two main advantages. The first advantage is that you could gain a professional opinion about whether or not you should leave your current therapist. Secondly, in the event that you do leave your current therapist, you may find one that you like better.Another possibility to explore, before terminating your relationship with your current mental health professionals, is changing medication. It is possible that your medication regimen is no longer effective and may be contributing to the problem.I understand that you may be skeptical about mental health professionals but the actions of one or several individuals are not representative of an entire profession. Also remember that it is a matter of fit. Perhaps your current therapists are quite well suited to some clients but not as well suited to you. Even if your current therapists are not as successful with you as you would like, it does not mean that they are not using all of the skill that they possess, in your therapy. Each therapist is different, some very skilled in some areas and less so in others. There may be no one at fault here. I am sure that should you decide to try a new therapist, your current therapists would welcome you back if you decided to return. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

From the U.S.: I have been with my partner and his daughter for more than 6 years, when I met her she was 2 years old. How can I not have resentment over my 9 year old step child when she always brings up that she wants her father with her mother. She gives me look of distaste and attitude at times, but then sometimes sweet with me. She comes over on weekend to my partner and I apt from her mother’s house where there isn’t that much structure. She doesn’t like to bathe or brush her teeth, so I am constantly behind her to do these things. I have decorated her room so nice, but I feel like sometimes I am the outsider when she is over. I don’t like the feeling that I feel alone in my own place and I think when I have kids, how would she be. Would she cause them harm due to jealousy. Or now that she is growing she will cause teen drama in my home. I want my home to be peaceful and stable.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 Thank you for writing. The problem is not the child’s attitude. This little girl is acting in a way that is perfectly normal when we look at the situation from her point of view. Her life is complicated. Since her parents are divorced, she has to go back and forth between two homes — whether it is convenient for her or not. Few adults would agree to such an arrangement and yet we expect it of kids. On top of that, you have vastly different expectations of her than her mother. Your way may be healthier for her, but from her point of view life is harder at your house than at her mother’s. I think she essentially likes you because you say she can be sweet at times. But it’s just true that the adults in her life have made things hard for her and, understandably, she resents it.Ideally, you and your partner would sit down with her mother and create at least a few consistent rules around such things as bathing and tooth brushing, some basic chores and bedtime. When the adults can be adults and put the needs of the children first, the kids generally do much better. If that’s not possible, I think you should back off a bit and let your partner take the lead in teaching her and holding her to some standards. He is her father. You can’t be her mother. She has one. What you can be is a wise and loving adult friend. Instead of doing things for her (like decorating her room) in the hopes of winning her over, get involved with her on some projects. Find ways to give her a little more say in her life. As things settle down, you can take on a more mothering role, but for now it is only driving a wedge between you. It’s a little soon to be worrying about what she’ll be like as a teen. You and her parents have some work to do now.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"

I come from a very driven family and have always felt the need to be perfect, accomplished and intelligent.I have frequently accused of over-thinking things. Up until the last year or two, this condition has not bothered me. Recently however, it has started to severly hinder my life. I cannot trust my family because I feel as if I am constantly checking and rechecking their words or actions. Any time my mother gets frustrated with me, I instantly feel like I have failed and start defending myself. This has caused much strife between my mother and I. It has also tainted my relationships with friends. Sometimes, I feel so insecure and afraid I don’t want to be around any one at all. I want to push all my friends away and have everyone leave me alone. The worst time is when I feel this way with my significant other. I simply cannot allow myself to trust him even though I want to. I feel torn, unsure and scared. I am constantly checking and rechecking his words and actions. I constantly feel like I am not good enough. I have this huge fear of being compared to his ex girlfriends and I will never allow myself to accept a compliment from him, or anyone for that matter. I feel as if I can’t get my mind to be at peace. I just want to be able to trust someone and not constantly doubt them. I want to be able to feel ok with having someone be in my life and not feel the urge to run them off.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
 I am not certain exactly what you meant by the expression “constantly checking and re-checking” the words and actions of others. Does that mean that you are questioning them about what they’re saying? Are you attempting to ensure that what they’re saying is accurate? It would’ve been helpful to have had a more thorough explanation of what you meant by that phrase.Your inability to trust may be your way of attempting to protect yourself from being hurt. It seems as though you are constantly in a defensive mode. Individuals who are characteristically defensive often are that way because they don’t like to be wrong. Being wrong, in their mind, might equate to being “no good.” They don’t take criticism easily and feel as though it is an affront to the core of their being.At the heart of the problem may be a lack of confidence. If you don’t feel good about yourself, then what others say about you may be perceived as an attack. This hypersensitivity to criticism may be part of the problem.This problem is “severely hindering your life.” For that reason, I would highly recommend counseling. You stated that you do not want to “make a big deal out” out of this problem but left untreated, you risk ruining every important relationship in your life. Without those relationships, you will be unhappy. You may only need a few counseling sessions to adjust your thinking. I hope you will consider counseling. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My son came home from Colorado and has been drinking and smoking pot for about a year. When he came home he was a little paranoid but ok. He went to see some friends and partied for 3 days, he said he only drank. When he came home he was hearing voices and uncontrollable we took him to a hosp. and they admitted him and gave him some medication. He went into outpatient therapy, but that was not helping with his problems he needed one on one. We went to a social worker and she said he wanted to hurt himself so she called cops and had him admitted. He was there for 10 days because he did not want to take meds. He’s in outpatient again and the doctor has him on 1mg at night and 10mg Abilify. I cut the abilify to 5mg because when he was on 10mg he heard more voices and holding his head all the time and not functioning. The doctor still thinks he should be on 5mg in morning and 5mg towards evening. We tried that and the next day he was so bad we thought we were going to bring him to the hosp. again. I called the office and they said the dr. Knows what he is doing and I should listen to them. When I did not give him the extra Abilify yesterday he seemed much calmer and wanted to do something. I am not sure what to do next I have been looking for other doctors but either they don’t take our insurance or they don’t have any openings for a few months. Is it possible someone age 30 can be ok and 3 days later be schizoaffective who never had any signs. And what medication is good. Thank you from a concerned parent.<|im_end|>

 It is possible to experience psychosis after drug use, even if there were no previous symptoms. Drug use can trigger psychosis, at any age.People who have used illicit drugs, without negative consequences, are fortunate. Research shows that people who use illicit drugs have higher rates of psychosis than people who do not use illicit drugs. The simple truth is that drugs can be mind-altering and are dangerous. Had your son never used illicit substances, he may never have experienced psychosis.You didn’t mention the kind of drugs your son was taking. More recently, health officials are concerned with people taking synthetic marijuana, also known as “spice.” Emergency departments are reporting an increase in the number of patients coming in with “extreme psychotic behavior” after having ingested synthetic drugs. Despite their being banned in a number of states, it’s still easy to acquire these very dangerous drugs.Your observation about your son’s reaction to Abilify is important. The same medication may work well for one person and not well for another.The prescribing physician should consider your feedback. If he’s unwilling to listen, you are doing the right thing by trying to consult another doctor. It may take some time to find a doctor you like but keep searching. You want a doctor who considers your feedback and who is willing to make changes to the medication regimen, if necessary.Even though the doctors you have been trying to consult don’t have an opening, ask if they will contact you in the event of a cancellation. Cancellations are common.You might also benefit from consulting a licensed clinical social worker. He or she can assist you in finding a good doctor and help you manage your son’s condition. It’s always best to consult an expert when dealing with a possible serious mental illness.Abilify is a type of antipsychotic medication but there are many others. With the right medication, your son’s symptoms can be controlled and managed. Recovery is possible. Please take care.<|im_end|>"

My son is 3,5 years old, his father is coming to visit him after 2 years, I’m not sure how to act When I met my ex-husband everything seemed perfect, very soon our son was born and he seemed as he is a perfect husband and father. In the meanwhile we moved to another country, we lived there for 6 months, and after that me and my son came back to our native country. Reason was that I was pregnant again and ex husband didn’t want the baby. We are divorced and he married another woman. He didn’t come to Serbia since we came back and now he is coming to visit our son. First year of our separation two of them ‘talked’ through Skype, then I realized that it is not very good for my son to have that kind of a relationship with his father (it seemed like he is getting attached to a cartoon character) so I ended that way of communication between them, advising my ex-husband to call our son on the phone any time he wants. He didn’t call at all. Recently he send me a mail saying that he is coming to visit our son, he is staying for two weeks, and he want’s to spend as much time with him as possible including sleepovers. I’m not sure how is my son going to react, and I am really concerned what consequences will this bring to him. I would like to the best for my sons sake, so I’m asking you to help me, advise me how often is the best for two of them to see each other during those two weeks. Should I be there for my son first time they see each other, or every time they see each other.. My son is going to be almost 4 years old when this visit is going to happen, and I have no clue if his is father going to visit him ever again.<|im_end|>

 There isn’t a simple answer to your question. You didn’t mention your other child who will also be affected by this visit. Your ex-husband may not have wanted the baby but he is still the father. Your ex doesn’t seem to be thinking very clearly about the children’s needs. To them, he is a perfect stranger. They are not likely to respond warmly to him at first – which he may take as rejection. If his father doesn’t intend to keep up regular contact, your son is likely to be the one to feel rejected for yet a second time. Meanwhile, the younger child will have to live with his father’s lack of interest from the start.I don’t think you have enough of the information you need to make decisions. I suggest that you have several conversations on the phone with this man to try to find out why he wants to visit now and what his intentions are for a relationship in the future. Do talk to a lawyer about whether he has any legal right to see the children. Make certain you feel that the children are going to be safe with him, both physically and emotionally. By all means, stay with your son during the visits until you are sure that your ex has his best interests in mind and that he knows how to care for a four-year-old. You also need to know in advance whether the new wife is coming and what they think your children’s relationship with her should be. Once you have more information, I think you will be able to decide how to handle the situation. If not, do consider talking to a family or child therapist. A professional in your own country and culture is better able than I am to advise you in a matter that has potentially important consequences for all of you.I wish you well. <|im_end|>"
